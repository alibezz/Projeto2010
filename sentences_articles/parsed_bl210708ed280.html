<s i="0">Israel's exchanges of live prisoners and the remains of the dead with its neighbors are not nearly as easy to judge at the ethical or political level as the media and the politicians on both sides of the border would have us believe.</s> <s i="1">Unlike the view expressed by many, I happen to think that last week's exchange with Hizballah was, in historic perspective, relatively &quot;cheap&quot; from Israel's standpoint.</s> 

<s i="2">Israel gave up only five live Lebanese and the remains of another 50 or so Lebanese and Palestinians in return for the remains of two IDF soldiers.</s> <s i="3">The most notorious of the Lebanese, Samir Kuntar, had been in jail for some 30 years--an adequate deterrent against future Kuntars.</s> <s i="4">Compared to previous deals, this one was economical.</s> <s i="5">Israeli negotiator Ofer Dekel deserves praise for his efforts.</s>

<s i="6">Those efforts will now be directed at retrieving IDF soldier Gilad Shalit from Hamas, whose spokesmen are already citing the Hizballah deal, mysteriously, as justification for raising the price for Shalit.</s> <s i="7">Yet the circumstances surrounding the Israel-Hamas prisoner exchange negotiations are radically different from those that prevailed on the northern front, to the extent that few analogies can be drawn: Gaza, after all, is the scene of intermittent fighting and siege while Israel's Lebanon border is quiet; Israel's dealings with Hamas affect and are affected by its dealings with the PLO in the West Bank; and a neighboring Arab country, Egypt, is involved in all current Israel-Hamas discussions.</s>

<s i="8">Israelis are understandably upset over the triumphalism with which Hizballah, and Lebanon in general, received the repatriated Lebanese and Palestinians, dead and alive.</s> <s i="9">Show me who your heroes are and I'll show you who you are.</s> <s i="10">Kuntar, his pathetic televised denials notwithstanding, was the teenage murderer of Israeli children.</s> <s i="11">Dalal al-Maghrabi, now reburied in Lebanon as &quot;the first woman to lead a commando operation against the occupation&quot;, was killed 30 years ago while butchering Israeli civilians in a hijacked bus on the coast road.</s> <s i="12">The complicity of so many Lebanese and Palestinians in the orgy of patriotism and threats against Israel that accompanied their return is disgusting; the silence of so many other Arabs is deafening.</s> 

<s i="13">Contrary to Hasan Nasrallah's repeated boasts about having demonstrated Israel's weakness, most Israelis received a healthy reminder last week, as we buried our dead in quiet dignity, concerning just who our neighbors are and what we must prepare to do in order to deal with them.</s> <s i="14">Nasrallah doesn't &quot;know us&quot; nearly as well as he thinks.</s>

<s i="15">In general, Arab and Iranian portrayals of Israel's weakness because of the price it pays to retrieve its dead are bizarre.</s> <s i="16">When our neighbors demonstrate that an Israeli, dead or alive, is worth dozens or hundreds or even thousands of Lebanese or Palestinians, we are weak.</s> <s i="17">When a Syrian nuclear installation at Deir a-Zour is demolished in the night or an Imad Moughniyeh is assassinated in the heart of Damascus, we are presumed to be strong.</s> <s i="18">Make up your minds.</s>

<s i="19">Undoubtedly, the prisoner exchange issue demonstrates just how difficult it is for us to deal with the militant Islamist non-state actors on our borders, precisely because they play by different rules than sovereign state neighbors.</s> <s i="20">But those Arab state neighbors find dealing with militant Islamists no less difficult.</s> <s i="21">Lebanon has been reduced to a state of helplessness.</s> <s i="22">Egypt has no easy solutions for Hamas on its border.</s> <s i="23">In a better Middle East, hopefully some day soon, we and our state neighbors could sit down together to discuss agreed solutions.</s>

<s i="24">The controversy inside Israel over the price paid for the remains of two IDF soldiers held by Hizballah has motivated Minister of Defense Ehud Barak to appoint a commission tasked with standardizing Israel's approach to prisoner exchange issues in a way that neutralizes or reduces the influence of politics and the media.</s> <s i="25">But precisely because every instance is different, this will be difficult.</s> <s i="26">It would be more to the point to resolve that once Gilad Shalit has returned home, whatever the price, the government of Israel will undertake to release even &quot;blood on their hands&quot;</s> <s i="27">Palestinian prisoners not under duress, as ransom for kidnapped Israelis, but as a proactive incentive and reward for progress toward peace registered by responsible Palestinians who seek a reasonable mode of coexistence with us.</s>
