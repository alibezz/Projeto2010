<s i="0">Last week's Likud Central Committee decision to reject the Labor Party as a disengagement coalition partner is in fact a rejection of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's disengagement policy.</s> <s i="1">It both reflects and reinforces a number of important political dynamics in Israel.</s>

<s i="2">First and foremost, Sharon's debacle highlights the contradictions implicit in his own policy zigzags, contradictions he is apparently incapable of overcoming.</s> <s i="3">The general who talks peace doesn't have a peace plan.</s> <s i="4">The man who built the settlements now ostensibly wants to dismantle them.</s> <s i="5">And the leader who wants to disengage unilaterally from Palestinian territories is seemingly incapable of articulating persuasive reasons for doing so.</s> <s i="6">Those many Israelis who understand why we must disengage don't mind; but those--particularly in Sharon's own party--who need to be persuaded, hear no coherent explanations from their leader regarding demography, democracy and international realities.</s>

<s i="7">Sharon deserves credit for leading the country in recent years through trying times and finding military solutions for a large portion of Palestinian terrorism.</s> <s i="8">But he has consistently misplayed his political hand.</s> <s i="9">He could have kept his previous unity government with Labor if he had implemented the settlement restriction policies he now agrees to follow.</s> <s i="10">He could have had another unity government with Labor 18 months ago if only he had accepted Amram Mitzna's demand to dismantle the single settlement of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="11">He first opposed the fence, then built it as a crass land grab, and now faces (according to Attorney General Menachem Mazuz) a genuine threat of international sanctions unless he rebuilds the fence along the route he should have chosen to begin with.</s> 

<s i="12">Perhaps strangest of all for a politician of such legendary skills, he has badly misplayed his hand within his own party.</s> <s i="13">The man who created the Likud back in the 1970s is now perceived as flouting its institutions and policy pronouncements.</s> <s i="14">Two years ago the party central committee rejected Sharon's two state policy; in May 2004 it voted against disengagement in a referendum Sharon himself initiated; and now in August the central committee has put all 40 Likud members of Knesset on notice that if they cooperate with Sharon's plans to bring Labor into the government and proceed with disengagement, their political future is in doubt.</s> <s i="15">Under Sharon, the Likud has seemingly become a party dominated by thugs and the basest kind of influence peddlers: ask former Likud leaders Moshe Arens and Dan Meridor, who left in disgust.</s>

<s i="16">Another set of political dynamics is at work at the broader strategic level.</s> <s i="17">Sharon's setback last week reminds us that for three decades the Palestinian issue has been the single most powerful source of governmental instability in Israel.</s> <s i="18">As a corollary the threat of schism within the Likud--implicit in Sharon's resolve to proceed with forming a disengagement coalition--also follows a pattern that began in the 1980s, with right wing leaders Shamir and Netanyahu seeking however timidly to adjust to regional and strategic realities and being repeatedly thwarted by their own most extreme supporters.</s> <s i="19">Shamir lost the election of 1992 to Yitzhak Rabin because of the split in right wing votes.</s>

<s i="20">Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is also under attack from dissidents within his own political movement, and here too the root cause is the conflict and its effects on society.</s> <s i="21">But that hardly makes Arafat and Sharon two of a kind: the only characteristic that unites them (along with United States President George W. Bush) is that neither has a realistic strategy for peace or even for ending the violence.</s>

<s i="22">For all these reasons, from its very inception Sharon's disengagement plan had little more than a 50 percent chance of reaching fruition.</s> <s i="23">Now it has even less.</s> <s i="24">Labor may be losing interest in a coalition.</s> <s i="25">We have only begun to see the settler lobby and its allies in action, thwarting disengagement through political, legal and even violent means.</s> <s i="26">Both the IDF and the Israel Police are already intimidated by the task of physically removing settlers, each seeking to dump the job on the other.</s> <s i="27">The Egyptians, who might have elegantly greased the wheels of disengagement, have practically maneuvered themselves out of a genuine facilitator role by presenting impossible preconditions to both sides; their heart doesn't seem to be in this enterprise either.</s>
