<s i="0">Since Hamas took over Gaza we have been hearing new-old voices calling for the deployment of an international force in Gaza.</s> <s i="1">Both PM Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) have discovered a &quot;magic solution&quot; for the international community to save them from themselves.</s> <s i="2">Unfortunately, it is too little, too late for Gaza.</s>

<s i="3">When Israel withdrew from Lebanon it was obvious to everybody that if there were no one to replace us there, Hizballah would flourish and create a state within a state.</s> <s i="4">Yet Israeli leaders and the international community preferred to ignore the situation and did not insist on the full implementation of UNSC Resolution 1595.</s> <s i="5">Even then, the deployment of the Lebanese army would have been insufficient to prevent control by the Hizballah militia in South Lebanon.</s>

<s i="6">The unilateral disengagement from Gaza, disregarding Hamas' military capacity and Fateh's weakness, fragmentation and lack of will to fight, was also misinterpreted by Israel and the international community.</s> <s i="7">We all fell into our own trap of wishful thinking, believing that Abu Mazen, with the financial assistance of the Quartet and friendly Arab states, could make the difference.</s>

<s i="8">During the recent events in Gaza, Abu Mazen avoided giving the order to the Presidential Guards and the police to engage Hamas troops.</s> <s i="9">By not doing so he shares the blame, together with the Preventive Security force, for the defeat in Gaza.</s> <s i="10">He has also failed to unite the various security apparatuses under one authority.</s> <s i="11">He is further than ever from implementing the fundamental concept of government, &quot;one law, one gun&quot;.</s>

<s i="12">Accordingly, whoever calls for new elections in Palestine on the assumption that this time the results will be different than in 2006 is deceiving the international community.</s> <s i="13">Will the Palestinian people vote for those who drove Israel out of Gaza and humiliated the corrupt Fateh security forces, or should they vote for those who didn't even fight for their own families?</s> <s i="14">Can Fateh, fragmented as it is today, take on full responsibility in the West Bank?</s> <s i="15">How far is it from carrying out the internal reforms that would reflect a real change in the movement?</s> 

<s i="16">On the other hand, can Israel afford another &quot;failed experiment&quot;, relying on the non- promise of Palestinian security forces?</s> <s i="17">What are the assurances the Israeli government can give its constituents that a withdrawal from parts of the West Bank, removing the outposts and most of the roadblocks while confronting the settlers, would not be abused as in the past by radical Islamist groups.</s>

<s i="18">The concept of strengthening Abu Mazen has become a common denominator for the international community, the friendly Arab states and Israel.</s> <s i="19">This is a coalition of fear and mutual concern regarding the emerging radical Islamic movements.</s> <s i="20">But fear is not a policy.</s> <s i="21">Assisting Abu Mazen financially and equipping his troops are important steps, but these alone cannot replace the Palestinians' need for decisiveness and a strong will to fight for their principles and future.</s> <s i="22">Abu Mazen's good faith is not enough; he has to take the necessary steps to assure security.</s>

<s i="23">There is a paradigm shift among the Israeli majority.</s> <s i="24">Instead of &quot;land for virtual peace&quot;, the new formula is &quot;land for long-term guaranteed security and finality of claims&quot;.</s> <s i="25">The old assumption that once we achieve a comprehensive peace agreement, this by itself will bring security is no longer acceptable to Israeli citizens.</s> <s i="26">They will demand assurances from their government.</s>

<s i="27">Who can provide the missing security components?</s> <s i="28">If Israel withdraws from the West Bank in the current atmosphere of lack of determination among Fateh forces, Hamas will be victorious there in no time, just as in Gaza.</s>

<s i="29">There is a need for a third party security force to bridge the gap of will and capacity among Palestinians while at the same time assuring the security and stability of both sides.</s> <s i="30">A third party security role should start with a robust presence and its volume then be decreased according to agreed-upon performance standards.</s> <s i="31">The cosmetic old system of &quot;monitoring lite&quot;, such as EU-BAN or UNIFIL prior to UNSC resolution 1701, is no longer applicable.</s>

<s i="32">What will this require from the local players?</s> <s i="33">It will limit the authority and independence of Palestinian security forces.</s> <s i="34">At the same time it will assist them to carry out necessary reforms, equip them, and train and guide them to reach acceptable performance standards.</s> <s i="35">In parallel, Israel will have to agree to operational restrictions in areas that are jointly controlled by the Palestinians and the international force.</s>
