<s i="0">Last week's Mecca agreement between Fateh and Hamas seems to &quot;work&quot; in a number of different dimensions, some strategic and some tactical.</s>

<s i="1">At the broadest regional strategic level, the dramatic Saudi success in bringing Hamas and Fateh to commit to a unity government--where Egypt, Syria, Qatar and Jordan had all failed--ostensibly strikes a blow against Iran's hegemonic drive in the region and portrays Saudi King Abdullah as the preeminent Arab leader.</s> <s i="2">This is also an agreement that essentially bypasses Israel's and the Quartet's three conditions for dealing with Hamas.</s> <s i="3">As such, it reinforces the Saudi message to the Bush administration in Washington, first issued a few months ago when Riyadh threatened to provide military support to Iraq's Sunnis if the US withdrew precipitously, that the Sunni Arab world is taking its distance from failed American policies in the region.</s>

<s i="4">Judging by initial reactions, particularly in Europe, the agreement is likely to facilitate a restoration of contacts between the Palestinian government and at least some of the donor states and some of the Quartet members, like France and Russia.</s> <s i="5">A billion dollars in Saudi aid will help alleviate the Palestinian Authority's financial woes.</s> <s i="6">And at the tactical or local level, the agreement at least temporarily ends the Palestinian descent into violent chaos.</s>

<s i="7">But this is a best-case scenario for the agreement.</s> <s i="8">In fact, it is still much too early to celebrate an Arab and Palestinian success.</s> <s i="9">The unity government has not yet been formed.</s> <s i="10">Its guidelines are not known.</s> <s i="11">The key issue of control over security forces has not been conclusively resolved, not to speak of the fundamental political conceptual gap between secular Fateh and Islamist Hamas that could shorten the life of the new cabinet.</s> <s i="12">Any number of relatively minor events in Gaza could reignite the violence and unravel the new agreement.</s> <s i="13">The initial American reaction is cold, and the Quartet overall lukewarm: the unity agreement does not accept their minimal conditions.</s> <s i="14">An Arab-American disagreement over the new Palestinian government does not necessarily bode well for broader cooperation against Iran.</s>

<s i="15">All in all, the Mecca agreement could be a step forward or a step backward, depending on ensuing developments and on the way all sides now evaluate their positions and their options.</s> <s i="16">What should Israel do?</s>

<s i="17">First of all, we should &quot;keep our powder dry&quot; and watch and wait.</s> <s i="18">With a little prodding from Washington, PM Ehud Olmert correctly grasped that there is no need to respond immediately to events in Mecca.</s> <s i="19">The composition and guidelines of the new PA government, assuming it is formed, will be instructive as to its intentions.</s> <s i="20">We should listen to Abu Mazen at next week's projected Israeli-Palestinian-American summit and seek to assess whether the Mecca agreement has strengthened or weakened his position.</s> 

<s i="21">We should also sit down with the Americans and reevaluate the famous three conditions.</s> <s i="22">They are not cast in stone.</s> <s i="23">They were formulated hastily by Olmert and the Quartet in response to Hamas' surprising election victory and the formation of its government a year ago.</s> <s i="24">While it made sense to demand a pledge to end violence, the current ceasefire, however sporadic and incomplete, is no worse than previous ones periodically violated by Fateh.</s> <s i="25">It was presumptuous to demand of Hamas recognition of Israel when Jerusalem has never insisted that Arab countries offer this concession prior to signing a peace treaty with it.</s> <s i="26">As for &quot;adhering&quot; to existing agreements, Hamas has now undertaken to &quot;respect&quot; them, a semantic distinction that may or may not be significant insofar as both sides have hitherto violated many of their commitments.</s>

<s i="27">Then there are Israel's unwritten conditions or expectations.</s> <s i="28">Will this agreement provide stability and a greater degree of peace and quiet in Palestine, something Israel also needs?</s> <s i="29">Will it bring about the release of our abducted soldier?</s> <s i="30">Will it increase positive Arab influence over the course of events in Palestine?</s> <s i="31">Does this mean that both the internal and external, Damascus-based leaders of Hamas have, within the space of a year, begun moderating their ideology?</s> 

<s i="32">Alternatively, has Hamas successfully hoodwinked Abbas, Fateh and the Saudis, who have now unwittingly endorsed the Palestinian Islamist program?</s> <s i="33">Or is the Mecca agreement yet another flimsy unity structure that will soon collapse under the weight of Palestinian realities?</s>
