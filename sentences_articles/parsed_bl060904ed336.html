<s i="0">The prisoner issue offers one of the most telling manifestations of the unequal power relationship between Israel and Palestine.</s> <s i="1">Israel has thousands of Palestinian prisoners; neither the Palestinian Authority nor any other Palestinian organization holds Israeli prisoners.</s> <s i="2">Thus the question of release of prisoners is entirely up to the Israeli authorities, unless a state or organization friendly to the Palestinian cause is able to trade its few Israeli prisoners, or even the remains of dead Israelis, for Palestinian prisoners.</s> 

<s i="3">Palestinian prisoners in Israeli hands are an asset whose value is frequently misunderstood or mismanaged by Israel's government.</s> <s i="4">On the one hand, in the course of recent decades we have on several occasions released hundreds and even thousands of Palestinian (and a few other Arab) prisoners in order to redeem a handful of Israelis.</s> <s i="5">Recently we even paid such a price to Hizballah in Lebanon in exchange for a criminal, Elhanan Tanenbaum.</s> <s i="6">At the human level, both we and our Arab partner in the exchange seem to be acknowledging that a single Israeli, or even the body of a dead Israeli, is worth hundreds of Arabs--a source of pride perhaps for some Israelis, but also a problematic and demeaning ratio that only encourages our enemies to kidnap or otherwise capture additional Israelis.</s>

<s i="7">On the other hand, when the opportunity arises to release prisoners in order to buy the good will and improve the domestic leadership image of a positive Palestinian leader like former prime minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) during his tenure about a year ago, our leadership demurs.</s> <s i="8">Suddenly, prisoners who have served half their sentences--in some cases draconian sentences that have no parallel in the conduct of Israeli civil courts toward Israeli criminals--are too valuable to &quot;sacrifice&quot; for the sake of generating a chance for peace and security.</s> <s i="9">One dynamic that understandably toughens Israel's hand regarding prisoner release is the treatment of Israelis in Arab jails: Tanenbaum in Lebanon and Azam Azam in Egypt, for example.</s> <s i="10">The same prisoners not released to Abbas were traded a few months later for Tanenbaum.</s> <s i="11">Yet this was a tragic wasted opportunity on the part of the Sharon government; it reinforced the impression that Sharon is not interested in a genuine peace process, even when a genuine peace partner appears on the Palestinian side.</s>

<s i="12">Turning to Palestinian calculations, the prisoner issue is of very high national emotional significance.</s> <s i="13">More than 600,000 Palestinians, meaning a large proportion of Palestinian men in the prime of life, have gone through Israeli jails since 1967.</s> <s i="14">Many of Palestine's current security and political leaders are among them.</s> <s i="15">Prisoner issues are dealt with in the PA at ministerial level.</s> <s i="16">Some of the cruelest and most unrepentant terrorists in our jails are Palestinian heroes, yet other &quot;graduates&quot; of our jails are today among the most moderate and pragmatic Palestinian leaders.</s> <s i="17">Despite the overwhelming importance of this issue for Palestinian society, its leadership appears little inclined to offer Israel substantive concessions in return for the release of prisoners.</s>

<s i="18">So our jails remain full of thousands of prisoners until, periodically, things boil over into a hunger strike or some other manifestation of prisoner frustration.</s> <s i="19">No matter what justified punishment Israel metes out to Palestinian terrorists--there is no death penalty--at the societal level it appears to have little if any deterrent effect.</s> <s i="20">The Palestinian standard of judging the legitimacy of terrorist acts against our civilians will never approximate ours.</s>
