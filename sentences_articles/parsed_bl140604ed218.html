<s i="0">A Palestinian state seems to be the only part of the future Israeli-Palestinian agreement that is agreed on by all relevant parties: Israel, the Palestinians, the United States, and the rest of the international community.</s> <s i="1">The agreement, however, is superficial.</s> <s i="2">When we look beneath the surface to understand the parties' concept of the Palestinian statehood part of the solution, we find differences so significant as to render their agreement on a Palestinian state completely meaningless.</s>

<s i="3">Each party to the conflict has its own final status concept, but each calls it a Palestinian state.</s> <s i="4">When the Palestinians speak of statehood, they mean the complete Israeli withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem.</s> <s i="5">They expect to practice their right of self-determination by establishing an independent, sovereign, and contiguous state that can live in peace with its neighbor Israel alongside the borders of 1967.</s>

<s i="6">For Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the current right-wing extremist government in Israel, the solution is simply autonomy arrangements on the minimum possible part of the territories that encompasses the maximum possible number of Palestinians.</s> <s i="7">The Palestinian entity would have no real sovereignty and include no part of East Jerusalem.</s> <s i="8">Sharon doesn't mind calling this a Palestinian state.</s>

<s i="9">The American concept of the Palestinian state fluctuates according to changes in the Israeli government's composition and positions.</s> <s i="10">While there is a certain level of American influence on Israel, to a large extent the American position and extent of maneuvering vis-a-vis the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is a function of the Israeli position or extent to which the particular Israeli government can go.</s>

<s i="11">For all of these reasons, it is not very significant that the different parties to the conflict support the idea of a Palestinian state.</s> <s i="12">What counts, instead, is whether or not they agree on two things: (1) willingness to end the occupation, the ultimate source of violence and instability, especially since the Palestinians are determined to continue with the legitimate struggle until the end of this occupation; and (2) willingness to implement the relevant stipulations of international law vis-a-vis the conflict.</s> <s i="13">So far the differences on these two issues are very wide.</s> <s i="14">This explains the ferocity of the confrontations between the sides.</s>
