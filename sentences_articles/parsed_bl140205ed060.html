<s i="0">Some 19 months before last week's Sharm al-Sheikh meeting, in late June 2003, a somewhat similar summit meeting designed to launch an Israeli-Palestinian stabilization and peace process was held in Aqaba, Jordan.</s> <s i="1">It proved abortive; the roadmap that it launched went nowhere, Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas soon resigned, and the violence resumed after a brief and partial ceasefire.</s>

<s i="2">Last week's meeting at Sharm al-Sheikh has a better chance of success than the June 2003 meeting, for a number of reasons.</s> <s i="3">First and foremost, Yasser Arafat is no longer around to sabotage Abbas' efforts.</s> <s i="4">It is increasingly obvious that Arafat was indeed a major obstacle to progress.</s> <s i="5">Secondly, in the interim between the two meetings Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon launched the disengagement plan.</s> <s i="6">Disengagement, for all its drawbacks, constitutes a positive initiative around which the parties can organize a ceasefire and confidence-building efforts.</s> <s i="7">Both Abbas and Sharon appear to have drawn some pragmatic lessons from the failure of Aqaba.</s>

<s i="8">Further, Egypt, which hosted Sharm, was not even invited to Aqaba.</s> <s i="9">In the course of the past year Egyptian President Husni Mubarak has taken the initiative for Egypt to play a significant role in effecting disengagement and a ceasefire.</s> <s i="10">His motivation may be related more to Washington and the Egyptian economy than compassion for his neighbors, but his contribution is positive.</s> 

<s i="11">On the other hand, the United States, which convened Aqaba in order to launch the roadmap process, was absent from Sharm.</s> <s i="12">Paradoxically, this also constituted a positive contribution.</s> <s i="13">The American effort at Aqaba was half-hearted; President Bush, increasingly preoccupied with the insurrection in Iraq, never followed up with serious American involvement.</s> <s i="14">In the present case, Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice apparently understand that the current status of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires mainly security and reform measures, and is not ripe for a roadmap-based political process.</s> <s i="15">Hence Rice avoided Sharm in order not to inadvertently send a deceptive political message, and sufficed with the appointment of Lt. General William Ward to look after security issues.</s>

<s i="16">This points the way forward.</s> <s i="17">If Israelis and Palestinians are to succeed in the immediate aftermath of Sharm, and Americans and Egyptians are to provide effective support, we must all concentrate on a measured confidence-building process that focuses on mutual security, Palestinian reform, and cooperation to make disengagement work.</s> <s i="18">We must postpone any move toward renewing a peace process.</s> <s i="19">In other words, we must work on those aspects of roadmap phase I that both sides can handle, plus disengagement, and avoid getting into phases II or III.</s> 

<s i="20">At the Sharm al-Sheikh meeting even Sharon felt obliged to pay lip service to the roadmap and to offer a political vision of sorts for the future.</s> <s i="21">But he is hardly suspected of actively seeking final status negotiations with Abbas.</s> <s i="22">Nor will the Israeli public--which wants a peace process but doubts its feasibility--hurry him.</s> <s i="23">The Palestinian president, on the other hand, is under far greater pressure from his constituency to get back to peace negotiations.</s> <s i="24">But the time is not ripe, and Abbas' views on the right of return mean that a peace process negotiated by him will fail once again.</s> <s i="25">To push a reluctant Sharon and a hard-line Abbas into peace negotiations prematurely is to guarantee another disastrous failure and to jeopardize the disengagement process that Sharon is ready to carry out.</s> 

<s i="26">Hence, assuming Abbas succeeds in improving the security situation on the ground, and even if his method of dealing with Hamas focuses on cooptation rather than the roadmap-prescribed confrontation, Israel must compensate him generously in security-related areas like prisoner release, while the US and UK lead an international effort to provide material incentives.</s> <s i="27">In these areas generosity is warranted, because if Abbas fails the alternatives are not encouraging.</s>
