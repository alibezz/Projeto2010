<s i="0">The Iraq Study Group report enthralled people from all sides of the political spectrum in the Arab and Islamic world.</s> <s i="1">One might say the report set a precedent by meeting with the approval of almost everyone in the Arab world, a rare and unique instance indeed.</s> 

<s i="2">Of course, each party used and read the report according to its own perspective.</s> <s i="3">The &quot;moderate&quot; regimes commended the report for calling for direct US involvement in solving the region's problems, especially the core question--the Palestinian cause--because leaving the Palestinian cause unresolved and allowing Israel a free hand to continue its unilateral measures against Palestinians and their land has caused serious embarrassment to them.</s> 

<s i="4">On the other hand, &quot;hardline&quot; countries, mainly Iran and Syria and the forces they support, called the report proof of the need for America to fundamentally reconsider its policies in the Middle East.</s> 

<s i="5">There are two key sentences in the report.</s> <s i="6">One refers directly to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and states that the US &quot;does its ally Israel no favors in avoiding direct involvement to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict&quot;.</s> <s i="7">The other goes on to say that by pursuing a comprehensive regional program--the New Diplomatic Offensive-Washington &quot;would help marginalize extremists and terrorists, promote US values and interests, and improve America's global image&quot;.</s> 

<s i="8">The US administration was sent a clear message by Hamas' victory in parliamentary elections in January.</s> <s i="9">That message was that the political process after the 1991 Madrid conference has been a complete failure.</s> <s i="10">Notably, the report refers to Madrid rather than the subsequent Oslo process as the model to follow for progress.</s> 

<s i="11">A byproduct of the failure of Oslo has been the failure of Fateh, which pursued the Oslo process.</s> <s i="12">Thus failing to meet Palestinian national aspirations, Fateh failed at the polls.</s> <s i="13">The radicalization of Palestinian society is not the result of growing &quot;fundamentalism&quot;, but because Palestinian suffering deepened while and because illegal Jewish settlement building accelerated and the West Bank wall and other punitive and oppressive Israeli measures against Palestinians were implemented.</s> <s i="14">All this, despite the Palestinian &quot;moderate&quot; calls for peace.</s> 

<s i="15">In this context, when the report talks about the &quot;need&quot; for direct US involvement, a crucial term is missing: neutral.</s> <s i="16">The US was directly involved during the Clinton administration, and that was one of the main reasons for the outbreak of the Aqsa Intifada.</s> <s i="17">Why?</s> <s i="18">Palestinians finally saw clearly that the US cannot and will not exert real pressure on Israel to achieve a just and permanent peace.</s> 

<s i="19">The report supports a negotiated peace between the Palestinians and Israelis that could lead to a Palestinian state according to UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the land for peace formula, but fails to mention the &quot;Arab Peace Initiative&quot; or &quot;the 1967 borders&quot; or &quot;an international peace conference&quot;.</s> <s i="20">I don't believe those terms were missing by accident, especially from two major figures known for their vast experience of the Middle East.</s> 

<s i="21">The report gives impetus to &quot;moderate&quot;</s> <s i="22">Palestinians to renew, yet again, their calls for a resumption of the negotiations process, a process that we have already seen will waste 10 or 15 years and lead nowhere as long as vague terminology such as &quot;based on Resolutions 242 and 338&quot; continues to be used.</s> <s i="23">Camp David II negotiations were &quot;based on&quot; these two resolutions and such language fails to pressure Israel to withdraw from all territories occupied in 1967, the only genuine hope for the success of a two-state solution.</s> <s i="24">President Mahmoud Abbas, the Egyptian leadership and the Saudi Peace Initiative, even Hamas, have all recently talked about the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.</s> <s i="25">Even the Europeans have started to call for an international peace conference to solve the Palestinian cause, once and for all.</s> 

<s i="26">The timing of the report will be crucial for the next US administration.</s> <s i="27">This one is beyond hope.</s> <s i="28">But should that next administration, likely a Democrat one, translate the report's recommendation for active diplomacy to mean yet another round of fruitless negotiations, it will only serve to provide Israel with more time to consolidate its &quot;facts on the ground&quot;, culminating finally in Camp David III.</s> <s i="29">Once again, it will result in failure.</s>
