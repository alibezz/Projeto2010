<s i="0">Palestinian society has reached a new crossroads--one of many encountered in recent generations.</s> <s i="1">Indeed, the chronicles of Palestinian society comprise many such crossroads and few periods of routine.</s> <s i="2">The Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip have never enjoyed a single day of real independence; for years they have been struggling against a steady stream of rulers and enemies.</s> 

<s i="3">In the course of the past two centuries, the Palestinians have been ruled by four or five foreign regimes: they were exploited by the Ottoman Empire and subjugated by the British Mandate.</s> <s i="4">The West Bankers suffered deliberate discrimination under the Hashemites, while the Gazans were under tough Egyptian rule.</s> <s i="5">Then, over the past four decades, Israeli occupation inflicted deep wounds on one of the most &quot;ruled&quot; peoples of the modern era.</s>

<s i="6">By now it is clear that the Oslo agreements, too, did not generate any practical or cognizant change on the road to Palestinian independence.</s> <s i="7">Even the creation of the Palestinian Authority, the realization of a long-held dream for seven million Palestinians worldwide, emerged at a certain point as something distant and foreign.</s> <s i="8">Hence the Palestinian public punished Palestine Liberation Organization/Fateh by removing it from power, and installed in its stead a radical and fundamentalist religious body, the Hamas movement, to lead it in the years ahead.</s>

<s i="9">Yet the choice of Hamas rule by the Palestinian public does reflect a degree of continuity in terms of political behavior.</s> <s i="10">Prior to the emergence of the PA in the mid-1990s, the Palestinian public had focused its struggle on external enemies and foreign rulers.</s> <s i="11">After 1967, Palestinian society sharply opposed Israeli military government and sought to establish a degree of autonomy by choosing an authentic leadership hostile to Israel.</s> <s i="12">For example, in the late 1960s Israel wanted Muhammad Ali Jabri from Hebron to lead, while the public selected the &quot;Palestinian National Front&quot;, which was supported mainly by the Syrian Baath party.</s> <s i="13">In the early 1980s, Israel tried to impose the &quot;Village Leagues&quot; on the territories, but the local population responded by bringing the PLO into Nablus, Hebron and Gaza.</s> <s i="14">Now, in the 2006 elections, the Palestinian public produced a more extreme government than its predecessor even without outside involvement.</s> <s i="15">This time the enemy ruler was the PA itself.</s>

<s i="16">PLO/Fateh was not removed from rule of the PA merely because it was perceived as corrupt or due to unacceptable societal behavior.</s> <s i="17">In the eyes of most of the Palestinian public, the outgoing PA government of Arafat and Abu Mazen was too moderate in its approach to Israel and the West.</s> <s i="18">Accordingly, in keeping with the historical pattern, the public replaced them with a more militant and extremist leadership.</s>

<s i="19">Now, after a grace period of several months, the public is beginning to perceive the nature of the impending socio-economic disaster.</s> <s i="20">The Palestinians understand that Hamas will be unable to deliver on its promise of improved quality of life without changing direction politically--meaning abandoning its ideological approach.</s> <s i="21">Hence some Palestinians are already preparing for another change.</s>

<s i="22">Where is Palestinian society headed?</s> <s i="23">It appears once again to have reached a crossroads--a particularly problematic one.</s> <s i="24">There is no political alternative to Hamas; it is unlikely that Fateh and the other moderate movements will be returned to power in new democratic elections.</s> <s i="25">The Palestinian public has never become more moderate--only more extreme.</s> <s i="26">Hence there appear to be three possible scenarios for the near future:

First, a coup d'etat led by the Fateh leaders who command some 50,000 armed men from the various security forces.</s> <s i="27">Jibril Rajoub, the jailed Marwan Barghouti and Muhammad Dahlan have watched helplessly as power slipped through their fingers after years of struggle and personal sacrifice.</s> <s i="28">They are aware of the support they are likely to get from an economically battered public that would draw new hope from a coup.</s> <s i="29">To be sure, Hamas activists would oppose such a move, but Fateh, backed by Israel and the West, would win the day.</s> <s i="30">Israel and the West, incidentally, appreciate that it is easier to alter the PLO's behavior than to replace Hamas' ideology.</s>

<s i="31">A second possibility is that the economic pressure would simply &quot;not wait&quot; for political developments to catch up and the Palestinian street would speak by generating total anarchy, &quot;every man to himself&quot;.</s> <s i="32">Under these circumstances street fighting, looting and pillaging could become the order of the day and fitna--the civil war that Palestinians are so concerned about--would rage.</s>

<s i="33">In yet a third possible scenario, the territory of the West Bank and Gaza is divided among &quot;governors&quot;, modern Diadochi, who hasten to grab power in those areas where they have strong societal roots.</s> <s i="34">This would create a de facto cantonization, with one ruler, say, for the Mount Hebron region and another declaring his rule in Samaria, one ruler for the northern Gaza Strip and another for the south.</s> <s i="35">Each warlord would maintain military, economic and social independence in his canton.</s>
