<s i="0">The Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci once made the distinction between what he called �critical� and �organic� intellectuals.</s> <s i="1">Critical intellectuals are typical of developed civil societies, in which intellectuals view themselves as critics of power and as generally being non-conformists; organic intellectuals are more prevalent in societies in which individual moral responsibility is not highly developed, and intellectuals see themselves in the role of spokesmen for a collective identity.</s> <s i="2">The latter frequently appear in societies still in the throes of nationalism.</s>

<s i="3">This distinction may be helpful in assessing the role of Israeli and Palestinian intellectuals in their respective societies: it may also explain why so many attempts at �dialogue� between intellectuals from both societies have frequently been disappointing.</s> 

<s i="4">Most Israeli intellectuals--writers, academics, artists--view themselves as the moral critics of their own society, standing in the prophetic tradition of &quot;speaking truth to power&quot;--to the power of their own society.</s> <s i="5">Hence the Israeli press--and Israeli literature--are full of intellectuals and writers viewing their own society--its politics, its government, its dominant myths and narratives--through critical lenses: Amos Oz, A.B. Yehoshua and David Grossman are just three of the more prominent writers who represent this critical vein in the Israeli intellectual discourse.</s> <s i="6">Most of them view themselves as good Israeli patriots in a generalized sense, but they do not shy away from criticizing--in newspaper articles, books and media interviews at home and abroad--Israeli policies or some of the dominant Israeli myths.</s> <s i="7">There are obviously exceptions, but this critical role is true of most Israeli intellectuals.</s> <s i="8">Just read Ha�aretz.</s>

<s i="9">Most Palestinian--and Arab--intellectuals view their role differently: not as a vehicle for criticism of their society and its dominant values, narratives and myths, but on the contrary: as the true bearers of Palestinian (or Arab) nationalism.</s> <s i="10">It is for this reason, for example, that the most radical criticism in Egypt or Jordan of the peace treaties with Israel has come from intellectual circles.</s> <s i="11">For them, any accommodation with Israel, let alone Zionism, is a breach of faith, if not outright treason.</s> <s i="12">These intellectuals may be Nasserists, former communists or Islamic radicals; but they are indubitably intellectuals.</s> <s i="13">Few are the intellectuals in the Palestinian or Arab community in general who dare to speak truth to power, or question the basic narratives of Arabism: what has happened in the last years to perhaps the one truly critical Egyptian intellectual, Sa�ad Eddin Ibrahim, or earlier to Sadiq Jalal al-Azm in Syria, just shows how rare are the cases of such nonconformist intellectuals in the Arab world.</s>

<s i="14">This of course has far-reaching consequences for the general weakness of civil society and democracy in the Arab world.</s>

<s i="15">It is this discrepancy between the self-images of Israeli and Palestinian intellectuals which makes the encounter between the two groups so futile.</s> <s i="16">In the dozens and hundreds of recent Israeli-Palestinian dialogues, a familiar pattern emerges: the Israeli intellectuals usually appear, in various degrees, critical of their own government�s policies, occasionally also of some basic tenets of Zionism; the Palestinian intellectuals, on the other hand, repeat the Palestinian narrative, criticize Israel--its policies, sometimes its very existence.</s> <s i="17">Hardly ever does one hear a Palestinian intellectual question Palestinian policies, let alone the Palestinian master narrative.</s> <s i="18">If there is criticism of the Palestinian Authority, it is that it is too accommodating to Israel, or that it is corrupt--the latter being a merely generalized accusation.</s> <s i="19">Israeli universities hold dozens of conferences, in many cases with Palestinian participants, in which various degrees of criticism of Israel are voiced.</s> <s i="20">Hardly anything similar can be seen in Palestinian or Arab universities.</s>

<s i="21">It is because of this symmetry that so many Israeli-Palestinian dialogues became so one-sided--with both sides criticizing Israel.</s> <s i="22">It is for this reason that some Israelis have found these dialogues a sham and an exercise in futility.</s>

<s i="23">It is difficult to accept the claim that as long as Palestinians are under occupation they cannot appear to be &quot;disloyal� to their national narrative: Arab countries are not under occupation, and the lack of critical intellectuals in all of them is glaring--compared, for example, to the courageous appearance of many critical intellectuals in contemporary Iran.</s> <s i="24">And in the Israeli case, critical intellectuals appeared in the pre-1948 Jewish community, in the excruciating debate about whether to use terrorist methods against the British.</s>

<s i="25">Will this discrepancy between the disparate self-declared roles of intellectuals in these two societies change?</s> <s i="26">I don�t know.</s> <s i="27">Yet the appearance of the UNDP Arab Human Development Report, written mostly by Arab intellectuals, is a meaningful and hopeful harbinger of the possibilities of a fundamental change.</s>
