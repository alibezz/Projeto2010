<s i="0">One of the insights that emerged from the collapse of the Oslo process and the outbreak of the intifada in 2000 was the recognition that the Palestinian Arab community of Israel did not in fact constitute a bridge to peace with the Palestinian people, as Israeli Arab spokesmen had heralded throughout the heady Oslo years.</s> <s i="1">Rather, it had become yet another obstacle to peace.</s> 

<s i="2">The riots of October 2000, support for PLO positions on issues like the right of return, and collaboration with the illegal &quot;return&quot; of tens of thousands of Gazans and West Bankers to Israel--all sent a message to Jewish Israelis that the Palestinians of Israel saw themselves and were seen by the PLO as a bridgehead for the eventual Palestinization of Israel rather than a bridge between a Jewish state and an Arab state.</s>

<s i="3">To be sure, this is a crude generalization.</s> <s i="4">Nor were these by any means the politics of all Israeli Arabs.</s> <s i="5">But it was the Israeli Arab community's more articulate and extreme spokesmen, along with PLO leaders like Yasser Arafat, who set the tone in this direction.</s>

<s i="6">Recent years have witnessed radical changes in the political scenery surrounding the Palestinian issue.</s> <s i="7">Israelis have reacted to the collapse of the peace process, the intifada and the suicide bombings by opting for unilateralism.</s> <s i="8">Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza have elected radical Islamists who reject a two state solution.</s> <s i="9">Is there any role left for Israel's Arab citizens?</s>

<s i="10">Indeed, there is.</s> <s i="11">But it is not one they relish.</s> <s i="12">When the parliamentary crunch comes, the Olmert government can count on barely 60 members of Zionist parties (including Meretz, which is not a member of this coalition) to vote for an additional phase of disengagement.</s> <s i="13">The right wing will oppose the move vigorously, and the coalition's ultra-orthodox members are almost certain to defect.</s> 

<s i="14">That leaves ten members of Knesset from the Arab parties.</s> <s i="15">They oppose settlements and favor a Palestinian state.</s> <s i="16">But their attitude toward Prime Minsiter Ehud Olmert's disengagement plan is almost certain to be ambivalent: they will applaud the dismantling of settlements but oppose the strengthening of settlement blocs and their enclosure inside the security fence.</s> <s i="17">They will identify with PLO and Arab state opposition to any Israeli plan that appears to annex, de facto, settlement blocs and parts of East Jerusalem to Israel.</s> <s i="18">They will not identify with a plan whose declared purpose is to ensure that Israel remains a Jewish state.</s> <s i="19">And they will be watching carefully how the Olmert government handles sensitive laws concerning immigration to Israel of Palestinian spouses of Israeli Arabs, following the High Court of Justice decision upholding a highly restrictive law on this issue.</s> <s i="20">Their support, partial or whole, for Olmert's plan, is by no means a given.</s> <s i="21">Two of them reluctantly helped rescue legislative initiatives for the first disengagement, under Ariel Sharon.</s>

<s i="22">The MKs of the Arab parties are not Zionists, and their political positions render it very unlikely that they will be invited to join Olmert's government (even though Olmert has included and is courting non-Zionist ultra-orthodox parties).</s> <s i="23">In the post-election hubbub of coalition negotiations, budget debates and trips to Washington, they have been largely forgotten by the Jewish public.</s> 

<s i="24">But Olmert is going to need them and presumably knows it.</s> <s i="25">He will probably be able to claim no more than a Jewish plurality in the Knesset favoring his plan without them.</s> <s i="26">Hence he will still need their votes.</s> <s i="27">Olmert was prepared to pay a heavy budgetary and political price to bring Shas into his government, even though its spiritual leadership opposes unilateral disengagement.</s> <s i="28">By the same token, a lot more consideration will have to be shown--despite extreme ideological differences with regard to the future nature of the state of Israel--before even a portion of the ten MKs from the three Arab parties agrees to vote for Olmert's program.</s>
