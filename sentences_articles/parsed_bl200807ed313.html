<s i="0">Ostensibly, President George W. Bush's call for an international conference in the fall has created a political horizon.</s> <s i="1">In the American view, since the conference is likely to be the farewell party of the Bush era, it must succeed.</s> <s i="2">But what are its chances of success?</s>

<s i="3">The American initiative stems from a desire to compensate for ongoing policy failures in the Middle East.</s> <s i="4">Generally speaking, the occupation of Iraq has not enhanced regional stability.</s> <s i="5">To the contrary, anarchy in Iraq, the rise of Iran and the Shi'ites in the Arab world, Hamas' takeover of Gaza and continued growth in al-Qaeda cells all bear witness to the threat posed by the region to world order.</s> <s i="6">Beyond considerations of prestige, the need for a constant flow of oil at reasonable prices is cardinal in western eyes.</s> <s i="7">In view of these problems, progress toward a solution of the Israel-Arab conflict is intended to contribute to a reduction of threats from other sectors and an increase in regional stability.</s> <s i="8">Thus the international conference is an instrument for generating political negotiations in the hope of triggering progress toward solving additional problems.</s>

<s i="9">The conference idea in and of itself is not at all a bad one.</s> <s i="10">First, it ensures that the regional agenda is not determined and dominated by radical Islamists.</s> <s i="11">This is a convenient opportunity for moderate voices in the Arab world to join together and combat the forces that threaten their regimes.</s> <s i="12">Second, there are many indications that Saudi Arabia will be present at the conference.</s> <s i="13">Its participation is most vital insofar as it provides an umbrella of Islamic legitimacy.</s> <s i="14">The KSA has good reason to favor a conference that enhances its standing in Washington and the Arab world.</s> <s i="15">The conference also constitutes a natural extension of the Arab peace plan that began as a Saudi initiative.</s>

<s i="16">Yet the conference idea also generates not a few difficulties.</s> <s i="17">First, priority for the Palestinian track is liable once again to drive Syria toward extremism.</s> <s i="18">Lately there have been quite a few hints regarding the existence of a secret Israeli-Syrian negotiating track; this indicates that Damascus is not necessarily committed ideologically to the radical camp.</s> <s i="19">The US and Israel should not leave Syria out of this conference lest it seek to sabotage it.</s>

<s i="20">Second, the Palestinian track is extremely problematic.</s> <s i="21">The current split between Fateh headed by Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and Hamas bodes ill. Any progress with the one is liable to be vetoed by the other.</s> <s i="22">The attempt by the US and Israel to strengthen Abu Mazen, while helpful in the short-run, is liable to backfire in the long-run.</s> <s i="23">Hamas can make common cause with other regional actors interested in torpedoing any political initiative; an agreement between Abu Mazen and Israel will be condemned as a &quot;betrayal&quot; of the Palestinian cause, thereby rendering its realization that much more difficult.</s>

<s i="24">Correspondingly, an agreement enjoying broad Arab backing will have greater legitimacy and isolate Hamas.</s> <s i="25">Theoretically, Hamas can allow Abu Mazen a degree of diplomatic flexibility on the assumption that he will attain for Hamas what it itself cannot achieve without compromising its principle of non-recognition of Israel--in the hope that it will ultimately &quot;liberate&quot; the West Bank as well.</s>

<s i="26">A third difficulty regarding the conference is that as presently constituted it ignores the Lebanese track.</s> <s i="27">There is currently a struggle in Lebanon over the approaching elections between candidates supported by Iran, Syria and Hizballah and those identified with the opposing camp, with divisions cutting across ethnic community allegiances.</s> <s i="28">Just as the West is trying to strengthen Abu Mazen, so should it strengthen PM Fuad Siniora's pro-western government by inviting it to the conference.</s>

<s i="29">Accordingly, I propose adopting a &quot;multi-bilateral&quot; approach to the conference that would open up a number of simultaneous dialogue tracks: Israeli-Palestinian, Israeli-Syrian, Israeli-Lebanese and Israel-Arab.</s> <s i="30">Each track would have its own separate agenda dealing with its specific problems.</s> <s i="31">The Israel-Arab track would deal with regional issues such as economic cooperation, water, environment and tourism.</s> <s i="32">It would also address the questions of Jerusalem and the refugees that go beyond the Israeli-Palestinian bilateral track.</s>

<s i="33">The multi-bilateral approach has several advantages: it enables the bypassing of anticipated obstacles like Hizballah and Hamas opposition; progress in one track could positively impact the quality of negotiations in a parallel track; it could narrow the confidence and credibility gap that has developed in recent years; and it guarantees pan-Arab legitimization for any agreement reached.</s>
