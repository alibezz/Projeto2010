<s i="0">The prisoners' issue has always been an explosive one in Palestinian-Israeli relations.</s> <s i="1">Israel--the Israeli occupation and the policies and practices arising from it--has always relied heavily on putting large numbers of Palestinians in Israeli jails.</s> <s i="2">I remember at the time of my own four-year stint in the 1970s, the number of Palestinian prisoners was 18,000.</s> 

<s i="3">Given the circulation of prisoners who do not serve long sentences, the situation in the Palestinian territories has reached a point now where it is difficult to find a single family where at least one of its members either is not or has not been in prison.</s> <s i="4">In my case, I am one of four brothers of whom all have experienced prison time at one point or another.</s> 

<s i="5">Because imprisonment is such a widespread phenomenon, it has started to generate its own culture and this culture influences the political culture in society in general.</s> <s i="6">Even prison terminology has become part of the Palestinian public discourse.</s> 

<s i="7">When we talk about prisoners, we are talking about the huge number of people, either in prison now or in the past, who were active in the struggle against the occupation or at least were suspected by the Israelis of being involved.</s> <s i="8">As such, this is a very respected sector of society that has become, in its own right, a credible and influential community.</s> <s i="9">Most of those who occupied significant positions within the bureaucracy of the Palestinian Authority when it was established were and still are from among this community.</s> <s i="10">This is also correct for the security apparatuses.</s> 

<s i="11">Throughout the occupation, the prisoners' strikes have thus strongly influenced the Palestinian street.</s> <s i="12">There have been several upheavals that, within a few weeks to a few months spread all over the territories in the course of prisoner solidarity campaigns.</s>

<s i="13">Part of this deeply felt empathy is that the public at large identifies strongly with the objectives and activities of the prisoners.</s> <s i="14">There is a feeling among the public that the prisoners in a way are serving their sentences on behalf of all society.</s> <s i="15">In addition, the horrible stories of torture that people hear from prisoners themselves and from prisoners' relatives, increases this tendency and the desire to show solidarity.</s>

<s i="16">The stories released from Abu Ghreib prison in Iraq, once they caught the world's attention, reminded many Palestinian of their own personal experiences or stories that were heard from relatives and friends, experiences that go much beyond the stories that were published out of Abu Ghreib.</s> <s i="17">Unfortunately, in our case the issue garnered much less international media attention.</s>
