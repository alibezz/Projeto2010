<s i="0">After a short period during which the Palestinians finally took their fate in their own hands by accepting and partly implementing the Oslo agreements, the situation has changed.</s> <s i="1">The violent al-Aqsa intifada and the radicalization of the Palestinian street as expressed in the Hamas victory of January 2006 have allowed the growing intrusion of Islamist players interested in derailing the negotiating process.</s>

<s i="2">Beginning with Iran, the Hamas victory in the elections is seen as a golden opportunity to enhance Tehran's influence in the region.</s> <s i="3">In mid-April 2006, Iran organized a three-day conference in Tehran that brought together some 600 Palestinian leaders and their supporters from Muslim countries.</s> <s i="4">Hamas Secretary General Khaled Meshaal declared at the conference that his government would never recognize Israel.</s> <s i="5">Iran pledged $50 million in aid to the Hamas government.</s> 

<s i="6">The price of this support is escalation against Israel as requested by President Mahmoud Ahmadinezhad during his visit to Damascus in late January 2006.</s> <s i="7">He stressed that jihad by Hizballah and several Palestinian terrorist organizations was an important component of a global jihad against the US-led West: &quot;Palestine is the center of the final stages of the battle between Islam and arrogance.&quot;</s>

<s i="8">For his part, Meshaal promised in December 2005 that &quot;if Israel attacks Iran, then Hamas will widen and increase its confrontation against Israelis inside Palestine.&quot;</s> 

<s i="9">Recent years have also witnessed a steep rise in Hizballah involvement in Palestinian terrorism.</s> <s i="10">In 2002, seven Palestinian groups were operated by Hizballah, in 2003 there were 14, and in 2004, 51 such groups.</s> 

<s i="11">In spite of pressure on Hizballah to disarm, its leaders have not renounced Palestinian violence.</s> <s i="12">Lately, Hizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah acknowledged giving Palestinian factions financial and political support, but claimed delivery of weapons stopped in December 2001.</s> <s i="13">This denial is contradicted by hard facts, such as the Karine-A affair and the arrest of Hizballah explosives experts on their way by sea to train Palestinians in Gaza.</s>

<s i="14">Turning to al-Qaeda, until 9/11 Osama bin Laden assigned low priority to the Palestinian cause.</s> <s i="15">But following al-Qaeda's demise in Afghanistan he upgraded Palestine as a top priority; in parallel there was a sharp increase in jihadi suicide attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets, such as the April 2002 bombing of the historic synagogue in Djerba, Tunisia and the November 2002 attack against an Israeli-owned hotel in Mombassa, Kenya.</s>

<s i="16">Since 2002, when the first Qaeda attempt to recruit a Palestinian militant in Gaza was foiled, there are signs that the organization has stepped up its presence, especially in Gaza.</s> <s i="17">A new radical Muslim terrorist group, Jundallah or &quot;Allah's Brigades&quot;, especially active in Gaza, launched its first attack on IDF soldiers in May 2005.</s> <s i="18">In August 2005 a group calling itself The Jihad Brigades in the Land of the Outpost issued a declaration describing a rocket operation against Israeli settlements.</s>

<s i="19">Credit for the firing of katyusha rockets from southern Lebanon into Israel on the night of December 27, 2005 was claimed by Al-Qaeda's Committee in Mesopotamia (Iraq) led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.</s> <s i="20">In his April 2006 video, Zarqawi declared: &quot;We are fighting in Iraq, but our eyes are set upon Jerusalem.&quot;</s> <s i="21">According to PA officials, al-Qaeda operatives have crossed into the Gaza Strip from Egypt since Israel abandoned the Rafah border crossing, helped by the lawlessness since Hamas emerged as winner of the elections.</s> 

<s i="22">Bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and al-Zarqawi criticized Hamas for its participation in the elections in their March 2006 video clips and warned the party against contamination by the secular political process.</s> <s i="23">Meshaal, in response, claimed that Hamas' conduct of politics &quot;served the resistance&quot;.</s> <s i="24">Interestingly, bin Laden himself in his April 23, 2006 video did not make the same criticism but pointed to the isolation of Hamas by the international community as proof that the &quot;West's rejection of Hamas affirms that this is a Crusader-Zionist war against Muslims.&quot;</s> <s i="25">Perhaps he sees a positive side to an Islamist government in power in the PA and its capacity to influence other countries with strong Islamist movements, such as Egypt and Syria.</s>

<s i="26">At the regional level, Egypt and Jordan consider that Hamas' success in gaining control of the PA could not only radicalize Palestinians and the conflict with Israel but also constitute a dangerous precedent for their own Islamists.</s> <s i="27">At the same time, they worry that too much opposition to Hamas could produce instability in the West Bank and Gaza, and they do not want to be portrayed as adversaries of a democratically elected Palestinian government.</s> 

<s i="28">After Hamas publicly endorsed the last suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, both Egypt and Jordan refused to meet with the PA's foreign minister, Mahmoud al-Zahar.</s> <s i="29">More critically, Jordanian Prime Minister Marouf Bakheet accused Hamas of smuggling &quot;rockets, explosives, and automatic rifles&quot; from Syria.</s> <s i="30">Jordan arrested members of the organization who received instructions from a Hamas leader in Syria and were planning to carry out attacks in the country.</s> <s i="31">Hamas rejected the allegations as &quot;outright brazen lies&quot;, but PA President Mahmoud Abbas seemed implicitly to accept their veracity by describing the charges as &quot;shocking and dangerous&quot;.</s>

<s i="32">It would appear, then, that events in the Palestinian sphere are being influenced by converging and even conflicting Islamist trends.</s>

<s i="33">Iran is interested in helping the Hamas-led government stabilize the situation and take control of the PA. But at the same time, against a backdrop of international pressure over its nuclear ambitions, it is using Islamic Jihad to carry out attacks in Israel.</s> <s i="34">As the crisis concerning the nuclearization of Iran approaches a critical stage, Hizballah, the Palestinian Islamist organizations and al-Qaeda could be used to provoke a regional crisis inside the West Bank and Gaza or at Israel's northern border with Lebanon.</s>

The Hamas victory could negatively influence the stability of Egypt and Jordan, while growing activity by al-Qaeda terrorists in Sinai could represent a direct threat to Israel and the PA.
