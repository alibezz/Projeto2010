<s i="0">Last year was bad for Israel and for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</s> <s i="1">The new year, 2007, is not likely to be much better.</s> <s i="2">Indeed, in many ways it is liable to offer a continuation of the negative developments of 2006.</s> 

<s i="3">Last year began with the disappearance from the scene of PM Ariel Sharon and the election of Hamas to head the Palestinian Authority government.</s> <s i="4">Midway through the year, open warfare broke out between Israel and Hamas (and Hizballah in Lebanon).</s> <s i="5">One of its casualties was the plan of PM Ehud Olmert to continue unilateral Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank.</s> <s i="6">Another was Olmert's status as a leader enjoying broad support and considered capable of making sound national security decisions.</s> 

<s i="7">Toward the end of the year, a fragile Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire took hold in Gaza; tentative discussions of confidence-building measures took place between PM Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen).</s> <s i="8">On the other hand, Hamas and Fateh factions clashed in Gaza and the West Bank in what threatened to deteriorate into civil war.</s>

<s i="9">Meanwhile, US President George W. Bush, the only third party considered capable of exercising the leadership necessary to galvanize an Israeli-Palestinian peace process, last year confronted the consequences of his misconceived and badly-managed policies in Iraq, particularly those that strengthened Iran, and of his Middle East regional democratic reform program that ended up enfranchising militant Islamists in Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine.</s> <s i="10">Yet he seemed to learn little from his failures.</s> <s i="11">Meanwhile, his leadership profile was weakened further by mid-term elections swept by the Democrats.</s> <s i="12">Hence Bush is even less likely to devote his energies to Israelis and Palestinians in his last two years in office than he did during his first six years.</s>

<s i="13">There were only two positive notes last year--silver linings of a very dark cloud.</s> <s i="14">One was the growing readiness evinced by Israel's moderate Sunni Arab neighbors, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, to engage more seriously in at least stabilizing the Israeli-Palestinian situation.</s> <s i="15">They did so largely out of a perceived need to make common cause with Israel against Iran--they must persuade their publics that progress toward peace with the Palestinians renders Israel an acceptable partner in this broader strategic endeavor.</s> <s i="16">This underlines the increasing preoccupation of Israel and the region with the Iranian threat rather than, or at least alongside, the Palestinian deadlock.</s> 

<s i="17">A second positive development was the readiness of the international community, led by Europe, to play a role on the ground in Lebanon and Gaza.</s> <s i="18">Here, too, the concern is Iran and militant Islam at least as much as the Palestinian issue.</s>

<s i="19">In view of the largely negative legacy of 2006, what can we expect from 2007?</s> 

<s i="20">The US, Israel, Abu Mazen and the moderate Arabs will likely make an effort to create a modicum of positive momentum.</s> <s i="21">It may even be called a peace process, but it will almost certainly not be one.</s> <s i="22">Rather, it will consist, in the best case, of well-publicized summit meetings and CBMs like prisoner release, removal of West Bank checkpoints and transfer of funds--the latter two already underway.</s> <s i="23">In a best case scenario, Israel and its neighbors will sit down with American and European backing to begin discussing the Arab League/Saudi peace plan of March 2002.</s> 

<s i="24">Meanwhile, inside Palestine Fateh-Hamas tensions will increase, possibly producing civil war, possibly elections, almost certainly more violence.</s> <s i="25">In parallel, inside Israel Olmert's government will continue to display a low capability of dealing with heavy national security issues.</s> <s i="26">The outcome or even expectation of the Winograd Commission report on the mismanagement of the war in Lebanon, coupled with Labor Party primaries in May, could conceivably bring about a government reshuffle or even new elections.</s>
