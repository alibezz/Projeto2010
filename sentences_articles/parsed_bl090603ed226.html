<s i="0">The history of American foreign and defense policy since the beginning of the twentieth century comprises dramatic shifts between phases of intensive involvement in the international arena, and periods of relative or complete disengagement from the outside world.</s> <s i="1">The intense involvement phase originates in a desire to reshape the external environment on the basis of new premises; the disengagement phase is characterized by the absence of any effort to influence developments abroad, as in the period between the two world wars.</s>

<s i="2">United States President Woodrow Wilson sought to build a new world order on the basis of his &quot;Fourteen Points,&quot; and viewed American entry into World War I as the necessary springboard for promoting his sweeping political, ideological and territorial vision.</s> <s i="3">But the administrations which followed his presidency largely avoided such a sweeping definition of the changes required in the domestic structure and modus operandi of the national units comprising this system.</s>  <s i="4">At the outset of the Cold War several American leaders, such as John Foster Dulles, who served as secretary of state in President Dwight Eisenhower�s administration between 1953-1959, did occasionally allude to the need to roll the Soviet empire back from Eastern Europe.</s> <s i="5">But their actual policy was largely rooted in the defensive premises of containment, deterrence and coercion.</s>

<s i="6">An examination of the first eight months of George W. Bush�s tenure as president indicates that they were predicated upon these traditional principles of containment and deterrence.</s> <s i="7">The Bush foreign and defense policy elites were initially predisposed to pursue a unilateralist, largely exclusionist posture.</s> <s i="8">They sought to minimize the risk of military entanglements in third-world areas, and instead to rely upon the tools of deterrence and coercive diplomacy in confronting threats to American security, including in the Iraqi context.</s> 

<s i="9">Indeed, during the period which preceded the September 11 attacks, the neo-conservative belief that American foreign policy should be prepared, in confronting national security threats, to take the initiative rather than merely to react, and thus in the absence of broad international support to unilaterally launch preventive strikes by using American military hegemony to destroy the forces of international terrorism, amounted to nothing more than an intellectual platform.</s> <s i="10">Notwithstanding the fact that the neo-conservative agenda came to increasingly permeate and shape the thinking of policymakers like Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and defense planners and analysts at the Pentagon during the last decade, it was only in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 that it was translated into an official and operational guide for action.</s> 

<s i="11">Thus by virtue of its magnitude and impact upon American strategic thinking, the tragedy of September 11 can be viewed as a formative traumatic event which precipitated a change in the traditional modus operandi of American foreign policy.</s> <s i="12">From the conservative pole of defending the status quo that policy moved to the revisionist extreme of seeking to transform the entire international system so that it would conform with American ideas, values and institutions.</s> <s i="13">The Iraqi campaign was the first step in this direction.</s> 

<s i="14">It is against the backdrop of this sweeping neo-conservative doctrine that the recent American preoccupation with the Palestinian issue, most clearly manifested in the Sharm al-Sheikh and Aqaba summits, should be viewed.</s> <s i="15">This doctrine envisions a direct linkage between the Iraqi campaign and the subsequent transformation in the structure of other regional social and political systems.</s> <s i="16">Thus it was only natural for President Bush to look for regional windows of opportunity for progress along the route toward the Wilsonian goal of democracy.</s> <s i="17">It is at this juncture that the roadmap of the Quartet, combined with the election of Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) as the Palestinian prime minister, became the main springboard for the administration in its effort to translate its strategic and ideological thinking into a new regional reality.</s>

<s i="18">The president brought to this effort new leverage as an undisputed hegemon.</s> <s i="19">He had recently comprehensively demonstrated, in Iraq, his readiness to use force to combat the threat inherent in rogue states and in international terrorism, as the means of laying the groundwork for a new--and democratic--regional environment.</s> <s i="20">While his initial effort in the Israeli-Palestinian context may appear successful in the immediate aftermath of the Aqaba summit, this does not guarantee, of course, that the roadmap will be smoothly implemented.</s> <s i="21">With the parties still separated by irreconcilable views concerning core issues, and with the president about to become increasingly preoccupied with the requirements of the 2004 presidential campaign, the road toward reconciliation may still be long and rocky, particularly as the shadow of terrorism looms as a constant threat to the entire process.</s>
