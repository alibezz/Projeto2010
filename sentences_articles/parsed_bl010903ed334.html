<s i="0">The troubled circumstances of Palestinians in the occupied territories today most aptly demonstrate the extent and depth of the fascism of the Israeli occupation.</s> <s i="1">Systematic acts of assassination are at their height.</s> <s i="2">More and more Palestinian mothers and families have their hearts broken at the hands of what I call the &quot;slaughter of Sharon.&quot;</s> <s i="3">This is taking place to deafening Arab silence and in the midst of international ineptitude.</s> <s i="4">The curfews continue and Israeli jails continue to fill with Palestinian prisoners in intolerable conditions.</s> <s i="5">In addition, the new Berlin wall, a wall of isolation, continues to snake through Palestinian land.</s> <s i="6">In other words, one might say that, for Palestinians, the roadmap has been turned into a path of blood, anguish and suffering.</s> 

<s i="7">At the same time, and I write this with deep regret and sorrow, we have a Palestinian cabinet headed by Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) that continues to engage in political mismanagement.</s> <s i="8">In my view, this mismanagement is negatively affecting Palestinian national interests tremendously.</s> <s i="9">Incongruently, and despite the dramatic state of affairs I have just described, Abu Mazenï¿½s government has not called for suspending talks with the Israeli occupation institution, but has instead called for cutting off talks with Palestinian resistance groups.</s> <s i="10">Instead of directing its anger and its energies at pressuring the Israeli government to end its violations, we find this government almost across the board doing its best to weaken the struggle against the occupation.</s> 

<s i="11">Several statements by cabinet ministers damning the Palestinian resistance have contributed to the recent escalation of tensions within Palestinian society.</s> <s i="12">The assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Abu Shanab by Israeli warplanes interrupted the beginnings of a serious Palestinian feud.</s> <s i="13">A cabinet whose ministers consider Palestinian resistance--not the tenacity and belligerence of the Israeli occupation--damaging to Palestinian national interests does not express the feelings of the Palestinian street and does not represent Palestinian ambitions.</s> <s i="14">(It must be said that not every minister in this government bears the same culpability, and some statements of sanity have made their way through the fog.)

Who is it that defines Palestinian national interests more so than the active and the functional political forces on the ground?</s> <s i="15">These are forces that emanate out of Palestinian suffering--deep suffering--and it is these forces that work diligently to put an end to Palestinian suffering, not this or that cabinet minister.</s> 

<s i="16">Today, the Palestinian situation is in a precarious position and it is time for wisdom and rationality to dominate over conspiratorial tactics.</s> <s i="17">The symbol of Palestinian nationalism, Yasser Arafat, deserves this; the difficult struggle endured by the Palestinian people merits this; and the retention of Palestinian rights, which are in my view more sacred than the land itself and all its holy sites, make this imperative.</s> <s i="18">The sanctity of our rights demands the semblance of stability.</s>

<s i="19">The United States, for its part, seems to be terribly pleased that it has found domestic tools that will work diligently to achieve its objectives in Palestinian society.</s> <s i="20">These objectives, which are bound to fail, mean to weaken the Palestinian struggle, to marginalize Yasser Arafat and to work in a calculated way to assassinate him politically and morally in the eyes of Palestinian society, which he loves and which loves him.</s> <s i="21">The role of the United States, which centers on meddling in Palestinian politics to strengthen and maintain some members of the Abbas government, does not take into account Palestinian interests nor has it put an end to any single aspect of the Israeli occupation.</s> <s i="22">The larger objective of the United States is to make the Palestinian struggle unacceptable to Palestinians themselves; finding Palestinian tools to achieve this has been a most gratifying development for the Bush administration.</s> 

<s i="23">Let me give just one example.</s> <s i="24">Why, instead of exerting pressure on the Palestinian government to freeze the accounts of Islamic charitable organizations, did not the Bush administration and the Palestinian government itself work first to find a substitute for the thousands of needy families that rely on those organizations for their daily bread?</s> <s i="25">Freezing these accounts and providing no alternative only strengthened the Islamic movements, as they have now been handed a new mobilization tool through which to shore up their backing in Palestinian society.</s>

<s i="26">It is time for the Abbas government to save face and apologize to the Palestinian people--a people that has contributed thousands of martyrs and wounded to this struggle--for the recent comments of its ministers.</s> <s i="27">Indeed, it may be time for this government to courageously resign of its own volition: first, because it is no longer acceptable to Palestinian society, but more so because it is no longer accepted by Fateh, the forefront of the Palestinian struggle.</s>

<s i="28">This government can no longer shift the Palestinian people from one political catastrophe to another.</s> <s i="29">It is not acceptable for the Palestinian government to move the Palestinian people further towards fragmentation and dispersal.</s> <s i="30">The situation that we find ourselves in has no room for added experimentation with Palestinian lives and the destiny of the Palestinian cause.</s>
