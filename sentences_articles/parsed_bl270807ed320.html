<s i="0">The status of Fateh-Hamas relations is currently closely intertwined with the course of the two Palestinian movements' interaction with Israel.</s> <s i="1">In the months ahead, that triangular relationship could play itself out in a number of ways.</s>

<s i="2">The first and most obvious scenario is the present course of events.</s> <s i="3">Israel and Fateh/Ramallah have embarked on a two-track process that involves confidence- and institution-building along with an attempt to draw up a new declaration of principles for final status.</s> <s i="4">They, along with the US and most of the Quartet, are boycotting Hamas/Gaza.</s> <s i="5">The underlying concept of this approach holds that success in creating peace and prosperity in the West Bank, coupled with misery in Gaza, will somehow topple Hamas through grassroots pressure.</s> <s i="6">Alternatively, it holds out the prospect that the Hamas leadership will passively accept Fateh's two-state deal with Israel and breathe a sigh of relief because this would allow Hamas to have its ideological cake--refusal to recognize Israel--and eat it too, with Fateh taking care of coexistence issues with Israel.</s>

<s i="7">According to this approach, Hamas' violent takeover of Gaza last June, which by any standard signaled the abject failure of American, Israeli and Fateh policy, is now defined as a &quot;window of opportunity&quot; for those three actors to regroup and outflank Hamas at the peace table.</s> <s i="8">The political dilemma shared by the three weak leaders--PM Ehud Olmert, President Mahmoud Abbas and President George W. Bush--is now being &quot;spun&quot; to create a virtual moment of strength.</s> 

<s i="9">This concept willfully ignores Hamas' capacity to torpedo the new process through violence.</s> <s i="10">It downplays the real, extreme nature of the Hamas leadership.</s> <s i="11">It makes light of Abbas' weakness as a leader.</s> <s i="12">And it falls into the old fallacy first promoted by Moshe Dayan and Shimon Peres that economic prosperity will win the hearts and minds of Palestinians who are otherwise committed to a more extreme agenda.</s>

<s i="13">Alternative future scenarios for the Israel-Fateh-Hamas triangular relationship are not much more encouraging.</s> <s i="14">But here and there they may be more realistic.</s> <s i="15">One is for Israel to talk directly to Hamas.</s> <s i="16">At the diplomatic level this is a non-starter because Hamas does not appear interested in discussing substantive issues with Israel, and in any case contact with it would further weaken the more moderate Fateh leadership.</s> <s i="17">At the security level, however, these contacts make sense if the objective is a stable ceasefire and the inevitable prisoner swap for Gilad Shalit.</s> 

<s i="18">But we are also witnessing a worrisome armed buildup in Gaza under the tutelage of Iran and Hizballah.</s> <s i="19">In Damascus, the Hamas leadership is fomenting new suicide bombings against Israel as well as attacks on Fateh, all aimed at derailing current peace efforts.</s> <s i="20">Sooner or later these activities will lead to a major new outbreak of fighting between Israel and Hamas.</s> <s i="21">Here it is tempting to contemplate an Israeli military success in eliminating the Hamas leadership and infrastructure.</s> <s i="22">Yet we know from experience that both long-term occupation of the Strip and any attempt to install a more friendly (Fateh?) Palestinian regime in Gaza are potentially counter-productive enterprises that Israel should avoid like the plague.</s>

<s i="23">An indirect approach to the Fateh-Hamas clash of forces in the Palestinian arena would be for Israel to more energetically seek a negotiating track with Syria.</s> <s i="24">This would both maintain overall peace process momentum and present the possibility of weakening Hamas by persuading Syria to reduce its support for that organization.</s> <s i="25">This would also mean inviting Syria to President Bush's peace meeting scheduled for November, thereby increasing the meeting's prospects for success.</s> <s i="26">While the chances for a successful peace process with Syria are probably less than 50 percent, under current circumstances they are still higher than the likelihood of a successful Israeli-Palestinian peace process.</s>

<s i="27">Finally, we must bear in mind that our Arab neighbors, and particularly Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are so disappointed with Fateh and anxious to mitigate extremist influences on Hamas that they are trying to promote renewed Fateh-Hamas dialogue and possibly shared government.</s> <s i="28">If Abbas continues to fail in his leadership role and/or if, as is likely, the Washington meeting fails, this is where he will look.</s> <s i="29">And this, in turn, could well constitute a prelude to a Hamas takeover of the West Bank.</s>
