<s i="0">It is not clear whether Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' recent call for &quot;national and comprehensive dialogue&quot; with Hamas is a significant change of position.</s> <s i="1">Some PA leaders claim that the Hamas coup in Gaza must be reversed before talks can begin, others that such &quot;political conditions&quot; have been dropped.</s> 

<s i="2">What is clear is that following the ups and downs of the Hamas-Fateh relationship is a somewhat pointless exercise, since what is most important is not declarations and even talks but the power balance that underlies them.</s>

<s i="3">For example, let's say that Hamas and Fateh were able to reach a modus vivendi and in some way join forces.</s> <s i="4">Would the missile attacks from Gaza on Israel continue?</s> <s i="5">Would this joint Palestinian entity meet the Quartet conditions regarding recognition of Israel and ending support for terrorism?</s> 

<s i="6">The answer to these questions will be a function not of the formal relationship between warring Palestinian entities but rather of which broad camp--the Islamists in Hamas and Hizballah or the &quot;nationalists&quot; in Fateh--has the upper hand.</s> <s i="7">This, in turn, will be most likely determined by forces arrayed in concentric circles outside the Palestinian-Israeli arena.</s>

<s i="8">The first of these circles is the Arab world.</s> <s i="9">If the Arab states, principally Egypt, are exerting increased pressure on Hamas--perhaps by ending the flow of weapons across the Egyptian-Gaza border--then Fateh might be willing and able to tip the Palestinian balance toward negotiations rather than aggression.</s> <s i="10">But what determines the stance of the Arab states?</s> 

<s i="11">At Annapolis and since, we have seen that the Arab states are not happy about the rise of Iranian power and are willing to make gestures toward an American-led peace process.</s> <s i="12">At the same time, these states will not, despite limited American urging to do so, significantly advance this process by setting an example and taking concrete steps toward Israel.</s> 

<s i="13">Egypt's ambivalent position is typical in this regard.</s> <s i="14">Aside from attending Yitzhak Rabin's funeral, President Hosni Mubarak has never visited Israel.</s> <s i="15">Egypt could greatly reduce or end the weapons flow into Gaza but does not.</s> <s i="16">And Egypt is not above pushing for Hamas-Fateh reconciliation on terms that would not meet the Quartet's conditions and would represent a defeat for the pro-negotiations Palestinian camp.</s> 

<s i="17">All of this is a function partly of the historic Arab preference for a process over peace itself.</s> <s i="18">But at this time it is even more related to uncertainty regarding the surrounding concentric circle, that of the struggle between Iran and the West.</s> 

<s i="19">So long as the Arab states see an approaching Iranian nuclear shadow on the horizon, they will not grant the West a victory that they have fought and resisted for the past century: ending the war to destroy the Jewish state.</s> <s i="20">The same goes for the Palestinians, whether in Hamas or Fateh.</s> 

<s i="21">Rather than attempting to read Palestinian tea leaves, anyone who cares about the prospects for Israeli-Palestinian peace should be looking to European capitals, to the US election in November and perhaps also to the leadership crisis in Israel.</s> <s i="22">If the current too-little-too-late approach toward Iran continues, everyone knows that Iran will get the bomb, radical forces in the region will automatically be strengthened and current peace efforts will fail--among many other negative consequences for the region and the world.</s> 

<s i="23">Fortunately, there is also no doubt that the situation can be changed given a modicum of willingness in the West to act upon its values and interests.</s> <s i="24">While less than one percent of Europe's trade is with Iran, 40 percent of Iran's trade is with Europe.</s> <s i="25">The Iranian regime is unpopular and vulnerable to determined economic and diplomatic isolation and, as a last resort, its nuclear program is vulnerable to military measures.</s> 

<s i="26">Dealing with Iran may seem like a round-about way to address an Israeli-Palestinian impasse, but the refusal to see the Iranian angle actually reveals other blinders.</s> <s i="27">Granting radical Islamism a nuclear umbrella would not just end any prospects for Arab-Israeli peace but would launch a regional nuclear arms race, jack up the price of oil, spell doom for moderate Lebanese, Iraqis and Palestinians, presage attempts to destabilize Arab regimes and invite a new rash of terrorism in western countries.</s>
