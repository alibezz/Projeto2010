<s i="0">The separation fence is today at the center of public debate.</s> <s i="1">Ultimately it will constitute a 
physical barrier between us and the Palestinians.</s> <s i="2">Many people are in favor of its construction.</s> <s i="3">The 
terrorist acts of recent years inside the green line generated an understanding among ourselves and 
the Palestinians that even if the two peoples are destined one day to live peacefully side by side--for the present they have to separate.</s> 

<s i="4">The debate that produces almost daily protests, demonstrations, disturbances, violent attacks, and 
appeals to the High Court of Justice is not about the necessity for the barrier--but rather its 
location.</s> <s i="5">In many instances the barrier creates gross injustices and humanitarian and economic 
problems.</s> <s i="6">It separates people from their land and source of income, families from their communities, 
students from their institutions of learning, the ill from their physicians, entire populations from 
the center of their lives.</s> <s i="7">But when we speak of the barrier in Jerusalem, what is called the 
Jerusalem envelope, we encounter all these dilemmas and something else: stupidity.</s> 

<s i="8">In June 1967, shortly after the Six-Day War, the Government of Israel decided to expand the borders 
of Jerusalem.</s> <s i="9">A small city encompassing 38 square kilometers all told became a large metropolis of 
108 sq. km.</s> <s i="10">Overnight Jerusalem became the biggest city in Israel in terms of both expanse and 
population.</s> 

<s i="11">Then in the early 1970s, the government added two important decisions.</s> <s i="12">One was to build new 
neighborhoods in the annexed parts of the city and encourage Jews from around the country and the 
world to establish their homes there.</s> <s i="13">The second was a directive to municipal planners to design 
their long-term plans so as to maintain the 1967 demographic ratio within the city of 74.2 percent 
Jews and 25.8 percent Arabs (figures from the Jerusalem Institute of Israel Studies).</s> <s i="14">This directive 
constituted a green light for the planning and building authorities, Jerusalem Municipality, and 
Ministry of Interior to limit construction plans for Jerusalem Arabs and to reduce, to the greatest 
extent possible, the areas allotted for building.</s> 

<s i="15">One of the default options left open to Jerusalem Arabs was to build their homes outside the new 
city limits, but close enough so that Jerusalem would continue to constitute the center of their 
lives.</s> <s i="16">Thousands of Palestinian families were pushed toward this option and built their homes 
outside the city limits, but only a few minutesï¿½ drive from its center.</s> <s i="17">Indeed the Ministry of 
Housing, in close cooperation with the Jerusalem Municipality and with the aid of mortgages from the 
Bank of Jerusalem, offered Jerusalem Arabs an additional incentive--an offer they could not refuse: 
buy a new home in al Azaria next to Jerusalem and enhance your standard of living.</s>

<s i="18">Jerusalem Arabs who seized this opportunity were reassured by the Ministry and the Municipality that 
none of their privileges as residents of the State of Israel--social security allowances, health 
insurance, Israeli ID, etc.--would in any way be curtailed.</s> <s i="19">So successful was the scheme that a 
second, &quot;build your own house&quot; phase was declared in al Azaria.</s> <s i="20">Once again the issue of residents' 
rights was raised, and once again assurances were provided that all residency privileges would be 
maintained.</s> <s i="21">So again many hurried to exploit the mortgage bargains being offered by the bank, 
purchased lots, and built new homes.</s> 

<s i="22">To this day, thousands of Palestinian families have left Jerusalem in this way at their own 
initiative.</s> <s i="23">To a large extent, the Israeli authorities have remained faithful to their commitment 
not to detract from the rights of East Jerusalem Arabs who moved their dwellings to parts of the 
West Bank adjacent to Jerusalem, even though according to the letter of the law, these families 
(residents but not citizens of Israel, whose lives still focus on Jerusalem) have left Israel and no 
longer enjoy the same privileges as the rest of Israel's residents.</s>

<s i="24">Here we come to the separation fence.</s> <s i="25">The barrier, currently being constructed energetically, will 
create a sad new reality.</s> <s i="26">Thousands of Palestinian families whose lives center on Jerusalem but who 
built homes beyond the municipal borders will now find themselves cut off from the city.</s> <s i="27">The 
merchant whose business is in East Jerusalem, the clerk or social worker employed by the 
Municipality, the children who study at schools run by the Municipality and Ministry of Education, 
the employee of a Jerusalem Arab or Jewish business--all are Jerusalem residents, all continue to 
pay their taxes and social security charges to the Israeli authorities and to receive social 
security pensions, and all will discover that they have in effect left Jerusalem permanently and are 
completely cut off from the center of their lives.</s>

<s i="28">Thus far the injustice.</s> <s i="29">Where is the stupidity?</s> <s i="30">We have noted that the government of Israel wanted 
to preserve the same demographic ratio between Jews and Arabs as in 1967 and instructed its planners 
accordingly.</s> <s i="31">Now, as a consequence of the physical barrier going up between Jerusalem and the 
adjacent West Bank neighborhoods, thousands of Palestinian families that live outside the city in 
nearby suburbs are beginning to return to the city.</s> <s i="32">Since Jerusalem cannot satisfy all their housing 
needs, they will live in poor and crowded conditions--so long as they can live in Jerusalem.</s> 

<s i="33">And what has happened to the demographic ratio?</s> <s i="34">The Israeli government's dream of maintaining the 
1967 proportion between Jews and Arabs is no longer valid.</s> <s i="35">The ratio is changing.</s> <s i="36">The government, 
which wanted a solid Jewish majority in the city, is liable to wake up to a very different reality.</s>
