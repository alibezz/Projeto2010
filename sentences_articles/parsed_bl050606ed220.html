<s i="0">Israel's big neighbor, Egypt, is not an easy peace partner.</s> <s i="1">It is the most populous and powerful Arab country, with 7,000 years of stability behind it, and aspirations to &quot;advise&quot; the rest of the Arabs and Israel how and when to deal with one another.</s> <s i="2">During the heady days of the Oslo process in the mid-1990s, Cairo occasionally torpedoed promising Israeli peace initiatives in Africa and the Arab world because it did not deem Jerusalem sufficiently deserving.</s> <s i="3">President Hosni Mubarak avoids visiting Israel--Israeli leaders considered worthy of the honor are invited to make pilgrimages to him.</s> <s i="4">Indeed, Egyptians in general are discouraged from visiting Israel.</s> 

<s i="5">On the other hand, the Egyptians were the first to make peace with Israel, and they have kept the peace.</s> <s i="6">They helped with the disengagement from Gaza.</s> <s i="7">They are interested in expanding advantageous economic ties with Israel in the American-sponsored Qualified Industrial Zones.</s> <s i="8">And they seek to advance Israeli-Palestinian peace, albeit on their own terms.</s>

<s i="9">In short, an Israeli prime minister seeking to promote a new initiative vis-a-vis the Palestinians would be well advised to consult with the Egyptians first.</s> <s i="10">In this sense, Israeli PM Ehud Olmert probably should have met with Mubarak before going to Washington last month, not after.</s> <s i="11">Nevertheless, and despite the death of two Egyptian soldiers in a clash with the IDF in an unfortunate incident along the border a few days earlier, Olmert was warmly welcomed at a brief summit in Sharm al-Sheikh on June 4.</s> 

<s i="12">Olmert seemingly said all the right things and more.</s> <s i="13">His public praise for Mubarak at a press conference was almost embarrassingly effusive.</s> <s i="14">At least for public consumption, Olmert bowed to Mubarak's will and agreed to concentrate on negotiating with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for the next few months, postponing even talk of another Israeli unilateral disengagement for a later day.</s> 

<s i="15">The script was suspiciously similar to Olmert's Washington visit a couple of weeks ago, where the Israeli prime minister heaped mountains of public praise on President George W. Bush.</s> <s i="16">Indeed, the only difference between the public aspects of the Olmert summit with Mubarak and the Olmert summit with Bush was that Bush at least called Olmert's &quot;realignment&quot; plan &quot;bold ideas&quot;; Mubarak referred to it as &quot;a different solution&quot;.</s> 

<s i="17">Olmert has hopefully drawn some lessons from these two summits.</s> <s i="18">Even if we assume that Bush and Mubarak, in private, are completely supportive of realignment, Olmert's plan for unilateral Israeli withdrawal on the West Bank has nevertheless not been marketed well, and this has dictated quick (but elegant) retreats in his contacts with world and regional leaders.</s> <s i="19">Since those contacts are going to continue in the coming weeks, a few adjustments in the presentation of the plan to keep it in tune with realities on the ground and the limits of feasibility appear to be in order.</s> <s i="20">Otherwise, assuming (as Olmert does, justifiably) that the projected negotiations with Abbas fail, Olmert will be hard put to gain overt international and regional backing for realignment when he really needs it.</s>

<s i="21">First and most important, the realignment is not a &quot;solution&quot;.</s> <s i="22">It falls within the realm of conflict management, not conflict resolution.</s> <s i="23">It is a fall-back step to be invoked in order to protect Israel's demographic and physical security interests, maintain momentum and keep the option of a two-state solution alive at a time when negotiations are either impossible or pointless.</s> <s i="24">Israel is not dictating final status lines or creating a political fait accompli.</s>

<s i="25">Accordingly, the fence line that Israel withdraws to is not a border, but a temporary line of defense.</s> <s i="26">If it embraces settlement blocs across the green line, they are still up for negotiation if and when a viable, moderate and authoritative Palestinian leader emerges.</s> <s i="27">So is the Jordan Valley, which Israel will also hold for temporary security purposes.</s> <s i="28">Speaking of security, Olmert must have the courage and political wisdom to reroute the fence/wall in Jerusalem so as to protect Jewish neighborhoods from Palestinian suicide bombers, not separate Palestinians from one another.</s>
