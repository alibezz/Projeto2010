<s i="0">When the term &quot;ceasefire&quot; is mentioned on the Palestinian street, everybody starts either making fun of it or they list the Israeli aggressions and killings of Palestinian civilians, the last of which was the Gaza seashore massacre where a whole family, except one daughter, Huda Ghalia, was killed while picnicking on the beach.</s> <s i="1">All Israeli actions in occupied Palestinian territory, such as the construction of the wall, the flying checkpoints, house demolitions, etc., are understood as acts of aggression.</s> 

<s i="2">But another dimension to the ceasefire lies in its origins in the Cairo Declaration of March 2005, when Hamas agreed to some kind of unilateral ceasefire with Israel until the end of 2005.</s> <s i="3">Hamas lived up to its promise and showed on several occasions remarkable self-restraint.</s> <s i="4">In fact, the ceasefire was part of a deal agreed between Hamas and President Mahmoud Abbas, who also lived up to his part of the bargain and held legislative elections in which Hamas won a majority and was presented with the chance to form a government at the beginning of 2006.</s> 

<s i="5">Trying to walk a thin line between resistance and government, Hamas kept up its rhetoric and rejected recognizing Israel and attaining international legitimacy but also refrained from executing any operation.</s> <s i="6">The movement didn't want to give Israel any excuse to target its leaders, something that could cause the collapse of the government.</s> <s i="7">Nevertheless, Israel continued its incursions, arrests and killings and Hamas' tactical extension of the ceasefire didn't stop either the concerted external or internal campaigns against it.</s>

<s i="8">Now, after three months, almost no salaries have been paid to more than 160,000 PA employees, the rate of poverty is increasing and there is a shortage of medicine due to the international embargo.</s> <s i="9">President Abbas has seized the initiative to send Hamas a message that this current situation cannot continue and there is a need for a courageous decision.</s> <s i="10">The referendum on the prisoners' &quot;national conciliation&quot; document was his answer.</s> 

<s i="11">According to recent Palestinian public opinion polls, that referendum will be supported by at least 60 percent of voters.</s> <s i="12">If true, that would force Hamas to either accept the people's will and join President Abbas' political program or step down.</s> 

<s i="13">Hamas' options to overcome the current crisis and dilemma are very limited, but the most logical option is to end the ceasefire and resume military operations against Israel.</s> <s i="14">Any such escalation would make the referendum almost impossible to organize.</s> <s i="15">Hamas has also been stung by Fateh criticism that the Islamic Resistance Movement promised change, reform and continued resistance, and none has so far happened.</s>

<s i="16">Internationally, no one has wanted Hamas as a political partner.</s> <s i="17">Before the PLC elections, western, Arab and Palestinian diplomats used to talk about the need to push Hamas to the political arena.</s> <s i="18">But when Hamas entered the political stage, no one was ready to talk to them.</s> <s i="19">Instead, everyone seemed to have been planning to get Hamas into politics simply so it would give up resistance.</s> <s i="20">No one expected the overwhelming victory, and the only contingency plan was to punish ordinary Palestinians for their democratic choice.</s>

<s i="21">Hamas' interest now lies in ending the ceasefire.</s> <s i="22">This also serves the purpose of Israel, which wants a military movement and not a political movement.</s> <s i="23">Both Hamas and Israel will gain from an end to the ceasefire, but the losers will be innocent civilians on both sides.</s>
