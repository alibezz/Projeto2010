<s i="0">The Bush administration's approach toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has gone through a number of permutations.</s> <s i="1">Upon taking office in 2001, the new American president indicated that he did not intend to get deeply involved in peacemaking between Arabs and Israelis.</s> <s i="2">His predecessor, Bill Clinton, had failed at this seemingly hopeless task, and in so doing wasted valuable American diplomatic energies and prestige.</s> <s i="3">Bush received the Mitchell Report, sent Secretary of State Powell and special envoy Anthony Zinni several times to the region, but avoided any serious American initiative.</s> <s i="4">Under pressure from the Arab world and the international community, the administration agreed to participate in the efforts of the Quartet (the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia) to generate a new peace plan, but with little enthusiasm.</s>

<s i="5">This chronology was punctuated at an early stage by the events of September 11, 2001.</s> <s i="6">US post-9/11 policies, by emphasizing a preemptive, aggressive, zero-tolerance attitude toward terrorism emanating from the Middle East, tended quite naturally to favor Israel's position against that of the Palestinian leadership.</s> <s i="7">Ultimately this developed into the demand that the Palestinians remove Yasser Arafat from effective power and elect an alternative leadership as a precondition for American involvement.</s> <s i="8">But at the same time, Bush became the first American president to officially endorse a two-state solution, and his June 24, 2002 speech, which became a bedrock of his policy, appears to endorse the 1967 lines as the basis for such an outcome.</s>  

<s i="9">All the while, Bush could not ignore the role of two important electoral constituencies--part of the organized American Jewish community, and the evangelical Christian right--in supporting Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's positions vis-&amp;agrave;-vis the Palestinians.</s>

<s i="10">The administration's policy seemingly changed on the eve of the invasion and occupation of Iraq, when Bush, after months of delay, endorsed the Quartet's roadmap.</s> <s i="11">He thereby accepted a policy position that required immediate concessions from Israel with regard to settlements and the occupation--concessions that the president had hitherto sought to postpone to a more advanced stage of the process, after the Palestinians had chosen a new leader and ended terrorism.</s>

<s i="12">The roadmap timeline--Bush's enthusiastic pre-war endorsement of the document in March 2003, pressure to appoint a new Palestinian prime minister (winter-spring 2003), and a high profile post-war ceremonial launching (June 2003)--points to the war in Iraq as a major American strategic consideration in calibrating the timing and degree of US commitment.</s>

<s i="13">Here the guiding American policy principle appears to have been that if the US was seen to be sincerely trying to end the violence and restore the peace process, this would help it prior to the war in Iraq in recruiting allies and blunting opposition in Europe and the Arab world.</s> <s i="14">Once the war was over, a successful roadmap process would ensure the ongoing goodwill of Iraq's neighbors, just as success in democratizing Iraq would redound positively on the Israeli-Palestinian arena, in keeping with the much talked about positive domino effect.</s>

<s i="15">In this sense, the subsequent post-war decline in American efforts to facilitate the roadmap mainly reflects the administration's growing sense of distress in Iraq, along with the constraints of US presidential elections in late 2004.</s> <s i="16">With all due respect to Bush's religious fervor in presenting his roadmap process to Arab leaders (&quot;I'm on a mission from God&quot;), it was old-fashioned considerations of realpolitik that took over when the going got rough.</s> <s i="17">The needs of Bush's potential voters took primacy: the administration reverted to a conflict-management mode; it ceased to enforce its own peace plan.</s>
 
<s i="18">How then, do we explain the current flurry of US criticism and pressures on Israel?</s> <s i="19">President Bush has publicly called for Israel to dismantle outposts, cease expanding settlements and reroute the fence.</s> <s i="20">The US supported the Russian initiative for the UN Security Council to endorse the roadmap.</s> <s i="21">It has deducted nearly $300 million from loan guarantees as a penalty for Israeli investments in the settlements and the fence.</s> <s i="22">And Secretary of State Colin Powell and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz have spoken approvingly of informal Palestinian-Israeli peace initiatives.</s>

<s i="23">One explanation is Sharon's mistakes and failings.</s> <s i="24">The administration was reportedly livid over his transparent attempts to &quot;legalize&quot; outposts so that roadmap demands no longer apply to them.</s> <s i="25">It is shocked by the deal he's intent on doing, with the help of &quot;old Europe&quot;</s> <s i="26">(Germany), with Hizballah, a major terrorist enemy.</s> <s i="27">And it is keenly aware of growing criticism of the prime minister by senior serving and former Israeli security officials and by the Israeli public.</s>

<s i="28">A second is the administration's apparent determination that, despite election year considerations, it cannot afford to allow Israel to ignore the &quot;red lines&quot; it has laid down over recent months concerning settlements and cooperation with new Palestinian governments.</s> <s i="29">It is serving notice that, precisely because it wants relative peace and quiet in the Israeli-Palestinian sector for the coming election year, Sharon should not take it for granted, and Israel has to accept certain restrictions on its initiatives.</s>

<s i="30">At the end of the day, this is in no way a crisis in US-Israel relations--something neither side wants.</s> <s i="31">What the administration appears to seek for the coming year is a relatively low profile for our conflict, meaning no provocations from either side--even if the roadmap process is not advanced.</s> 

<s i="32">Sharon's response--a PR flurry of ambiguous hints of new initiatives, bilateral and unilateral--and the solidification of Yasser Arafat's power as supreme Palestinian leader, both appear to indicate that neither side has yet developed a realistic strategy for peace.</s> <s i="33">Under these circumstances, only an energetic American commitment will make a difference.</s> <s i="34">And that is not about to happen.</s>
