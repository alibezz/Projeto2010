<s i="0">Since 1967, an estimated 650,000 Palestinians have at one time or another been imprisoned by Israel.</s> <s i="1">Every day Israeli troops and Israel's Border Police add to that number, often by the dozen.</s> <s i="2">More than 3,000 Palestinians were arrested this year alone, and double that number was arrested after the Israeli army reoccupied populated areas of the West Bank in 2002.</s> <s i="3">Their &quot;crime&quot; is to fight the occupation.</s> 
  
<s i="4">Some 10,000 Palestinian prisoners now languish in Israel's notorious &quot;security prisons&quot;, including 380 children under the age of 18 and 115 women.</s> <s i="5">Many of those prisoners are sick and suffer from chronic diseases.</s> <s i="6">Many of them are old and have spent more than 20 years in jail.</s> <s i="7">Many are leaders of various Palestinian factions and groups who directed the struggle against the Israeli occupation and paved the road for Palestinian national reconciliation.</s> <s i="8">Marwan Barghouti (Fateh), Ahmed Sadaat (PFLP), Abdul Khaleq Natsheh (Hamas) and others crafted the Prisoners' Document, which became a unifying document for all the factions predicated on a political settlement with Israel based on the two-state solution.</s> 
  
<s i="9">When the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel signed the Oslo Accords in September 1993, this was not, as it should have been, followed by a comprehensive release of Palestinian prisoners.</s> <s i="10">The agony and suffering of these long-term prisoners and their families are an open wound in Palestinian society.</s> <s i="11">Indeed, it is a source of friction and the children and relatives of Palestinian prisoners have regularly protested against a Palestinian leadership that has failed so far to secure their release.</s> <s i="12">Thus the capture of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas and other groups offered them new hope.</s> 
  
<s i="13">Over the past two weeks, the children of Palestinian prisoners have called for the release of their parents in return for the release of the Israeli kidnapped soldier.</s> <s i="14">They also appealed directly to Aviva Shalit, the mother of the Israeli soldier, to understand their grief and suffering.</s> <s i="15">Said one: &quot;we know how eager you are to have your son back, to know anything about him and this is your right.</s> <s i="16">But could you stop for a moment and think of the thousands of Palestinians in your jails?&quot;</s>
  
<s i="17">The capture of Shalit has focused attention on a problem that the Israeli government and people need to find serious solutions to.</s> <s i="18">In the past, Israel has released Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli soldiers abducted by Palestinian groups or Hizballah in Lebanon.</s> <s i="19">But the PLO has had little success with negotiations over prisoners.</s> <s i="20">Instead, releases to the PLO were usually presented as &quot;goodwill gestures&quot;.</s> <s i="21">But such gestures, the last in 2003 when Mahmoud Abbas was prime minister, never dealt with the long-term prisoners.</s> 
  
<s i="22">Israeli choices this time are very limited.</s> <s i="23">The best course of action would be an exchange.</s> <s i="24">It seems that the security establishment in Israel is ready to release Palestinian prisoners &quot;with no Jewish blood on their hands&quot;.</s> <s i="25">The number of prisoners released seems less important to Israel than the kind of prisoners.</s> <s i="26">But it will be unacceptable if a repeat of the actions of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu--who freed ordinary criminals to fulfill his part of the Wye River Memorandum--is considered.</s> <s i="27">A further problem facing the Israeli government now, is that the more concessions they give in return for the captured soldier the more it will strengthen Hamas and weaken moderates in Palestinian society.</s>
