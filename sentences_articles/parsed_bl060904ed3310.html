<s i="0">Hunger strikes by terrorist prisoners in the facilities of the Israel Prison Service are a periodic ritual, repeated every few years when prisoners judge the circumstances to be ripe.</s> <s i="1">Let me note at the outset that the state of individual rights and the prison conditions of security prisoners and detainees in these facilities are very good in comparison with any parallel population of terrorists or terror suspects in the world, and particularly in the West.</s> <s i="2">Witness, for example, the conditions of prisoners held by the United States in Guantanamo and in Abu Ghraib and other prisons in Iraq.</s> <s i="3">This judgment is reflected in the human rights report disseminated by the US State Department for 2003: &quot;In general, conditions in the Israel Prison Service's facilities accord with international standards&quot;.</s>

<s i="4">In the course of the past two and a half years there has been a steady erosion of &quot;benefits&quot;, i.e., additional privileges not mandated by law, by international convention or by orders--the kind awarded to prisoners as a humanitarian gesture and on condition that they do not contravene state or prison security rules.</s> <s i="5">This erosion was a direct consequence of the violation of these conditions by the prisoners, including the planning and directing of terrorist attacks from jail, attacking and wounding of prison staff, attempting escape, and smuggling of forbidden goods into prison.</s> <s i="6">Among the prisoners are dozens of suicide bombers who failed to carry out their mission, and who have no inhibitions about carrying out a suicide mission aimed at as many representatives of the &quot;enemy&quot; as possible.</s>

<s i="7">Until recently, despite this dynamic, the prisoners had not reacted in an organized manner.</s> <s i="8">They well understood that every privilege denied them and that degraded their living conditions, was a direct reciprocal consequence of the disobeying of orders and violation of security.</s> <s i="9">Thus, the smuggling of a cellular phone in a baby's diaper ended unrestricted meetings and physical contact with children at the close of family visits, while the smuggling of a phone in the genital area led to a renewal of strip searches of both prisoners and visitors.</s> 

<s i="10">The prisoners eventually announced their intention to strike, ostensibly in protest at this erosion in conditions, even though in the course of the past year no further deterioration had taken place, with the exception of glass barriers replacing screens at family visits--this, too, due to the smuggling of goods and messages, including instructions for terrorist acts.</s> <s i="11">The real circumstances for the strike were, in my assessment, as follows:

For one, internal dynamics within the Palestinian Authority were at play: the prisoners' sensed that the public had forgotten them; there was rivalry among factions that had senior representatives jockeying for leadership in jail; and the strike was an opportunity for the Palestinian leadership to divert public opinion from domestic anarchy.</s>

<s i="12">Secondly, the decision to strike was affected by political issues, including the anticipated unilateral Israeli disengagement without negotiations, the ongoing difficulty in carrying out acts of hard terrorism (punctuated by the Beersheva attack, some two and a half weeks into the strike), the recognition that the near future holds no likely prisoner release, and the hope placed on Hizballah as the only possible vehicle for release.</s>

<s i="13">At the bureaucratic level of the Prison Service and the Ministry for Public Security, the arrival of a new prisons commissioner a year ago and a policy review led the prisoner leadership to assess the time was ripe for a confrontation with the sovereign power.</s> 

<s i="14">Finally, at the international level, there was an attempt to ride the &quot;wave&quot; created by the recommendation of the International Court of Justice at The Hague regarding the security fence and the related declaration of the United Nations, in order to generate pressure on Israel as a violator of the rights of both civilians and &quot;freedom fighters&quot; and to de-legitimize steps it takes against terrorism in the territories and the prisons.</s>

<s i="15">But in the case at hand, the calculations of both the security prisoners and the Prison Service appear to have been lacking.</s>

<s i="16">The extremist prisoner leadership miscalculated the likelihood of influencing public opinion in Israel, the territories and the world.</s> <s i="17">Around the globe, attention was focused on the Olympic Games.</s> <s i="18">The brutal suicide bombings in Beersheva eliminated any residual chance to hold the world's interest.</s> <s i="19">Moreover, the prisoners thought they could hold a &quot;deluxe&quot; strike and continue to drink nourishing liquids like milk, soup and juice and receive other additives like salt.</s> <s i="20">But the Prison Service rejected this request and left them with water alone, to the point where some strikers abandoned the strike on their own, while others were eventually given liquids and additives on doctors' orders.</s>

<s i="21">The Prison Service publicized the strike long before it began, thereby generating a momentum that obliged the prisoners to strike even if their heart was not in it.</s> <s i="22">At this stage there was even talk of possible negotiations over some of the prisoners' &quot;demands&quot;, thereby energizing the strike yet further.</s> <s i="23">This added an additional factor of confusion: demands with regard to rules and conditions are within the sole authority of the sovereign, i.e., the state by means of the Prison Service, while prisoners can only request improved conditions.</s> <s i="24">This is not a negotiating situation between, say, the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</s> <s i="25">Moreover, the strike could have been &quot;broken&quot; before it began by providing the extra liquids and additives and publishing the fact that in reality there is no strike at all, thereby neutralizing public and international interest.</s>

<s i="26">Under these circumstances it appears that neither the sovereign nor the prisoners gained much from the strike.</s> <s i="27">This was one more round that ended in stalemate, part of a long war that is waged behind bars as well as beyond.</s> <s i="28">The prisoners, the PA leadership and the sovereign all knew that we would not concede one iota of security, and that no substantive change in prison conditions was possible as long as terrorists continue their struggle and exploit every opening to attack.</s>
