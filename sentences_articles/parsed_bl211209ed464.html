<s i="0">The triangular American-Israeli-Palestinian relationship is fundamentally asymmetrical.</s> <s i="1">Israel is a close ally and enjoys a &quot;special relationship&quot; with the US based on shared values, a strong domestic constituency and an historic American commitment to her security and well-being.</s> <s i="2">Over the decades, Israel has enjoyed broad bipartisan support; small fluctuations notwithstanding, some 60 percent of Americans have consistently been pro-Israel, while only some five percent favor the Palestinians (the remainder have no opinion).</s> 

<s i="3">Nevertheless, we are at a turning point in US-Israel relations.</s> <s i="4">The cool wind blowing from Washington since President Barack Obama entered office is not an aberration, a fleeting period of an unfriendly president, but a possible sign of things to come.</s> <s i="5">While overall support for Israel remains robust, Israel has largely lost the support of liberal America and more and more people simply no longer understand or sympathize with her.</s> <s i="6">A &quot;Europeanization&quot; of American opinion is taking place wherein Israel is increasingly viewed as the aggressor and obstacle to peace.</s> <s i="7">For this reason alone, the &quot;special relationship&quot; is under significant strain.</s>

<s i="8">It is further undermined by long-term trends in American society.</s> <s i="9">Although the alienation of the liberal community and assimilation among Jews have been underway for decades, these processes have peaked.</s> <s i="10">Israel-bashing is now the cause celebre among the young and liberal and is making inroads among conservatives as well.</s> <s i="11">One can dirty the waters of a well for just so long and we are at that point now.</s> <s i="12">Future administrations may be friendlier than the current one and Obama himself is not anti-Israel, but we can no longer count on this: the US-Israel relationship appears to have peaked.</s> 

<s i="13">Some have concluded that PM Binyamin Netanyahu &quot;got the better&quot; of Obama in recent months, circumventing his demands for concessions and in effect &quot;teaching him a lesson&quot;.</s> <s i="14">In the short term he did, indeed, deflect Obama's demands and the administration appears to have gained a more realistic understanding of what can be achieved, based on its experience both with Netanyahu and the Palestinians.</s>

<s i="15">Nothing, however, would be more dangerous than the belief that Netanyahu &quot;won&quot;.</s> <s i="16">American presidents do not like to be &quot;taught lessons&quot;, certainly not by almost totally dependent client states.</s> <s i="17">Sooner or later, Obama will show who is truly in charge.</s> <s i="18">Although Netanyahu is said to think &quot;American&quot;--he certainly has the accent--his actions threaten to undermine relations with the United States, one of the fundamental pillars of Israel's national security.</s> <s i="19">His grudging concessions to the US (recognition of the two-state solution and temporary settlement freeze) have prevented a crisis so far, but a showdown is likely.</s> <s i="20">At that time, Israel's dependence on the US will manifest itself, especially in light of the Iranian issue.</s>

<s i="21">For the Palestinians, the US is the great &quot;balancer&quot; in the fundamental asymmetry between them and Israel.</s> <s i="22">They are fully cognizant of the nature of the US-Israel relationship.</s> <s i="23">Yet the American role in the peace process and support for at least some Palestinian positions greatly offset Israel's otherwise overwhelming strength.</s> <s i="24">The Palestinians may be closer in outlook to Europe and enjoy widespread international support, but only the US can &quot;deliver Israel&quot; and provide what they seek, an independent state.</s> 
 
<s i="25">Most Americans do not have an instinctive sense of identification with the Palestinians and are repelled by their terrorism, radicalism, corruption and dysfunctionality.</s> <s i="26">Nevertheless, the Palestinian narrative of the origins of the conflict and the means of resolving it is capturing American public opinion.</s> <s i="27">If only Israel would end settlements and the occupation and agree to a Palestinian state, Americans increasingly believe, all would be right.</s> 

<s i="28">The Palestinians, however, also risk the dangers of complacency in their relations with the US.</s> <s i="29">The Obama administration will presumably continue its efforts to promote the peace process for the foreseeable future, but ongoing Palestinian intransigence and dysfunctionality may lead the administration to a Bush-style conclusion that the traction simply is not there for significant American involvement.</s> <s i="30">Indeed, US involvement has already lost steam--witness the demise of the Mitchell mission.</s> <s i="31">The ongoing separation between the West Bank and Hamas-ruled Gaza coupled with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' combination of rejectionism (Olmert's generous offer) and tenuous leadership are taking their toll as well.</s>
