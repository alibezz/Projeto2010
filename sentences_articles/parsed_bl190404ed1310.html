<s i="0">Since September 2000 the Palestinians have waged a war against Israel in violation of their 1993 commitments to give up terror.</s> <s i="1">Even a minimalist interpretation of the Palestinian goals, in contrast to the credible assertion that the Palestinian body politic still favors the destruction of the Jewish state, shows rather meager results for the campaign.</s> <s i="2">After more than three years of terror, the Palestinians are not one inch closer to the establishment of a Palestinian state.</s> <s i="3">As a matter of fact, much of the infrastructure for such a state was gradually destroyed in the armed struggle, leaving the Palestinian Authority in shambles.</s> <s i="4">While important Palestinian systems, such as education and health, still continue to function, other vital services have drastically deteriorated, most notably public order and the dispensation of justice, eroding public trust in the nascent Palestinian entity.</s> 

<s i="5">This entity has gradually turned into a fragmented society run by thugs and local warlords.</s> <s i="6">The international community increasingly views the Palestinians as unable to govern themselves successfully.</s> <s i="7">Even their supporters are airing proposals for an international trusteeship--an unlikely scenario--to help the Palestinians in their transition to statehood.</s>

<s i="8">In contrast, Israel has succeeded in denying Palestinian goals and was successful in overcoming the international constraints on its freedom of military action against targets in Palestinian-ruled territories, thereby denying the Palestinian terrorists safe sanctuaries.</s> <s i="9">Since Operation Defensive Shield (March-April 2002) the terrorists, primarily in the West Bank, are on the run.</s> <s i="10">While some aspects of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operations still meet with international criticism, there is much greater understanding for the Israeli need to carry out offensive actions in self-defense against terrorism.</s> <s i="11">Israel�s record in this respect, the foiling of over 90 percent of suicide bomber attacks, is remarkable.</s>

<s i="12">Undoubtedly, 9/11 was a turning point in the Israeli-Palestinian war.</s> <s i="13">This event sensitized much of the world, particularly the US, to the Israeli dilemmas in fighting terrorism.</s> <s i="14">In contrast, the Palestinian leadership was hardly cognizant of the 9/11 effects and failed to change gear by distancing the Palestinian struggle from terror.</s> <s i="15">While the suicide attacks constituted a serious security challenge to Israel, the indiscriminate killings of civilians were clearly not perceived by the international community as a legitimate act of resistance.</s> <s i="16">The suicide bombers actually helped Israel in the struggle over international public opinion.</s>

<s i="17">The Palestinians were also intent on internationalizing the conflict and eliciting international intervention in accordance with the Kosovo model.</s> <s i="18">They failed, however.</s> <s i="19">There is little willingness to send international forces to serve as a buffer between Israelis and Palestinians.</s> <s i="20">Moreover, there is declining international readiness to render financial support to the Palestinians, due to widespread corruption.</s> <s i="21">The resulting calls for greater transparency have slowed down the stream of euros that basically allowed for greater intransigence among the Palestinians.</s> <s i="22">In addition, the emergence of new foci for humanitarian aid, Iraq being only one example, limits the amount of international funds available for transfer to the Palestinians.</s>

<s i="23">Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian national movement, who was the darling of even enlightened Western European states, has been recognized as a curse for his people and an obstacle for peace.</s> <s i="24">Much of the world has learned to see Arafat as a leading factor in radicalizing Palestinian society and pushing it to the brink, rather than building a state.</s>

<s i="25">The greatest Palestinian loss was the alienation of the center of the Israeli political map and much of the Israeli left.</s> <s i="26">The Israeli left successfully championed greater empathy for the Palestinians and for the corrupt Palestine Liberation Organization leadership.</s> <s i="27">This was crucial for moving Israeli society into greater readiness for territorial concessions.</s> <s i="28">Yet the Palestinian war discredited Yossi Beilin--now leader of the new Yahad Party--and his contemporaries, moving Israeli society into more centrist positions much less in accordance with Palestinian demands.</s> <s i="29">The majority of Israelis woke up from the �peace trip� increasingly reluctant to take security risks for an agreement with the untrustworthy Palestinians.</s>

<s i="30">Israel's proposed unilateral disengagement is a Palestinian achievement because Israel does not get anything in return for removing settlements and for withdrawing from most of Gaza.</s> <s i="31">Nevertheless, in light of Israel�s traditional readiness to accept partition and the general consensus about the need to leave Gaza, unilateral disengagement is not a Palestinian victory.</s> <s i="32">If implemented, it will not drastically alter the basic geostrategic equation.</s> <s i="33">Even a similar limited withdrawal in the West Bank will not be an Israeli defeat as long as Israel continues to have freedom of action to police Palestinian territories and to control entry.</s>

<s i="34">The war will continue for a while with oscillating levels of violence.</s> <s i="35">As war is a competition in inflicting pain, Israel is in a better position to harm the Palestinians than vice versa.</s>  <s i="36">In this war, the Palestinians have suffered more than the Jews.</s> <s i="37">The constraints imposed by Israel�s democratic character have spared the Palestinians more pain, but may have prolonged the conflict because the Palestinians have demonstrated their ability to sustain pain.</s> <s i="38">Similarly, Israeli society has shown remarkable tenacity and determination not to give in to Palestinian terror.</s> <s i="39">An assessment of the second equation in waging war--the ability to bear pain--indicates inconclusive results.</s> <s i="40">This is not that surprising, as protracted conflict in other ethnic conflicts usually shows that societies muster tremendous energies and willingness to pay a heavy price in the attainment of collective goals.</s>
