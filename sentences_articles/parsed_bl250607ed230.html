<s i="0">The Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip changed many perceptions and dynamics in the region.</s> <s i="1">But it is also the constants that must be borne in mind by the Olmert government as it enters into closer cooperation with Mahmoud Abbas and the Fateh-led West Bank.</s> 

<s i="2">First and foremost, Hamas is a dedicated Islamist organization with close ties to Iran.</s> <s i="3">It represents Islamist objectives that are totally antithetical to Israel's values as well as those of moderate secular Arabs in Palestine, Egypt and Jordan.</s> <s i="4">If Israel boycotted Hamas prior to the Gaza takeover, it has all the more reason to do so now, with the sole exceptions of humanitarian aid, prisoner exchange and a ceasefire.</s>

<s i="5">On the other hand, both Fateh/West Bank and Hamas/Gaza continue to believe firmly in the unity of the two territories.</s> <s i="6">Ehud Olmert will never be able to negotiate a permanent status agreement with Abbas about the West Bank alone.</s> <s i="7">Nor is the Hamas/Fateh political estrangement necessarily a permanent feature of the new landscape.</s> <s i="8">There is sentiment in Riyadh and some inclination in Cairo to yield to Hamas' entreaties and try and put a Palestinian unity government back together.</s> 

<s i="9">Yet the Hamas takeover in Gaza and the Fateh reaction also reflect strong and clearly incompatible core elements, Islamist and secular, in both camps.</s> <s i="10">Moreover, Hamas' new political and military concentration solely in Gaza in some ways makes it an easier target for a regional secular coalition seeking to isolate and weaken it.</s> 

<s i="11">Ongoing Palestinian devotion to West Bank-Gaza unity is not the only reason Olmert-Abbas talks cannot in the short term produce an Israeli-Palestinian peace.</s> <s i="12">Both leaders are weak; Abbas' leadership problem was particularly evident in the Fateh collapse in Gaza.</s> <s i="13">Since then he has displayed a tougher side toward both Hamas and Fateh's own armed gangs in the West Bank.</s> <s i="14">Certainly he is Olmert's only conceivable ticket to a Palestinian/regional &quot;agenda&quot; with which to prove his government's viability.</s> 

<s i="15">Hence the Abbas/Fateh/West Bank track appears, by default, to provide a useful avenue for regional diplomatic activity--but only if Abbas, Olmert, President Mubarak of Egypt and King Abdullah of Jordan are willing and able to take certain vital preliminary steps.</s> <s i="16">This is what they will hopefully discuss today in Sharm al-Sheikh.</s> 

<s i="17">In order to have any chance at all of success, Abbas must consolidate security control in the West Bank by a single Fateh/PA force in much the same way Hamas has cleared the streets of Gaza of armed militias.</s> <s i="18">He must reform his own movement's leadership institutions by replacing the &quot;dinosaurs&quot; from Tunis with new blood.</s> <s i="19">And, at least for now in view of his weakness, he must resist the temptation of a renewed unity government.</s> <s i="20">Olmert can help him by permitting the training and arming of forces loyal to Abbas and by releasing funds and prisoners.</s> <s i="21">This could be the right time to release Marwan Barghouti in order to support the younger generation of Fateh leaders.</s>

<s i="22">Mubarak has to seal off Egypt's border with Gaza much more effectively than Cairo has done so far.</s> <s i="23">Hamas in Gaza must be genuinely quarantined if its military buildup is to cease and the threat it poses to Israel and Fateh--as well as to Egypt itself--is brought under control.</s> <s i="24">And Abdullah has to offer closer economic, political and security support for Abbas' consolidated regime in the West Bank.</s>

<s i="25">The objectives of this coordinated effort should be modestly and realistically defined, and unrealistic illusions and delusions dispelled.</s> <s i="26">Both Abbas and Olmert know that it was not the absence of a peace process that brought about Hamas' rise to power, but Fateh corruption and disarray.</s> <s i="27">Thus there will be no new and dynamic peace process, no Jordanian-Palestinian union, no strategic wedge driven between West Bank and Gazan Palestinians, and no international force sealing or quarantining the Gaza Strip.</s> 

<s i="28">Rather, we can aspire to Israeli-Palestinian success in creating new tools for confidence-building and conflict management; perhaps, under the best of circumstances, a new phase of Israeli withdrawal from additional West Bank territory can be contemplated sometime in the next two or three years.</s> <s i="29">If all parties concerned, with Washington's and Brussels' backing, can stay focused on such limited objectives, they may have a chance to succeed despite the risks involved.</s>

<s i="30">And risks abound.</s> <s i="31">For Israel, the danger of releasing funds and prisoners and facilitating Palestinian security activity in the West Bank is considerable but nevertheless manageable.</s> <s i="32">Abbas and Fateh risk being branded by Hamas as collaborators.</s>
