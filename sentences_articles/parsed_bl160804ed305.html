<s i="0">Water issues can impact the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in various ways.</s> <s i="1">On the one hand the issue of allocation and control of water resources can be a source of direct conflict and dispute.</s> <s i="2">On the other hand, due to the shared nature of the resource, which leads to the need for joint management and protection of water resources from pollution, there is a strong need for cooperation.</s> <s i="3">Water as the basis of all life is described as a humanitarian issue, encouraging compassion and understanding; at the same time water is increasingly described as a human right where misallocation becomes a breach of legal norms.</s>

<s i="4">Water resources in the Israeli-Palestinian context are by definition trans-boundary issues.</s> <s i="5">Israelis and Palestinians share both groundwater and surface water resources.</s> <s i="6">The two major groundwater sources in the region are the mountain aquifer and the Coastal Aquifer.</s> <s i="7">The Mountain Aquifer is shared by Israel and the West Bank and the Coastal Aquifer shared by Israel and Gaza.</s> <s i="8">The River Jordan is the main surface water shared by Israel and the West Bank.</s> <s i="9">In the case of the shared Mountain Aquifer, Israel utilizes at least 80% of the aquifer's water resources and in the case of the Jordan no access is given for direct Palestinian use.</s> 

<s i="10">In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict water allocation remains a disputed issue but, surprisingly to most people, not an impediment to progress in peace talks.</s> <s i="11">This was witnessed in the Camp David negotiations and the Taba talks of the last days of the Barak government, where refugees, settlements and borders were the explosive issues with water no longer appearing in the headlines.</s> <s i="12">Similarly in the recent Geneva accord negotiated by Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abd Rabbo, the water issue is left for later negotiation.</s> <s i="13">Off the record, both Israeli and Palestinian water officials state that the final water allocation arrangements are more or less worked out but that they will not be declared and implemented until a peace agreement is signed.</s> 

<s i="14">Leaving water arrangements to final status comes at a heavy price to those residents that currently lack sufficient water for domestic purposes.</s> <s i="15">There are some 200 Palestinian villages that are not connected to the water network.</s> <s i="16">Particularly in days of closure they cannot even truck in the water needed for their communities.</s> <s i="17">During drought periods Palestinian residents in West Bank cities cannot be certain of water flowing in their taps in the summer months, often resulting in political pressure placed on the Israeli side to increase water supply.</s> 

<s i="18">For the Palestinians, the Oslo process (the Israeli-Palestinian bilateral track) and in particular the interim agreement of 1995 (Oslo II) brought some change for the better.</s> <s i="19">The process led to Israeli recognition of &quot;Palestinian water rights,&quot; acknowledged the need for additional water to be provided to the Palestinians, and created a Joint Water Committee to coordinate water related activities.</s> <s i="20">Under the Oslo process significant American and European funding has gone into the Palestinian water sector to provide more water to Palestinian cities and towns.</s> <s i="21">The fact that water negotiations remain incomplete, however, has left Palestinians unsatisfied with the quantity of Israeli water allocations to them and the virtual veto power that Israel enjoys in the Joint Water Committee framework.</s> 

<s i="22">Nevertheless progress has been sufficient to remove the water issue from the &quot;high politics&quot; shelf.</s> <s i="23">During this latest intifada, when all other negotiation issues came to a complete halt, both sides were able to meet and agree to continue to cooperate on water issues.</s> <s i="24">The only agreements signed by Israel and the Palestinian Authority since the outbreak of the intifada have both involved water issues: an agreement not to damage each other's water infrastructure and a recent agreement on standards for sewage treatment.</s>

<s i="25">The water meetings held and the agreements signed have unfortunately been kept out of the public eye.</s> <s i="26">On the contrary, the respective ministers responsible for water issues have issued public charges against each other--the Palestinian charging denial of drinking water by Israel and the Israeli charging sewage terrorism by the Palestinian side.</s> <s i="27">A recent study undertaken by Friends of the Earth Middle East (FoEME) concerning pollution sources of the Mountain Aquifer revealed that both Israelis and Palestinians pollute the aquifer, with 75% of the pollution coming from Palestinian sources and 25% from Israeli sources.</s> <s i="28">Above the Mountain Aquifer, which is the most important source of drinking water for both Israelis and Palestinians, the sewage of some two million people, predominantly Palestinian but in no small measure Israeli, remains either untreated or insufficiently treated.</s> 

<s i="29">It all could and should be different.</s> <s i="30">Through a US and EU government supported grant FoEME created 11 partnering communities in Israel, Jordan and Palestine.</s> <s i="31">Water issues were identified by FoEME as the focus of the cross border partnership, under the project title &quot;Good water makes good neighbors&quot;.</s> <s i="32">The project has witnessed hundreds of young people from schools and community groups becoming water trustees in their respective communities.</s> <s i="33">The water trustees carry out water awareness programs within their community and at the cross border level conduct dialogue and where possible exchange visits with their neighboring water trustees.</s> 

<s i="34">The willingness to cooperate on water issues at the community level exists because water is understood by all our peoples as essential to life.</s> <s i="35">Due to the trans-boundary nature of the water resource and regional water scarcity it is well understood by the general population that when it comes to water we are dependent on each other to protect the resource and have a responsibility to share it.</s>
