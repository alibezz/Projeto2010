<s i="0">It is virtually impossible to assess in real time the role of Israeli and Palestinian intellectuals in influencing the course of events between the two peoples.</s> <s i="1">We need the benefit of perspective in order to understand the intellectuals' impact, or lack thereof, on any given issue.</s> <s i="2">Yet even with perspective the task is difficult.</s> 

<s i="3">Suppose, for example, that an idea floated by a group of Israeli academics is adopted five or ten years later by the government of the day, which claims that it arrived at the idea as a consequence of its own analysis of key recent events.</s> <s i="4">Obviously, no one can prove a cause and effect relationship.</s> <s i="5">Israeli intellectuals, generally free of any governmental constraints on their freedom of expression, almost always also operate independently of governmental sponsorship or patronage, hence cannot easily gauge their own influence.</s> <s i="6">They can only disseminate their ideas and hope they percolate through to the top, either directly or via public opinion.</s>

<s i="7">This issue was a frequent preoccupation when I was at the Jaffee Center during the 1980s and early 1990s.</s> <s i="8">Much of our research and writing was devoted to the Arab-Israel conflict and the possibilities of peace with Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinians.</s> <s i="9">We felt confident that the ideas we disseminated were exercising influence on the decision-making echelon, but there was absolutely no way to prove it unless the politicians themselves acknowledged this--which politicians, not only in Israel, rarely do.</s>

<s i="10">Thus, for example, in 1989, at the height of the first intifada, we published a comprehensive and systematic study on Israel's options for a Palestinian settlement.</s> <s i="11">It concluded with a recommendation that the government give serious consideration to dealing directly with the Palestine Liberation Organization, and not reject the possibility that a political process would eventuate in a Palestinian state.</s> <s i="12">While we were not the first to propose these ideas, we were probably the most mainstream, and our recommendations were rooted in solid research and analysis.</s> <s i="13">We also found funding to disseminate our conclusions widely, and the media gave them broad coverage.</s>

<s i="14">Prime Minister Shamir's angry reaction to our conclusions at the time seemed to us only to confirm that we had struck a blow for better understanding of the decisions facing the country.</s> <s i="15">(There were also, incidentally, voices within the university that objected to our academic foray into &quot;politics&quot;.) Today our conclusions are at least rhetorically the foundation for the approach of yet another right wing prime minister.</s> <s i="16">Yet I have little doubt that Ariel Sharon would testify that his approach derives, not from academic research, but from a vast array of realpolitik considerations.</s>

<s i="17">Currently, one key area in which Israeli intellectuals are playing a leading role concerns the demographic consequences of ongoing occupation or even of the absence of a negotiated two state settlement.</s> <s i="18">In recent years, demographers and geographers, some with a right wing orientation, have published research urging a very far-reaching Israeli approach to territorial compromise, in order to ensure the future Jewish and democratic nature of the state.</s> <s i="19">Elements of this analysis appear to have found their way into mainstream political discourse--but not yet into decision-making.</s>

<s i="20">Viewed from the Israeli side of the conflict, Palestinian intellectuals seem to face a different set of considerations.</s> <s i="21">To a large extent they see themselves as part of a patriotic struggle for independence, hence subject to certain agreed narratives (e.g., &quot;the 1967 lines&quot;) that have no parallel on the Israeli side.</s> <s i="22">Moreover, the Palestinian leadership exercises pressures to conform to these assumptions.</s> <s i="23">Still, despite what appears to be a lesser degree of independence, by Arab standards Palestinian intellectuals seem to be relatively free to express themselves.</s> <s i="24">And within their self-imposed or externally-imposed constraints, some do appear to exercise influence over decision-making.</s> 

<s i="25">One striking example of the niche carved out for themselves by Palestinian intellectuals under sometimes difficult circumstances is polling.</s> <s i="26">Palestine has freer and more comprehensive opinion polls than any Arab country.</s> <s i="27">Yasir Arafat was, to say the least, not pleased with his popularity ratings when they began to surface in opinion polls.</s> <s i="28">Yet he undoubtedly follows them closely--as do Israeli security circles, which have confidence in their credibility.</s> <s i="29">Another area where Palestinian intellectuals have clearly exercised influence concerns governmental reform and the campaign against corruption.</s>

<s i="30">Perhaps the most striking example of Palestinian intellectual independence is Prof. Sari Nusseibeh's advocacy of abandoning the demand for a &quot;right of return&quot; to Israel.</s> <s i="31">He has been able to advocate his position--which constitutes a far-reaching challenge to a seemingly sacred tenet of the Palestinian struggle--without too many constraints.</s> <s i="32">And while he appears to have few Palestinian followers, i.e., exercises little immediate influence, the long-term effects of his campaign can only be speculated upon.</s> <s i="33">Nor can we ignore the courage mustered by Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas--a politician and an intellectual--in unequivocally condemning Palestinian terrorism.</s>

<s i="34">Over the years, when Israeli and Palestinian intellectuals have met in informal discussions of the conflict and its solutions, there have usually been far more diversity and more soul-searching among the views presented by Israelis than by Palestinians.</s> <s i="35">Indeed, many of the latter frequently &quot;coordinate&quot; their participation with the Palestinian powers-that-be.</s> <s i="36">The Israelis undoubtedly have more independence; but in some cases the Palestinians may have more influence.</s>
