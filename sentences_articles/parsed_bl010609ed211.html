<s i="0">US President Barack Obama continued his crash course on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict last week.</s> <s i="1">He held an oval office meeting with Palestinian Authority President and PLO leader Mahmoud Abbas, while his conflict team, led by George Mitchell, met in London with a high-level Israeli team to discuss settlements and outposts.</s> <s i="2">As Obama internalizes the lessons of these meetings and heads for Riyadh and Cairo this week, the prospects are perhaps not as good as he may have hoped.</s> <s i="3">The reasons, not surprisingly, have to do with domestic politics and poor leadership.</s>

<s i="4">In his US visit, Abbas once again showed why he is so ineffective.</s> <s i="5">His most telling comments, to Jackson Diehl of the Washington Post, presented a leader who acknowledges having turned down Ehud Olmert's generous final status offer of 97 percent of the territories, acceptance of the principle of the right of return, and the actual return of thousands to Israel.</s> <s i="6">Worse, Abbas now intends to sit tight and do nothing until the Netanyahu government falls, because (human rights advocates, take note) &quot;in the West Bank we have a good reality. . . the people are living a normal life.&quot;</s> <s i="7">True, the PA's security performance in the West Bank is impressive.</s> <s i="8">Still, Abbas does not pretend to have a viable formula for dealing with Hamas in Gaza or even for healing the wounds within his own party, Fateh.</s> 

<s i="9">Perhaps worst of all, Abbas--like all Palestinian politicians I have ever met--expressed his abysmal ignorance of the way Washington works when he said, &quot;Americans can use their weight with anyone around the world.</s> <s i="10">Two years ago they used their weight on us.</s> <s i="11">Now they should tell the Israelis, 'You have to comply with the conditions.'&quot;</s> <s i="12">If only it were that simple.</s> <s i="13">Netanyahu supporters who were dismayed that Abbas and Obama seemed so much more comfortable with one another than did Netanyahu and Obama are evidently no more knowledgeable than Abbas about things American.</s>

<s i="14">It is the settlements issue where the Obama administration has clearly set out to move the Israeli-Palestinian conflict into a groove from which both a negotiating process and regional movement can begin.</s> <s i="15">Indeed, it is only the settlements issue where Obama has a clear mandate to pressure Israel, and justifiably so.</s> 

<s i="16">Here the protestations voiced by Netanyahu and his supporters are pathetic.</s> <s i="17">The previous American president, George W. Bush, mistakenly allowed prime ministers Sharon and Olmert, both of whom took dramatic steps to try to mitigate the conflict, to avoid fulfilling Israel's solemn commitments to freeze settlements and remove outposts.</s> <s i="18">Netanyahu, who won't even endorse the two-state solution, thinks he can do the same, and with a president who appears to have a far wiser grasp of the Middle East.</s> <s i="19">His and Defense Minister Ehud Barak's protests about the need to allow for &quot;natural growth&quot; defy logic.</s> <s i="20">Not only do the settlers abuse &quot;natural growth&quot; to create infrastructure for expansion.</s> <s i="21">In any other Israeli community except a settlement, when affordable housing and nursery schools aren't available, those in need of them turn to other, less developed communities: they move.</s>

<s i="22">Nor does the argument of Netanyahu's emissaries that excessive US pressure regarding settlements will bring down the coalition ring true: all those newly sworn-in members of Knesset and ministers from the right-wing parties of the coalition are in no hurry to leave office so quickly, even if it means swallowing a genuine settlement freeze.</s> <s i="23">Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Mitchell should keep up the pressure, if not for Abbas' sake--he hardly deserves it--then to ensure that Israel does not overextend itself so far under the influence of messianic fanatics and weak leaders that it cannot remain a Jewish state.</s>
