<s i="0">It may be true as the Palestinian Authority says, for once in agreement with all the factions, that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip settlements, is a national achievement.</s> <s i="1">To believe so is also a natural response on behalf of the people, who need to feel a sense of accomplishment after so much suffering from the indignities and cruelties of the settlement presence in their midst, not to mention the brutality of the Israeli army's policy of collective punishment, house demolitions, random bombings, and regular military incursions for the past five years.</s>

<s i="2">But the withdrawal must be put into perspective.</s> <s i="3">It was a unilateral Israeli measure, one that came about after five years of violence that afflicted the Gaza Strip far worse, materially, economically, psychologically and socially, than any other part of historic Palestine.</s> <s i="4">That violence followed years of fruitless negotiations between the PA and Israel under the auspices of Oslo.</s> <s i="5">Furthermore, it is not going to be complete.</s> <s i="6">Beyond the fact that the West Bank--which according to international agreement is a single unit with the Gaza Strip--is still under occupation, the direct occupation of the Strip itself will not end.</s>

<s i="7">Israel will maintain control over borders, sea- and air-space, and thus movement to and from the Strip.</s> <s i="8">Under no circumstances can this be described as an end to occupation, and while Gazans undoubtedly will feel immediate relief from the obvious and intrusive elements of the colonial settlement project itself, control of their lives will ultimately still be in the hands of the Israeli army, which has furthermore reserved for itself the right to re-enter and target the Strip should it see fit.</s>

<s i="9">Then there is the political fallout.</s> <s i="10">Already Israel, backed vocally by the US, is asking the PA to pay the price for this &quot;courageous and painful&quot; withdrawal by confronting and disarming the armed factions.</s> <s i="11">Never mind that this is a recipe for internal armed conflict, or civil war, and never mind that, by and large, the dialogue route that the PA has so far chosen to go down has proven fairly successful.</s> <s i="12">Israel knows, of course, that a calm enforced only by dialogue will of necessity fail once it becomes clear to everyone that no further withdrawals are in the offing and instead there is a renewed vigor to expand and fortify illegal settlements in the West Bank.</s> 

<s i="13">But perhaps the most critical element of the Israeli withdrawal is the picture it leaves us of the future Palestine: the Gaza Strip is one entity, totally isolated from the West Bank, if not the rest of the world; also totally isolated from the West Bank is East Jerusalem; and finally, independent of them both, is a West Bank carved up between settlements and by-pass roads, with ever decreasing land as the Israeli separation wall snakes it way in and out, expropriating - a fine word for stealing - ever more land to protect the illegal settlements that are constantly expanding.</s> <s i="14">Perhaps, applying the model of &quot;the new and free&quot;</s> <s i="15">Iraq, the US and Israel intend a federal system for Palestine.</s>
