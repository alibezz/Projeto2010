<s i="0">It was striking to watch a TV clip of Ariel Sharon consoling the family of Tali Hatuel and her four daughters, who were murdered in the Gaza Strip in an Islamic Jihad terrorist attack on May 2, Likud referendum day.</s> <s i="1">&quot;Why, after 30 years of supporting and encouraging us settlers, did you reverse yourself and call for disengagement from Gaza?&quot; asked the grieving family.</s> <s i="2">In reply, Sharon could only stare at the floor and mumble that the situation had changed.</s> <s i="3">How and why it changed, he still will not tell the public.</s> 

<s i="4">This inability or unwillingness on the prime minister's part to communicate his thinking on the issue was a key factor in his referendum defeat.</s> <s i="5">The only explanation he did offer the public was that the failure to find a Palestinian negotiating partner had left a dangerous political vacuum which would be filled by pressures for far-reaching Israeli concessions unless Israel preempted with a limited withdrawal.</s> <s i="6">But this explanation generated more questions than it answered.</s> <s i="7">Had not Sharon himself played a role in ensuring that there would be no negotiating partner?</s> <s i="8">Who would and could pressure Israel to give up more territory--the Bush administration, Sharon's ally and supporter?</s> <s i="9">Was it not likely that an Israel-initiated unilateral limited withdrawal would itself generate new pressures for further concessions?</s> <s i="10">Was it not possible for Sharon to negotiate the withdrawal with the Palestine Liberation Organization, thereby getting something in return instead of &quot;giving a prize to the terrorists?&quot;</s>

<s i="11">The timing of Sharon's abrupt about face and embrace of disengagement last autumn indicates that he felt politically isolated by the Geneva accord and the wave of critical statements from serving and former senior security officials.</s> <s i="12">But he could hardly acknowledge that the political left understood the situation better than him.</s> <s i="13">So, just as he had previously, under pressure, coopted the two-state solution idea and the fence idea from the left, then proceeded to distort them for his own needs, now he sought to disengage from a small portion of the territories, not as a security measure intended to improve the atmosphere for future negotiations, but as a political act designed to end the process and leave Israel in effective control of a series of bantustans.</s> <s i="14">Even for Likud voters this was not an attractive package, insofar as many of them want a political process and understand the inevitability of at least some territorial concessions.</s>

<s i="15">Meanwhile the international community, led by Washington and beginning with US President Bush's dramatic endorsement on April 14, has signed on to disengagement.</s> <s i="16">The quartet in its statement on May 4 took &quot;positive note&quot; of it, noting that it could help jump-start a roadmap-based bilateral peace process.</s>

<s i="17">This new international support for disengagement is an extraordinary development.</s> <s i="18">I was an early adherent of unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank, including dismantling of settlements and a green line fence, beginning around three years ago.</s> <s i="19">I and others tried on several occasions to persuade Bush administration officials that the idea was worthy of their interest and support.</s> <s i="20">We cited four main arguments: the absence of a viable Palestinian negotiating partner, tactical security needs involving suicide bombings, the counter-productive nature of many aspects of the occupation and, most centrally, the demographic threat that could only be met by a deliberate process of separation.</s> 

<s i="21">At that time there were no takers in Washington for the idea, even though the polls in Israel consistently showed majority support among the public.</s> <s i="22">As for Europe, which generally takes issue with Israel and the US and argues that there is a Palestinian negotiating partner, the idea of any unilateral Israeli measure has never been discussable until now.</s>

<s i="23">Thus the strange jumble of events of the last few weeks leaves us with a reluctant Israeli leader who is apparently too embarrassed to acknowledge publicly the real rationale for disengagement--the need to maintain Israel as a Jewish and democratic state in the face of the growing Palestinian demographic advantage--perhaps because it was his settlement strategy that got us into this dilemma in the first place; but also a leader whose mistaken decision to initiate a party referendum has narrowed his political room for maneuver.</s> 

<s i="24">It leaves us with an administration in Washington that is in deep trouble in Iraq, that has neglected the Israel-Palestine conflict for years, and that now grasps at Sharon's initiative because it could conceivably be translated into an election year achievement that somehow appeals to the Arab world and to voters at home; but also an administration that is falling over itself, first to support Sharon, then to reassure the Arab world.</s> 

<s i="25">And, finally, events of recent weeks leave us with an international community that belatedly recognizes that disengagement is the only game in town, and that it is a more realistic option than ever--when in fact Sharon may no longer be able to carry it out.</s>
