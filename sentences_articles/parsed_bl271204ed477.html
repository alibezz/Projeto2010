<s i="0">Yasser Arafat's departure from the scene is an appropriate time to revisit the question of who started the current conflict.</s> <s i="1">Simply stated, had Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) been leader of the PLO in late September-early October 2000, I doubt very much the conflict would have broken out.</s> <s i="2">If it had broken out, it would not have become entrenched over the past four years.</s>

<s i="3">Undoubtedly, Ehud Barak was at fault, too, as were his predecessors, Netanyahu, Peres and Rabin.</s> <s i="4">All contributed to the Palestinians' list of grievances, many legitimate, in what was a nuanced patchwork of cause and effect.</s> <s i="5">But it was Arafat who believed that violence &quot;works&quot; with Israelis (and with fellow Arabs as well), and who ignored opportunities to exercise his leadership and stop the conflict once it broke out.</s>

<s i="6">Arafat was wrong about violence.</s> <s i="7">Without reliance on violence, and had he been ready for genuine peace, he could have had a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip back in the 1980s, based on the first Camp David process.</s> <s i="8">More than a decade later, he demonstrated to President Clinton on January 2, 2001--in rejecting Clinton's peace initiative--that (in the description of Dennis Ross, confirmed by Saudi Prince Bandar and senior Palestinians) &quot;he could live with a process, but not a conclusion&quot;.</s> <s i="9">There was an obvious symbiosis between Arafat's mafia-style inclination to violence and his inability to complete the peace process.</s>

<s i="10">Arafat's misinterpretation of two Israeli decisions that more closely preceded the current conflict is illustrative.</s> <s i="11">One was the Hashmonean tunnel incident in September 1996, which led a panicky Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu literally to embrace Arafat in Washington and enter the process that led to the Hebron agreement.</s> <s i="12">The other was the unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000.</s> <s i="13">Both moves still make sense to Israelis.</s> <s i="14">But they were undoubtedly interpreted by Arafat--incorrectly, as events have proven--as indications that Israelis did indeed only understand the language of violence.</s>

<s i="15">The violence associated with the Hashmonean tunnel events, incidentally, also had a direct effect on the tactics the Israel Defense Forces employed in the early weeks of the current struggle--tactics that appeared to backfire by helping prolong rather than shorten the conflict.</s> <s i="16">In three days of fighting in September 1996, Israel lost 15 soldiers and border policemen (compared with close to 100 Palestinian dead).</s> <s i="17">The IDF considered this to be far too high a casualty rate, and one that would encourage more Palestinian violence.</s> <s i="18">Accordingly, the army resolved that, if and when another round of fighting broke out, it would adopt more aggressive tactics with the objective of keeping its losses low and driving home to Palestinians the lesson that violence against Israel was counterproductive.</s> <s i="19">Under then Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz the IDF prepared carefully for this eventuality.</s>

<s i="20">Sure enough, after the first week or so of the Aqsa intifada there were about 100 Palestinian dead and only one Israeli soldier killed in action.</s> <s i="21">I recall a Palestinian friend phoning me at this time to complain about this asymmetrical kill ratio and accuse the IDF of killing many unarmed Palestinians; I replied that he could hardly expect me to apologize because not enough Israelis had been killed to satisfy Palestinian needs.</s> <s i="22">In the event, the effect on the Palestinians was the exact opposite of what the IDF expected: rather than capitulating, they redoubled their resolve to fight and extract heavy casualties from Israel as well.</s>

<s i="23">Placing the principal blame on Arafat does not necessarily mean an endorsement of the thesis, promulgated by senior Israeli security officials like Maj. Gen. (res.) Amos Gilad (who headed the assessment branch of IDF Intelligence in September 2000), that Arafat had carefully planned this new armed struggle as part and parcel of a strategy of subduing Israel through &quot;Palestinization&quot;--illegal migration and eventual agreed &quot;return&quot;--and violent intimidation.</s> <s i="24">This gives too much credit to Arafat as master strategist.</s> <s i="25">In fact, to understand his ultimate failure in this intifada as well as in the peace process as a whole, we have to recognize that concerning the conflict with Israel he was more a follower than a leader, more a tactician than a strategist.</s>
