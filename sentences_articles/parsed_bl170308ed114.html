<s i="0">A ceasefire with Hamas, if it happens, will be yet another link in a chain of events or march of folly that began with the Oslo accords and continued through the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza.</s>

<s i="1">We brought Yasser Arafat here in 1993 because we were assured that a paradigm change had taken place.</s> <s i="2">The Palestinians, we were told, were prepared to live in peace at our side and would prove it in their war against terrorism by extremists not subject to PLO control.</s> <s i="3">What did we get?</s> <s i="4">An arch-terrorist as the head of the Palestinian entity whom we allowed to introduce weapons into the territories and who, on the first day of his entry into Gaza brought with him, in violation of his agreement with the late PM Yitzhak Rabin, an additional terrorist hidden in his car.</s> 

<s i="5">Arafat fully exploited the naivete of Israeli decision-makers; the sad truth, which occasionally emerged in all its ugliness, was fully revealed in September 2000.</s> <s i="6">Confronted with proposals for a complete withdrawal from Gaza and a nearly complete withdrawal from Judea and Samaria, and despite the active involvement of an American president friendly to the Palestinians, Arafat initiated a terrorist war that targeted the citizens of Israel.</s> <s i="7">He was successful at murder: during one month in the spring of 2002 more than 130 Israelis were killed, most of them civilians.</s> 

<s i="8">Arafat did not hesitate to recruit Hamas for his war after refusing to combat that organization since being given jurisdiction in early 1994.</s> <s i="9">Many among us and many of Arafat's people asked themselves why he didn't take action against Hamas: the answers we gave ourselves and received from his associates were not credible.</s> <s i="10">In a lengthy conversation with Muhammad Dahlan in the course of a long night of negotiations--he accompanying Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and I the Israeli minister of defense--I understood that the Palestinian security services were doing nothing because Arafat had given clear instructions not to fight Hamas.</s> <s i="11">In 2000, Arafat's real plan became clear beyond doubt: Feisal Husseini called it the emergence from the Trojan horse.</s> 

<s i="12">And then Arafat disappeared from the scene.</s> <s i="13">He was replaced by Abu Mazen.</s> <s i="14">Dressed in a suit and not a uniform, armed with a smile rather than a pistol but devoid of any charisma, decision-making ability or pragmatism, Abd Mazen has neither the desire nor the capacity to forego the Palestinian dreams of return, Jerusalem and a state that threatens Israel.</s>

<s i="15">Shortly thereafter, with no link whatsoever to Israel's relationship with the Palestinians, the prime minister of Israel decided to withdraw unilaterally from the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="16">The &quot;experts&quot; who supported the withdrawal, flaunting logic, assured us that the Egyptians would do the job for us and prevent the transfer of weaponry into Gaza.</s> <s i="17">But they forgot to coordinate this with the Egyptians, who have done precious little since then.</s> <s i="18">We were assured that if we were fired upon from Gaza, Israel would respond seriously and would enjoy full international support since we had delivered the Gaza Strip, down to the last inch, to the Palestinians.</s> <s i="19">What possible complaints could there be against the state of Israel as it withdraws of its own free will, without asking anything in return, they asked.</s>

<s i="20">The result was somewhat different.</s> <s i="21">The wide-open border with Egypt allowed the trickle that had flowed through the tunnels under the border when it was secured by the IDF to become a raging river of weapons, ammunition and Iranian military experts.</s> <s i="22">The Strip became a new model of Lebanon, with the world not agreeing that Israel cease to be responsible to supply Gaza's vital needs even as we were unable to implement our responsibility for the security of Israeli citizens.</s> <s i="23">No wonder the Qassams fired at Sderot became a veritable downpour.</s> <s i="24">Once again civilians became the targets of Palestinians who proved they have no moral compunctions.</s>

<s i="25">A few months after Israel's withdrawal, the Palestinians held democratic elections and the people spoke.</s> <s i="26">They chose between Fateh's corruption and Hamas' cruelty.</s> <s i="27">No doubt, Israel's withdrawal from Gaza aided Hamas, which was now seen as having done the job of expelling the IDF.</s> <s i="28">Thus it was not the Fateh activists in their villas who were seen as worthy of glory, but rather the religious fundamentalists.</s> <s i="29">Some time later, Hamas became fed up with shared rule, murdered a number of its Fateh colleagues and took over exclusive rule in the Gazan quasi-state.</s> <s i="30">The responsibility it now ostensibly held had no effect on its behavior: it continued to arm itself, shoot at Israel and threaten its towns and villages.</s>

<s i="31">Finally, two weeks ago, following the firing of Katyusha rockets at Ashkelon--beyond the usual Qassam firings at Sderot--Israel, in an unusual step, got angry.</s> <s i="32">It launched a small ground operation; in the course of four days, the IDF killed more than 100 Hamas fighters and, unfortunately, some 20 innocent civilians.</s> <s i="33">Hamas understood that despite its lofty rhetoric and its leaders' arrogance a decision by the IDF to enter the Strip with a large force would erase all of Hamas' achievements in less than a week.</s> <s i="34">No wonder Hamas is seeking a ceasefire with Egyptian help.</s>
