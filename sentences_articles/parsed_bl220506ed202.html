<s i="0">Once again the only members of Knesset we must pity are the Arabs, and particularly those elected on the Arab national lists.</s> <s i="1">They are irrelevant at two levels: that of the Knesset and its majority, but also the level of the Arab sector that they neglected and that largely ignored them in the elections.</s> <s i="2">Even if we include the votes falsified or (according to press reports and rumors) bought at a high price, only 39 percent of the Arabs voted for the three Arab lists that comprised no fewer than seven parties.</s>

<s i="3">Significant external factors influenced the elections to the 17th Knesset.</s> <s i="4">On the one hand, Hamas surprisingly rose to power amidst the atmosphere of crisis that pervades Palestinians' lives.</s> <s i="5">On the other, Israel abandoned the bilateral solution and turned to managing the conflict unilaterally, as it planned and implemented steps that can have only one outcome: perpetuating the conflict for at least several more years.</s>

<s i="6">These background factors highlight the substantive changes in the lives of the Palestinian citizens of Israel.</s> <s i="7">The hope that an end to the conflict would create a new reality was dashed.</s> <s i="8">The expectation of equal status, at least at the civil level, was replaced by more land confiscation, legislation defining the Jewish character of the state in basic laws, the High Court of Justice's ratification of an amendment to the citizenship law that prevents unification of mixed Palestinian families from both sides of the green line, ongoing discrimination in all walks of life, house demolitions and a long list of unilateral steps that merely substantiate the lack of any chance for progress and the Israeli convictionb that the foundation of government remain Jewish superiority.</s>

<s i="9">The internal disintegration of Palestinian society in Israel has deepened at all levels: social, political, community, geographic, etc. At the political level, competition is based less and less on political programs and increasingly on personal considerations of advancing this or that leader.</s> <s i="10">At the community level, more than any other, the situation has deteriorated due to power struggles between diverse sects and the growing distance between Palestinians in the Negev and those in the Galilee.</s> <s i="11">Problems of community violence, struggles between clans and attitudes toward women have only worsened in recent years.</s>

<s i="12">The Arab parties have exacerbated these problems.</s> <s i="13">Rather than confronting or changing the existing social structure, they have exploited it for political gain at the local as well as national level.</s> <s i="14">As for the struggle against discriminatory policies, the parliamentary political parties are, not surprisingly, barely functional (except on Arab television screens).</s>

<s i="15">The Palestinian public in Israel is more aware than ever of its marginal status in the Israeli system and its lack of opportunity to affect decision-making in the Knesset and the government.</s> <s i="16">It recognizes that it is a marginal minority, devoid of influence, appended to the project of determining the Jewish nature of the country.</s> <s i="17">While it sees no benefit to its interests within parliamentary politics, it does find opportunities for activity outside the parliamentary arena.</s> <s i="18">This is the main factor explaining the sharp drop in Arab voting percentages.</s>

<s i="19">In view of the emergence of the Olmert government with its intention of implementing further unilateral disengagement, it is distressingly likely that we shall again witness a scenario in which the establishment addresses the Arab Knesset members as an auxiliary force to be &quot;deployed&quot; in the event the ruling party lacks sufficient support within the coalition.</s> <s i="20">Experience teaches us that when the Olmert government decides to withdraw from additional areas of the West Bank and effectively anchor the Israeli apartheid regime there and in Gaza in a mini-state of fragmented enclaves, and when some of the right-wingers in Kadima revolt against even these steps, the government will always be able to rely on Arab MKs to vote for its program--just as MKs Baraka and Bishara voted for compensation for the Gaza evacuees in the previous Knesset.</s>
