<s i="0">The next Israeli government would be well advised to take another look at its approach to Hamas.</s> <s i="1">The objective should be to develop a more coherent strategy toward the Palestinian Islamist movement and its stronghold, the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="2">(The next American government should follow suit; but that is another matter.)

The current strategy--to the extent it has even been formulated as a strategy by the Olmert government--has not worked well.</s> <s i="3">Economic pressures on the Gazan population have failed to weaken or dislodge Hamas.</s> <s i="4">A military option is repeatedly rejected for fear it will prove costly and counterproductive.</s> <s i="5">A prisoner exchange has proven elusive.</s> <s i="6">Only the ceasefire appears to be working, but even that achievement will be jeopardized if, by the end of its agreed six-month duration in December, there is no progress in other spheres of Hamas-Israel interaction.</s>

<s i="7">A better Israeli strategy for dealing with Hamas is at least partially a function of the success or failure of Israel's peace strategy vis-a-vis the PLO/Fateh and the West Bank.</s> <s i="8">We don't want to strengthen Hamas as a rival to the PLO.</s> <s i="9">Yet, judging by our experience of recent years it is not clear what strengthens and what weakens Hamas: does the Islamist movement, for example, gain more from a ceasefire than from the &quot;martyrdom&quot; of its terrorists who attack our civilians?</s> <s i="10">Nor, by the same token, do we know for sure how to strengthen the PLO as a counterforce to Hamas without jeopardizing our security (for example, by offering excessive or hasty concessions).</s> <s i="11">Even removal of settlements and outposts, which will ostensibly strengthen the PLO when carried out in the West Bank, proved counterproductive to the cause of peaceful coexistence with Hamas in Gaza after 2005.</s>

<s i="12">Clearly, Hamas has entrenched itself in the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="13">There is no near-term prospect of it being dislodged physically or politically from there, nor is anyone (Israel, the PLO, Egypt) likely soon to try.</s> <s i="14">Israeli and PLO efforts to prevent further aggrandizement of Hamas' power and influence and expansion of the Hamas presence currently focus on the West Bank, not Gaza.</s> <s i="15">Any sort of peace breakthrough or achievement by outgoing Israeli PM Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will, under the best of circumstances, apply only to the West Bank.</s> <s i="16">Needless to say, this constraint is liable to call into question the entire Israeli-Palestinian negotiating project.</s> 

<s i="17">It is far more likely that there will be no breakthrough.</s> <s i="18">Either way, Israel has to stop improvising a strategy for dealing with Gaza and come up with a more coherent approach that takes into account the state of relations with the PLO and Egypt but does not allow these two actors to dictate our stand.</s>

<s i="19">Given that the choice between war and a ceasefire with Hamas will remain off the Israeli agenda as long as the current ceasefire continues and appears to be beneficial, there are still two important steps that Israel can take with the objective of developing and articulating a more coherent strategy.</s> 

<s i="20">One is to abandon economic sanctions and boycotts of the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="21">The use of an economic &quot;stick&quot; to influence the behavior of Gazans and their regime has proven fruitless.</s> <s i="22">It causes unnecessary humanitarian hardship on Israel's &quot;watch&quot;.</s> <s i="23">Had Israel's economic chokehold on Gaza over the past year produced a more moderate and peace-minded regime there, the imposition of so much suffering might be deemed worthwhile.</s> <s i="24">But this is simply not the case and the time has come to reconsider.</s> <s i="25">The experience of recent years shows that it is far more effective to inflict military blows, including directly senior Hamas leaders, rather than closing passages and limiting supplies of medicines as a means of obliging the Hamas leadership to rethink its terrorist policies.</s>

<s i="26">The second step is to recognize that Hamas is here to stay and is our neighbor and to begin talking directly with the movement, without conditions.</s> <s i="27">Such contacts should initially take place at the informal level.</s> <s i="28">Here and there, Israelis from the political left, right and religious right have already met unofficially on neutral ground with representatives of Hamas.</s> <s i="29">These contacts should be expanded, with Hamas encouraged to send higher level representatives.</s> <s i="30">The idea is not to write draft peace treaties; Hamas is clearly not a candidate.</s> <s i="31">Rather, we should get to know the movement and its thinking better and allow it to know us better.</s>
