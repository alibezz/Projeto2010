<s i="0">Military occupation and armed conflict breed human rights violations.</s> <s i="1">So does non-democratic and corrupt government.</s> <s i="2">Inevitably, the very nature of occupation, conflict and governmental corruption renders it difficult to address and rectify the violations.</s>

<s i="3">There are many highly dedicated and skilled individuals and organizations on both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and among concerned third parties, who seek to remedy these human rights violations and to educate to prevent them.</s> <s i="4">Obviously, they deserve our support.</s> <s i="5">From a strategic standpoint - one that deals not directly with human rights but rather with the entirety of the conflict - the question is: what is the best way to do this?</s> <s i="6">Where should resources and efforts be concentrated in order to bring about a truly radical improvement in the human rights situation in the Israel-Palestine arena?</s>

<s i="7">This question begs another: whose human rights?</s> <s i="8">Through the good works of Israeli, Palestinian and international organizations and journalists we are familiar with the state of human rights violations perpetrated by Israelis against Palestinians: problems of detention, house demolitions, excesses by Israeli forces at roadblocks and elsewhere, health and education deprivation, restrictions on freedom of movement, etc. Incidentally, all Israeli governments have also to one extent or another violated the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel, an area that is clearly conflict related.</s> 

<s i="9">Then there are the settlers who claim that the government's intention of dismantling their settlements violates their human rights and constitutes &quot;transfer&quot;.</s> <s i="10">Many Israelis and all Palestinians are not impressed with this argument, even though the settlers, many of whom acted in good faith in accepting government incentives to live in the territories, deserve fair treatment and compensation unless they opt for violence.</s> 

<s i="11">At the other end of the spectrum, there are the Israeli civilian victims of indiscriminate Palestinian suicide bombings and other forms of terrorism.</s> <s i="12">Obviously, their human rights too were violated.</s> <s i="13">Few Palestinians have focused on this issue in human rights terms, even though it has been a moving force in Israeli policy decisions, like building the fence, that in turn have seriously affected Palestinian human rights.</s> <s i="14">And then there are the wholesale violations of human rights of Palestinian citizens by their own government, a reflection of the dismal rights situation throughout the Arab world, but also, in our case, of the complex social and political history of modern Palestine.</s> <s i="15">Finally, in the Palestinian context, the suicide bombings themselves, with their aura of heroism among Palestinian youth lining up to put on explosive vests, turn the entire issue on its head: what is the relevance of human rights when members of one camp glorify their own suicides among a crowd of civilians from the other?</s>

<s i="16">Obviously, the optimal approach to human rights in this conflict is a comprehensive one that seeks to deal with all the violated rights of all concerned on both sides.</s> <s i="17">Essentially, the human rights advocates argue that ways must be found for Israelis and Palestinians to wage a cleaner war, one that deprives fewer non-combatants of their basic human rights.</s> <s i="18">A lot of human and financial resources are devoted toward this end, with considerable international support.</s> 

<s i="19">But is this the best allocation of these resources?</s> <s i="20">A number of active participants in the international aid effort to provide basic Palestinian needs in terms of nourishment, medication and education under harsh conditions of combat and occupation argue that in so doing they are filling a function that international law actually demands of Israel; hence they are merely prolonging the Israeli occupation.</s> <s i="21">Cease the international donor effort, they propose: in the short term many Palestinians will suffer more; but Israel, when confronted with international pressure to feed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians on its own, will end the occupation that much sooner.</s>

<s i="22">This is a problematic proposition.</s> <s i="23">A boycott by the international aid community might just as easily oblige Israel, with its overriding security concerns, to renew full occupation in areas &quot;A&quot; that it has hitherto generally entered only fleetingly.</s> <s i="24">This will hardly enhance Palestinians' human rights.</s> <s i="25">But the intellectual exercise of considering this option does highlight the centrality of the conflict in the human rights equation.</s> 

<s i="26">Indeed, it brings us full circle, back to the broad strategic level.</s> <s i="27">Is it not conceivable that, given the option of deploying diplomatic and other resources in one direction or another, the appropriate approach would be to devote resources toward ending the occupation and the conflict rather than toward mitigating human rights violations under conditions of conflict?</s> <s i="28">If there is no occupation at all, Israelis won't be violating Palestinian human rights and Palestinian terrorism against Israelis will at least decrease, if not end.</s>
