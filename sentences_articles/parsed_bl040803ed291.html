<s i="0">The achievements registered almost overnight by the Palestinian Authority in reducing extreme instances of incitement in the media--glorified calls to Palestinian children to achieve martyrdom, demonic depictions of Israel, etc.--appear to offer testimony to two key aspects of the Palestinian reality.</s> <s i="1">First, much of the incitement has been officially inspired.</s> <s i="2">And secondly, the powers-that-be in Ramallah, whatever their limitations and constraints, are in control, at least on this issue.</s>

<s i="3">At a more fundamental level, long before the advent of the current ceasefire, a process of revision of Palestinian textbooks succeeded in considerably reducing incitement in the material that Palestinian children study in school.</s> <s i="4">There are still plenty of maps that ignore the existence of the State of Israel, and plenty of texts that ignore or obfuscate the Jewish roots and history of the Land of Israel/Palestine.</s> <s i="5">But these are errors of omission rather than active incitement, and they have occasional parallels--that unfortunately are largely ignored--in Israeli textbooks and maps and in the Israeli media as well.</s> 

<s i="6">Nor can we ignore the fact that the old Palestinian textbooks were actually Egyptian and Jordanian, and that the rest of the Arab world, beginning with these two countries that have signed peace treaties with Israel, has made virtually no effort at all to address the distortions and insufficiencies in the way their children study about Israel and the peace process.</s>

<s i="7">But Egypt and Jordan are not at war with Israel and have no existential territorial quarrel with it, as the Palestinians do.</s> <s i="8">Hence our preoccupation with the way Palestinians portray us.</s>

<s i="9">Beyond the reduction of incitement there lies a moral and political dilemma.</s> <s i="10">It is one thing to insist that Palestinians omit offensive portrayals of Jews and eliminate appeals, direct or indirect, to murder them.</s> <s i="11">But to what extent can we insist that Palestinians actually tell our story, our narrative, to their children?</s> <s i="12">For it is only by juxtaposing our version of events--particularly the events of 1948 and the Zionist narrative in general--with theirs, that Palestinian children are likely to develop a capacity toward greater tolerance and understanding of the underpinnings of a genuine two state solution.</s> 

<s i="13">Of course this argument goes both ways.</s> <s i="14">The religiously motivated settlers of Gush Emmunim and the ultra-orthodox--two prime supporters of a hard line policy in the West Bank and Gaza--are also desperately in need of greater exposure to the Palestinian narrative.</s> <s i="15">But in the context of this discussion (though not in a broader context regarding violence) they are comparable to Hamas rather than to the less religious Palestinian mainstream, in the sense that the children of people with one-sided and absolute religious convictions regarding sanctification of the land and of themselves as believers, are not easily disabused of these notions as long as their parents control the schools and the community in which they learn.</s> <s i="16">Only an atmosphere of peace and greater tolerance generated by the mainstream on both sides will erode away support for these extremist positions.</s>

<s i="17">I recently suggested to several Palestinians who have dealt actively with reducing incitement that the two sides agree not merely to expunge offensive statements and portrayals of the other, but that they include in their respective textbooks, at the appropriate level, a jointly authored statement that presents the key historical and political narratives of both sides.</s> <s i="18">It could be authored by a joint committee of historians.</s> 

<s i="19">On an experimental basis each side in this committee would be allotted 500 to 1,000 words in which to describe its version of the events from 1948 to the present, the meaning and moral and political underpinnings of its approach to the Land of Israel/Palestine in the course of the past 100 years, its position regarding the refugee/right of return issue, Jerusalem, Israel's legitimacy, etc. Each side would have the right to challenge passages written by the other on the grounds that they constitute incitement or are hurtful.</s> <s i="20">Both sides would have to agree to the complete final text of this 1,000 to 2,000-word statement, which would then become mandatory reading and material for discussion by their youth.</s>

<s i="21">I believe such a statement would be acceptable to Israeli educational institutions, many of which already &quot;teach&quot; the Palestinian narrative.</s> <s i="22">But my Palestinian associates reacted icily to the idea: now, they noted, was not a good time.</s> <s i="23">In other words, they will listen to Israelis' critique of incitement in their media and textbooks and try to respond; and they will of course, quite justifiably, cite instances of incitement in the Israeli media.</s> <s i="24">But they will not systematically expose their youth to the Israeli version of events, even in return for a reciprocal move among Israelis.</s>

<s i="25">I believe that this Palestinian response is not motivated by a fear that exposure to our narrative will somehow turn their kids into Zionists.</s> <s i="26">Most adult Palestinians know the Israeli narrative well, and the Palestinian press reprints far more Israeli press reports and op-eds that reflect this narrative than vice versa.</s> <s i="27">Rather, it appears to go to the heart of the asymmetry in our conflict: Israelis now largely accept the notions of Palestinian peoplehood and Palestinian sovereignty over part of the land, just as they recognize that they live in a neighborhood dominated--historically, demographically, politically--by Egypt, Jordan and 20 additional Arab states.</s> <s i="28">Palestinians and most other Arabs, on the other hand, still have not come to terms with Jewish peoplehood, nationhood and sovereign rights and their consequences in even part of the land that constitutes the ancient Jewish homeland.</s>
