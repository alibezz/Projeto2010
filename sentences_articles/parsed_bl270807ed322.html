<s i="0">New-old winds are blowing in the Middle East.</s> <s i="1">In early November a conference is supposed to take place under American auspices where an Israeli-Palestinian settlement will be discussed and, many hope, agreed.</s> <s i="2">If indeed the conference produces such a breakthrough, those involved in advancing the Arab peace initiative see improved chances for realizing the regional vision it lays out in general terms.</s>

<s i="3">In anticipation of the conference and in an effort to prevent it becoming yet another symbol of prolonged political paralysis, the various involved parties are busy laying the groundwork for a businesslike exchange of views.</s> <s i="4">Naturally most of the activity is at the Israeli-Palestinian level, with renewed contacts focusing on ways in which Israel can strengthen the Palestinian Authority and joint thinking about the principles of an agreed settlement.</s> 

<s i="5">Conference preparations dovetail with the developments that have taken place in the Israeli-Palestinian arena since the schism between the two leading Palestinian movements, Fateh and Hamas, which was generated by Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="6">The rift, with its geographic imprint, is seen by many as rendering Israeli-Palestinian dialogue over an agreement that much easier.</s> <s i="7">The guidelines of the government formed in Ramallah after the coup in Gaza include an undertaking to end the conflict and omit any commitment to &quot;resistance&quot;.</s> <s i="8">Hence they ostensibly constitute a promising platform for pragmatic dialogue.</s>

<s i="9">Yet, when Israel discusses with the PA security coordination, concessions on movement of the civilian population, release of prisoners or transfer of tax funds--with whom is it talking?</s> <s i="10">These contacts take place between Israel and one Palestinian government, alongside which there functions a second, boycotted government.</s> <s i="11">The legal significance of this complex political situation can be bypassed since in any case PA President Mahmoud Abbas holds the mandate for peace negotiations.</s> <s i="12">But the complexity is not merely legal; it also reflects an ideological and institutional split that has emerged as--over the past seven years of confrontation with Israel and particularly the direct Palestinian-to-Palestinian confrontation--central rule in the territories has collapsed.</s> <s i="13">One expression of this collapse is the PA's inability to make long-term decisions, not to mention implementation of policies for improving security that might deny Israel any excuse for continuing to suspend the peace process.</s>

<s i="14">Despite the massive international backing it enjoys, the Fateh government does not have sufficient local legitimization to commit to a settlement based on the principle of two states for two peoples; it certainly can't guarantee implementation of such an agreement.</s> <s i="15">In contrast, Hamas has a proven capacity to drag Israel into responding militarily to its terrorist attacks, thereby thwarting any attempt to advance toward security and implementation of agreements.</s> <s i="16">Hamas will undoubtedly take this route if it is left out of the peace process that is currently taking shape.</s> <s i="17">This will happen because Hamas continues to reject the demands made by Israel and the Quartet as conditions for dialogue.</s> 

<s i="18">Further, Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip and the failed attempt to maintain a Palestinian unity government brought the rivalry between Hamas and Fateh to new levels that defy resolution.</s> <s i="19">Progress toward peace will only escalate the struggle, while failure of the planned process will further weaken the camp led by Fateh and further empower Hamas: the law of connected vessels works in the Palestinian arena like anywhere else.</s>

<s i="20">From Israel's standpoint, the Fateh-Hamas rivalry complicates the already complex challenge of dealing with final status issues.</s> <s i="21">Evidently, Hamas cannot be changed; its ideological platform is inflexible.</s> <s i="22">Its popular support, which does not exceed that of Fateh, nevertheless enables it to challenge the traditional national leadership.</s> <s i="23">Thus if this Israeli government really seeks a viable final status agreement it must alter the political-territorial arena in which the conflict takes place.</s> <s i="24">This it can do by displaying a willingness to negotiate borders, refugees and Jerusalem on the basis of the Arab peace initiative.</s> 

<s i="25">In other words, Israel has to make the Palestinian public an offer it can't refuse in order to bypass Hamas on the road to making and implementing a deal.</s> <s i="26">The thaw in Israel's relations with the Arab states as a consequence of such a deal will help reduce both the security risks it takes upon itself and the price it pays in terms of concessions without which a deal is impossible.</s>
