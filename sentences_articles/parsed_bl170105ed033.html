<s i="0">The Israeli public decided to dismantle settlements long ago, as evidenced by its overwhelming support for PM Sharon's disengagement plan, including the removal of all the Gaza Strip settlements and four in northern Samaria.</s> <s i="1">Indeed, it was only public pressure that led Sharon to initiate his withdrawal plan in order to generate a political departure that would extract us from the bloodshed of recent years.</s> <s i="2">This is good news for those who support the peace process or the ending of occupation unilaterally.</s>

<s i="3">The settlers, and particularly their extremist leadership, the Yesha Council, understand that the decision has fallen.</s> <s i="4">From their standpoint the only way to thwart this move is to prove that it's not feasible.</s> <s i="5">They are using heavy ammunition: threats to attack soldiers and assassinate the prime minister, massive disobedience, and above all, civil war.</s> <s i="6">We, they declare, will have no mercy if you don't accept our stand and our outlook.</s>

<s i="7">The settlers are exploiting the sense of shared fate and collective sacrifice held by the citizens of a nation state.</s> <s i="8">Most Israelis find it difficult to bear the sight of security personnel behaving aggressively and violently toward Jews; those images are liable to cause the entire enterprise to fail.</s> <s i="9">A civil war scare campaign is spreading horror throughout Israeli society.</s> <s i="10">Its effectiveness is liable to deter us from seeing this conflict through to its end.</s>

<s i="11">Accordingly, in order to ensure that disengagement takes place without pushing the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) into a dangerous corner in the national consciousness, the government must announce a timetable for taking all necessary measures to remove the settlers from Gaza with respect, sensitivity, and attentiveness to their needs and their protest, including financial and other compensation designed to ease the transition and adjustment.</s>

<s i="12">At the end of this period, following sincere efforts to remove the maximum number of Gaza and northern Samaria settlers--and at a later stage the rest of the settlers in the West Bank and Gaza--the State of Israel will withdraw to an international border recognized by the United Nations and the world community.</s> <s i="13">From this time on, the remaining settlers will be permitted to return to Israel's sovereign territory in accordance with the Law of Return.</s>

<s i="14">These steps will spare us the television images of tear gas, billy sticks, and women and babies being dragged on the ground, and will deflate the settlers' struggle.</s> <s i="15">The government must not provide a stage for the provocative, &quot;heroic&quot; and determined demonstration of opposition that constitutes the settlers' strongest weapon.</s> <s i="16">Only in this way can we have a legitimate ideological, political and democratic debate, free from threats and brutality.</s>

<s i="17">This, then, is the right decision politically and strategically.</s> <s i="18">There remains the question: if the IDF withdraws from the Gaza Strip, what happens to the stubborn settlers who prefer to remain in place, without protection, without infrastructure and without sovereignty?</s> <s i="19">Are we not responsible for their welfare?</s> <s i="20">What is the obligation of the state to protect its citizens that are violating its laws and decisions outside its borders?</s> <s i="21">These are weighty issues.</s>

<s i="22">The dismantling of settlements will determine whether Israel remains a national Jewish state.</s> <s i="23">Conceptually (not tactically), anyone seeking to thwart the disengagement by force is a ticking bomb that must quickly be neutralized.</s> <s i="24">Dismantling settlements is a vital condition for the existence of the state.</s> <s i="25">Whoever thwarts it endangers the state's future.</s> <s i="26">When the future of Israeli society is weighed against the fate of a group of citizens who opt to endanger themselves, the answer is clear.</s>

<s i="27">In parallel, the Palestinian Authority, in full coordination with Israel, will take security responsibility for the lives of those Israeli citizens--if there are any--who choose to remain on its territory.</s>
