<s i="0">Much has happened in the last 30 odd years, but one of the more notable changes is the Israeli attitude toward negotiations.</s> <s i="1">While Israel used to publicly claim to the world that it was seeking to negotiate with Palestinians and the Arab countries, today the world, for all its pressure, cannot push the Israeli government to talk with the Palestinians.</s>
 
<s i="2">Shortly after the 1967 occupation of the Arab territories, Israeli leaders issued an APB (All Points Bulletin, in police terms) calling on Arab leaders to sit down and negotiate with the state of Israel.</s> <s i="3">At the time, Arab leaders rejected this call and responded at the Khartoum Arab summit with the famous three nos: no peace with Israel; no recognition of Israel; and no negotiations with Israel.</s>
 
<s i="4">Today Palestinian leaders, including the moderate President Mahmoud Abbas, who has consistently voiced his opposition to the militarization of the intifada, are constantly calling on their Israeli counterparts to sit down and talk to them.</s> <s i="5">But the Israelis prefer to act unilaterally rather than conduct face-to-face bilateral negotiations.</s>
 
<s i="6">Unilateralism is the easy way out because it avoids the challenge of negotiations.</s> <s i="7">By acting unilaterally, parties are not obliged to make any concessions they don't want while appearing to compromise.</s>
 
<s i="8">The lack of desire to negotiate is not limited to the Israelis.</s> <s i="9">Hardline Palestinian factions are also not very keen on negotiations.</s> <s i="10">Hamas has made it clear it is not planning to field enough candidates to win the upcoming Palestinian legislative elections because it is not interested in participating in negotiations with the Israelis.</s>
 
<s i="11">Islamic Jihad, which continues to break the self-imposed tahdia (calm), is also not interested in any substantive negotiations.</s> <s i="12">Like the Sharon government, but without its military might, Islamic Jihad would like to carry out unilateral actions that don't require it to sit face-to-face with its enemy and therefore do not force the group to make binding commitments.</s>
 
<s i="13">Unilateralism has its clear limits.</s> <s i="14">The unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Gaza didn't solve the problems of Gaza.</s> <s i="15">If US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice hadn't shown up and forced the two sides to sit down and resolve the Rafah crossing issue, the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip would have continued to live in a large prison.</s>
 
<s i="16">The Palestinian and Israeli elections will surely produce more centrist politicians rather than the radicals that have been in charge so far, at least on the Israeli side.</s> <s i="17">The unilateral mood that has existed since the turn of this century will surely be replaced by Israeli and, to a lesser extent, Palestinian leaders who will at least claim that they want to negotiate a solution to the outstanding issues between both sides.</s>
 
<s i="18">The change in Israeli politics might have been speeded up by the surprise rise to power of a Labor party leader with Moroccan roots, Amir Peretz, who wants to have direct talks with the Palestinians.</s> <s i="19">Suddenly all Israeli leaders running in the March elections are saying that they too think that negotiations are the only way to resolve the conflict.</s>
 
<s i="20">Agreeing to negotiate is an important step, but unless it allows for all parties to represent their points of view, what ensues might be nothing but a dialogue of the deaf.</s>
