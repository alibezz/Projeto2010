<s i="0">In terms of Israel's interests in the Palestinian arena, many of the ramifications of the end of fighting in Lebanon are negative, both militarily and politically.</s>

<s i="1">United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which temporarily ended the fighting in the Lebanese arena but is already proving difficult to enforce, is generally also a poor model for an Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire in Gaza.</s> <s i="2">In Lebanon, an international force is being introduced to support a weak government that at least has good intentions.</s> <s i="3">A similar measure in Gaza would support an equally weak--but extremist--Hamas government that is liable to draw encouragement from Hizballah's successes over the past month.</s> 

<s i="4">On the other hand, Israel's increasingly obvious military achievements in Gaza (Qassam rocket firings were down to about a dozen last week and have ceased in recent days) obviate the need for anything but humanitarian international intervention there.</s> <s i="5">Nor have Israeli forces reoccupied Gaza as they have southern Lebanon.</s> <s i="6">Moreover, 1701 blames Hizballah for starting the war and does not in any way criticize Israel for its offensive in Lebanon and the damage and loss of life it caused.</s> <s i="7">This is a helpful precedent for Gaza, where the IDF will now be free--assuming peace and quiet in Lebanon--to deploy more forces if needed.</s>

<s i="8">Broadly speaking, it is not at all clear whether a war fought by Israel in Lebanon to restore its deterrent profile has actually done so.</s> <s i="9">This could have negative repercussions for the way Palestinian militants view Israel.</s> <s i="10">The most obvious example is the failure of 1701 to return Israel's two abducted soldiers from Lebanon.</s> <s i="11">This hardly bodes well for a resolution of the hostage affair in Gaza.</s> <s i="12">More important is the warning by senior Israeli security officials that Hamas will now seek to obtain a rocket arsenal similar to that deployed so effectively by Hizballah in Lebanon.</s>

<s i="13">Moving from military to political repercussions, the conclusion of the war in Lebanon does not improve the prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process.</s> <s i="14">Some on the Israeli left are calling for the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference to be reconvened, or some other multilateral process invoked, as a means of using the outcome of this war to leverage a renewed political process.</s> <s i="15">But Madrid followed an American-led military triumph that ostensibly ushered in a regional pax Americana, which in turn helped generate a peace process.</s> <s i="16">In contrast, the United States is now in deep trouble in the Middle East, while the Lebanon conflict ended without a decisive victory for either side.</s> <s i="17">Many see these circumstances as an achievement for Islamist forces in the region that have no interest in peace with Israel.</s> 

<s i="18">Certainly the Palestinian Authority remains as weak and anarchic as before the war, and no one is pressuring Israel to consider it a viable partner for negotiations.</s> <s i="19">Even PM Ehud Olmert's disengagement initiative on the West Bank has now at least temporarily been shelved; Olmert has emerged from this war (and from 1701) weakened politically, with his initiative discredited by the violent aftermath of Israel's two previous unilateral disengagements.</s>

<s i="20">On the regional map that has emerged over the past two months, Israel confronts militant and aggressive Islamist enemies in Lebanon and Gaza.</s> <s i="21">They are backed by Iran and its client state, Syria; reject Israel's very existence; and feed on failed Arab political entities on two fronts.</s> <s i="22">Under these circumstances, if any peace initiative at all is conceivable at this point, it is likely to be directed toward Syria, not the Palestinians.</s> <s i="23">Damascus is perceived as the weak link in the Iranian-led front against Israel--and the Iranian threat now takes unequivocal precedence over the Palestinian problem.</s>
