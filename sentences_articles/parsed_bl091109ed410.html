<s i="0">The issues of Israeli settlement activity and the need for a settlement construction freeze are again at the top of the political agenda.</s> 

<s i="1">This is not least due to the baffling statement by Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, hailing the current Israeli position on settlements as unprecedented.</s> <s i="2">While she qualified that statement in subsequent days, it proved the final straw as far as Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, was concerned.</s> <s i="3">He reacted to the statement by announcing, first in front of the PLO's Executive Committee and then in a speech to the public, that he would not be seeking re-election.</s> 

<s i="4">Abbas explained that his decision was prompted by a US position that continues to condone Israel's settlement project, rendering the peace process that Washington is calling for meaningless.</s> 

<s i="5">Clinton made two major mistakes in her statement ten days ago alongside Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister.</s> <s i="6">First, the Israeli position on settlements she referred to is not at all unprecedented.</s> <s i="7">Statistics show that, within the definition of the settlement &quot;freeze&quot; the Americans conveyed to the Palestinians, Israel would be building a number of housing units equal to the average it has built over the last four years.</s> 

<s i="8">Her second mistake was that she confused a settlement freeze with the future of the settlements.</s> <s i="9">According to the Oslo agreements, negotiations should deal with the fate of settlements.</s> <s i="10">The expansion of settlements was not a final status negotiating issue.</s> <s i="11">There is a logical contradiction between negotiating an end to the occupation on the one hand and continuing settlement construction, which consolidates that occupation, on the other.</s>

<s i="12">This is not the first time Israeli settlement expansion activities threaten the future of the peace process.</s> <s i="13">A thorough study of the history of the peace process reveals that the insistence of Israel to continue jeopardizing and pre-empting negotiations by unilaterally and forcibly creating facts on the ground that are consistent only with Israel's vision of the future and contradictory to the Palestinian vision has always been a major cause of crisis during the different phases of the peace process.</s> <s i="14">At the same time, it has been a cause of tension and radicalization in Palestinian society.</s> 

<s i="15">Abbas and, before him Yasser Arafat, agreed to negotiate while settlement construction continued only in the hope that it would thereby stop.</s> <s i="16">The fact that it didn't is the reason why Palestinians will no longer agree to negotiate under such circumstances.</s> <s i="17">The other reason is that the Obama administration closely followed the sequence of the roadmap and agreed that settlement construction should stop in preparation for negotiations.</s> <s i="18">It makes little sense for the Palestinian position to have a lower ceiling than that of the US administration.</s> 

<s i="19">Many Palestinian analysts, in looking at Abbas' speech, considered it a denouncement of the US mediation approach.</s> <s i="20">This may provide the international community with an opportunity to revise that approach, which has been unfairly exploiting the imbalance of power and the weakness of the Palestinian side.</s>
