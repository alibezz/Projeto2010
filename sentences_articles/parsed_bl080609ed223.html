<s i="0">President Barack Obama's Cairo speech embodied the paradox of the modern age: the wealthiest, most powerful nation in the world is also the most idealistic.</s> <s i="1">One face of America is that of strength and confidence.</s> <s i="2">Obama displayed another face of America that is no less essential: that of humility, honesty and innocence.</s> 
<s i="3">&quot;All of us share this world for but a brief moment in time,&quot; Obama said.</s> <s i="4">&quot;The question is whether we spend that time focused on what pushes us apart, or whether we commit ourselves to a sustained effort to find common ground, to focus on the future we seek for our children, and to respect the dignity of all human beings.&quot;</s>
<s i="5">Why can't we all just get along?</s> <s i="6">Americans want to know.</s> <s i="7">This sort of &quot;innocents abroad&quot; approach was mixed with an apologetics, lavish praise for Islam and extreme moral juxtapositions--such as comparing the Holocaust to the suffering of Palestinians and placing Israel in the role of oppressors as in South Africa under apartheid or American blacks suffering the &quot;lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation&quot;.</s>
<s i="8">On the other hand, Obama had some blunt words for the Arab world: &quot;Palestinians must abandon violence. . . .</s> <s i="9">It is a sign of neither courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on a bus.</s> <s i="10">That is not how moral authority is claimed; that is how it is surrendered.</s> <s i="11">Now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build.&quot;</s>
<s i="12">And this: &quot;Finally, the Arab states must recognize that the Arab Peace Initiative was an important beginning, but not the end of their responsibilities.</s> <s i="13">The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems.</s> <s i="14">Instead, it must be a cause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state; to recognize Israel's legitimacy; and to choose progress over a self-defeating focus on the past.&quot;</s>
<s i="15">This is greatly understating the matter.</s> <s i="16">Since this was an opportunity to boldly tell the truth, he should have said to the Palestinians and the Arab states: &quot;The dream of a Palestinian state is in your hands.</s> <s i="17">It is the Arab world that has repeatedly rejected the partition of Palestine--in 1937, 1947, 1967 and 2000.</s> <s i="18">If the Arab world steps forward and accepts the legitimate right of the Jewish people to a state in their land alongside an independent Palestine, the people and government of Israel will embrace peace, as they did with Egypt and Jordan.&quot;</s>
<s i="19">Though Obama did not go that far, his call on the Arab states to do more could be an important step toward a more realistic policy.</s> <s i="20">Yet the speech was not really about policy, but more a pressing of a rhetorical &quot;reset&quot; button.</s> <s i="21">It is as if Obama has looked at the world and determined that what is lacking is inspiration, humility and vision.</s> <s i="22">He used the word &quot;mistrust&quot; four times.</s> <s i="23">Obama's proposed remedy: &quot;a sustained effort to listen to each other; to learn from each other; to respect one another; and to seek common ground.&quot;</s>
<s i="24">But the focus on trust is a misdiagnosis.</s> <s i="25">Would it were true that the world is suffering from a vast misunderstanding.</s> <s i="26">Totalitarian movements--such as Nazism, Communism, and Islamism--do not attack, kill, oppress and expand because of a lack of trust.</s> 
<s i="27">Obama comes from Chicago, a place that has suffered from organized crime.</s> <s i="28">Imagine that the mob controls half the city, imposing tremendous fear and poverty on millions of citizens.</s> <s i="29">Next imagine the mayor making a long-awaited foray into the heart of this troubled area and calling for a new start and a better way of life.</s> 
<s i="30">Before such a speech, the mobsters might have been worried that the mayor would take them on, and the people hopeful for the same reason.</s> <s i="31">But both sides would simply be mystified if the mayor came in and said, first, I'm not the mayor, second, sorry for bothering you and third, you really should stop fighting and behaving so badly--all without clearly mentioning the mobsters and sometimes even sounding like the people and mobsters were equally to blame.</s> 
<s i="32">The purpose of the Cairo speech, it seems, was to prove that the US means well.</s> <s i="33">Now, however, it will be harder than before for the US to prove that it means business.</s> <s i="34">In a mob-dominated neighborhood, the people only want to know one thing: is someone going to help us get rid of these thugs or not?</s> 
<s i="35">The danger is that moderate Arab leaders will take Obama's speech to mean 1) the pressure is off on us to liberalize and 2) we're on our own because Iran is going nuclear.</s> <s i="36">The Arab people will similarly conclude that America is retreating and will not stand with them against their sclerotic governments or the spread of Islamism.</s>
<s i="37">The only way Obama will convince them otherwise is if he suddenly shows that the US will put muscle behind its vision.</s> <s i="38">In an interview with Newsweek last month, Obama said of his outreach to Iran, &quot;if it doesn't work, the fact that we have tried will strengthen our position in mobilizing the international community,&quot; presumably to impose draconian sanctions on Iran.</s> <s i="39">This sort of stick was completely absent from the Cairo speech.</s>
