<s i="0">Hundreds of West Bank road obstructions prevent Palestinian freedom of movement.</s> <s i="1">Contrary to the prevailing &quot;wisdom&quot;, only a small fraction of these actually control entry into Israel; most create suffocating rings around Palestinian communities.</s> <s i="2">Some permanent &quot;checkpoints&quot;, located on roads from the main cities, are manned by the Israel Defense Forces, others by the Border Police.</s> <s i="3">The hurdles include high earthworks, deep ditches or concrete boulders, the closure of roads and dirt tracks, thereby preventing vehicular traffic in and out of villages, and &quot;rolling&quot; checkpoints that suddenly appear on the routes used by Palestinians.</s>

<s i="4">In recent years, many first class roads have been paved for settlers only--the apartheid roads.</s> <s i="5">The Palestinians move on separate, often unpaved and badly maintained roads.</s> <s i="6">Trips from a village to its nearby market town, which used to take minutes, now follow circuitous routes that add many kilometers and many hours.</s> <s i="7">Though these roads are traveled solely by Palestinians, the army nevertheless springs its rolling checkpoints even here, without prior notice.</s>

<s i="8">Palestinians leaving home for work, school or university, for medical care, shopping or other living essentials, never know whether they will actually reach their destination.</s> <s i="9">They no longer bother how long the journey will take: that is immaterial.</s> <s i="10">Even if they pass one checkpoint uneventfully, a second or a third one along the way can still send them back.</s> <s i="11">The reason is not always apparent.</s> <s i="12">Perhaps an event during the night, often at the IDF's initiative, maybe a warning about terrorists, can prevent the movement of an entire population, including sick people on their way to hospital and schoolchildren--with no conceivable link to the event.</s>

<s i="13">As if this arbitrary restriction of movement were not enough, beginning last December and so far extending into mid-January, a new decree has imposed &quot;quarantine&quot; on the northern West Bank: 800,000 Palestinians living in Jenin and Nablus districts are not permitted to travel south to Ramallah and Jerusalem.</s> <s i="14">A similar quarantine has long been in effect in the southern West Bank.</s> <s i="15">Some feel that the new ordinance was a logical follow through from the Gaza disengagement, with its hint of a tighter grip on the West Bank.</s> <s i="16">Whatever the case, the IDF has carved the West Bank into enclaves, preventing transit from area to area, turning each into a large prison where only the skies are open.</s> <s i="17">So absolute has been the decree that families were often barred from spending the recent Muslim holiday with relatives.</s>

<s i="18">The IDF's behavior in the West Bank and the collective punishment that it imposes are largely unknown to the Israeli public.</s> <s i="19">It has become easy to hide behind the contention that the IDF provides security to the people of Israel.</s> <s i="20">But some think differently.</s> <s i="21">Israeli women peace activists, members of MachsomWatch, decided to keep a closer eye on what was going on.</s> <s i="22">Opposed to the continuation of the occupation and its concomitant oppression of the Palestinians, these women have gone deep into the West Bank for almost five years, in two shifts a day in all weather, to document what happens at more than 30 checkpoints and on the roads leading to them.</s> <s i="23">In recent weeks, the women who go to locations around Nablus have uncovered an embargo on entry into Nablus by inhabitants of the Tulkarm district.</s> <s i="24">MachsomWatch shifts have asserted for some weeks now that Nablus residents are not allowed to travel southward, through the Zaatra junction that controls the road to Ramallah.</s> <s i="25">The women have documented constant, sudden &quot;stoppages of life&quot; at Huwwara south of Nablus, where hundreds of men, women and children are crowded together in bitter cold, in a long line waiting to pass, maybe after an hour, maybe more, through the checkpoint.</s> <s i="26">Alongside them, a similarly long line of vehicles waits its turn.</s> <s i="27">The claim, as always, is security: warning of a terrorist supposedly trying to sneak by on his or her way to strike at Israel.</s>

<s i="28">It is difficult to know whether the &quot;quarantine&quot; was decided upon after deliberation by the political echelon.</s> <s i="29">Perhaps, as often before, the decree originated in the security hierarchy of the General Security Service (Shabak) or IDF Central Command.</s>
