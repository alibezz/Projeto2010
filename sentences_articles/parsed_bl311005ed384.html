<s i="0">James Wolfensohn seems to understand well the inextricable link between politics and economics.</s> <s i="1">His 10-year tenure as president of the World Bank, a job he held until his present appointment as the Quartet's envoy to coordinate the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, has obviously taught him how tangible improvements in economic conditions in conflict-ridden areas can help solve political problems.</s> <s i="2">Palestine is no strange place for Wolfensohn, and it is definitely not an exception to this fact.</s>
 

<s i="3">In an economy that has, over that past five years, lost a third of its output (GDP), 40 percent of its per capita income, two-thirds of its private investment, and more than half of its exports; and, as a result, left two-thirds of the population poor and over a third of its workforce jobless; in such an economy, something has to happen to change the downward trend to help provide hope and create a different environment conducive to dealing with all outstanding political issues.</s> <s i="4">Wolfensohn seems to understand the devastating impact of the Israeli closure policy and of the restrictions imposed on movement of Palestinian trade and people.</s> <s i="5">He has devoted most of his time over the past few months since he took this job to mediate between the parties to reach mutually agreed solutions.</s>


<s i="6">Wolfensohn posited a &quot;six plus three&quot; agenda, which is basically a combination of several outstanding items related to access (i.e., border crossings between the Palestinian areas and Israel, territorial link between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, internal closures in the West Bank, the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, and the seaport and airport in Gaza), internal Palestinian matters (including governance and fiscal discipline), and a couple of &quot;leftover&quot; items in the ex-settlements areas (mainly the rubble from demolished  settlements and the greenhouses).</s> <s i="7">A satisfactory resolution to all of these issues is indispensable for economic recovery in the Palestinian areas, and a prerequisite for any progress in the conflict.</s>


<s i="8">The issue of border crossings with Israel is mainly related to the need to introduce new and modern technology, upgrading infrastructure on both sides of the border, and, most importantly, adopting a different management system that is written, monitored and agreed to by the parties, all in order to gradually move away from, and eventually dismantle, the present outdated, time consuming and costly &quot;back-to-back&quot; system and replace it with a &quot;door-to-door&quot; system whereby Palestinian interests in fast and free cargo crossing are adequately met without compromising Israeli security concerns.</s>


<s i="9">In Rafah, at the Gaza-Egypt border, the issue is somewhat different.</s> <s i="10">The Palestinian position is that in post-disengagement Gaza, the Palestinian side should have full functional control over their side of the terminal and allow goods and people to cross without a physical Israeli presence, but with the help of a third party to monitor the operation to ensure effective conduct and compliance with the terms of the semi-customs union arrangements with Israel (i.e., the terms of the Paris protocol).</s> <s i="11">The Israeli position is entirely different.</s> <s i="12">The Israeli government initially wanted to move the border crossing further south; about three kilometers from its current location, to a tri-border-point called Kerem Shalom (or Karm Abu Salem in Arabic) at the Palestinian-Israeli-Egyptian border, in order to maintain its total control over the entry and exit of both people and goods.</s> <s i="13">This, the Israeli government said, is essential to preserve the customs union arrangement with Gaza.</s>
 

<s i="14">A compromise is currently in the making between all concerned parties (the Palestinian side, Israel, Egypt and the Wolfensohn team) whereby passengers entering and leaving Gaza will be allowed to use the present terminal at Rafah, monitored by a third party, without any Israeli physical presence, while cargo trade transaction to and from Gaza will be conducted through the Kerem Shalom border crossing currently under construction.</s> <s i="15">The details of this deal are expected to be finalized and made public within a short period of time, barring any last minute surprises.</s>


<s i="16">As regards the abandoned settlements and their infrastructure, before the Israeli settlers were removed from Gaza, an estimated 4,000 greenhouses were operating, mainly in the ex-Gush Qatif settlement bloc.</s> <s i="17">About 2,500 of these greenhouses were left behind as a result of a financial deal reached with the settlers.</s> <s i="18">Some greenhouses were left in good condition, others were damaged to varying degrees.</s> <s i="19">The Palestinian side has allocated $34 million of its own money and established the Palestinian agriculture development company to make use of the greenhouses.</s> <s i="20">At present, 1,500 greenhouses have been replanted and about 2,000 jobs were created.</s> <s i="21">So far, so good.</s> <s i="22">But the future of this enterprise lies in the hands of the Israeli side.</s> <s i="23">Seedlings, fertilizers, and pesticide come from Israel.</s> <s i="24">Energy and water needs all depend on Israeli supplies.</s> <s i="25">The first harvest season is fast approaching (November 20), and exports of produce need a quick exit to consumers in Europe.</s> <s i="26">If fast, unfettered access is not guaranteed through border crossings, we will be faced with a serious problem.</s> <s i="27">So far, there have been no assurances of any kind.</s> <s i="28">This illustrates how crucial the access issue is for the future of any business in Gaza.</s>


<s i="29">Despite previous understandings that Israel will pay for the removal of the rubble and help secure an exit for materials deemed hazardous, no agreement has yet been reached between Israel and the UNDP, which is entrusted with overseeing and administering the removal of the rubble.</s> <s i="30">The delay in resolving this sensitive issue is troubling to say the least.</s> <s i="31">No major development of the evacuated areas can be implemented until the issue is resolved.</s>


<s i="32">As for the future use of land and future development projects in the evacuated settlements, we just began a serious discussion with the World Bank to see how best this land could be used to serve the needs of both the present population and the needs of the future generations.</s> <s i="33">The reacquisition of this land after 38 years of occupation is a major asset for the Palestinian side, and we intend to do everything possible to use it optimally.</s> <s i="34">Development of the evacuated areas in the northern West Bank is a different matter, and largely depends on whether this land will remain outside the domain of the PA (i.e., continue to be classified as Area C).</s>  


<s i="35">The international community has expressed its willingness to provide financial and technical assistance to develop the Palestinian economy, not just the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="36">The G-8 meeting last summer pledged up to three billion dollars a year over the next three years for that task.</s> <s i="37">Last May, upon a request by Wolfensohn, the PA prepared a &quot;Quick Impact Program&quot; that included 35 projects covering a wide spectrum of areas (water, energy, housing, education, governance, private sector, etc.).</s> <s i="38">A total of $750 million has been committed and will continue to be disbursed to fund some of these projects until the end of this year.</s>


<s i="39">There has been no progress whatsoever on the issues of a Gaza sea- and airport or the Gaza-West Bank link.</s> <s i="40">This is partly because all attention over the past few weeks has been centered on resolving the Rafah border crossing question, and partly because of the more-than-usual tenuous security situation that has prevailed since September 12.</s> <s i="41">But the real reason, in my own assessment, is that Israel has never shown any genuine interest in seriously discussing these crucial access issues.</s> <s i="42">Israeli policy here seems to be dictated entirely by the terms of its unilateral disengagement plan, which preclude any possibility that someday the Palestinian side may have its own international gateway to connect to the rest of the world or to have a real, direct and secure link between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.</s> <s i="43">On this last point, it is interesting to note that the Israeli disengagement plan does not include any reference to such a link, and that Israel has recently asked the World Bank and USAID to stop funding a study aimed at examining the best options for connecting the two parts of the Palestinian territory.</s>


<s i="44">In Wolfensohn's own estimate, adequate progress has not yet been achieved on any one of these issues.</s> <s i="45">Wolfensohn's frustration over the lack of tangible outcomes was made clear in his letter of October 17 addressed to the foreign ministers of the Quartet and to the Palestinian and the Israeli leaders.</s> <s i="46">In the letter, Wolfensohn basically warned all parties of the potential adverse consequences of continued procrastination regarding taking hard decisions to advance the issues.</s>
 

<s i="47">Wolfensohn's frustration is mainly targeted at Israel due to its slow handling of the serious proposals submitted by the World Bank and by his own team to find ways by which restrictions on the movement of people and goods can be relaxed, allowing more internal access within the Palestinian areas, and faster and less costly Palestinian trade with Israel and the outside world, without risking Israeli security interest in the process.</s> <s i="48">His frustration comes basically out of the belief that continued restrictions will prevent any chance for economic recovery, thus opening the door for more deterioration in the economic conditions in years to come, with the grave attendant consequences of further deepening social and security rifts in Palestinian society, and complicating any real chance of finding a way out of this bloody conflict.</s>


<s i="49">On the Palestinian side, and although there is a need to seriously address and confront the present chaotic environment in the Palestinian areas, it is important to realize that as long as the economic crisis continues, there is a limit to how much the PA can do.</s> <s i="50">Both the present security situation and the feeble fiscal stance to which Wolfensohn referred in his recent letter to the Quartet, are a natural outcome of the sharp economic plunge that started five years ago as the product of the stringent and draconian Israeli measures that suffocated the Palestinian economy.</s>
