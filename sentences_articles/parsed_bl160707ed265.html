<s i="0">Ever since he was elected to head the Palestinian Authority (PA) in January 2005 there has been a recurrent din about the &quot;need to strengthen&quot;</s> <s i="1">Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen).</s> <s i="2">The US administration has been broadly supportive of such an endeavor, but Israeli officials have consistently described him as &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;ineffectual&quot;.</s>

<s i="3">Since the takeover of Gaza by Hamas in mid-June, the &quot;need to strengthen Abbas&quot; has grown to a clamor.</s> <s i="4">The essential question then revolves around the sources of the weaknesses or strengths of Abu Mazen.</s>

<s i="5">Since the platform Abbas ran on in the presidential elections was known to all (no to armed resistance, yes to negotiations), for a whole year after he was elected and until Hamas came to power in the parliamentary elections of January 2006 it was Israeli policies that weakened him.</s> 

<s i="6">For example, the release of a sizable number of political prisoners in this time could have been an important goodwill gesture and would have created a positive resonance among Palestinians given the centrality of the issue for a broad sector of the public.</s> <s i="7">But instead the wall continued to be built, more roadblocks and hindrances to free access to land increased, land confiscation continued and there was no progress in &quot;negotiations&quot;.</s> 

<s i="8">It is generally agreed among Palestinian analysts that there are two main factors that led to Hamas' victory in the parliamentary elections: corruption in PA quarters and the lack of progress toward what Fateh calls the &quot;National Project&quot;, that is the two-state solution as understood by Palestinians.</s> <s i="9">It is also generally agreed that had there been credible political progress and improvement in economic conditions, Hamas would not have done so well.</s> 

<s i="10">The fact of the matter is that there has been no political process to speak of since the breakdown of the Camp David talks in July 2000.</s> <s i="11">Former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's &quot;disengagement&quot; plan was in fact meant to fill the vacuum created by the lack of such a process, and without negotiations with the Palestinian side.</s>

<s i="12">It should be clear that for the last seven years, various Israeli governments have been avoiding any serious political process.</s> <s i="13">One reason for that is the fact that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has become a domestic Israeli issue, given the lack of external pressure on Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian land.</s> <s i="14">Israel as a state has been far too successful in warding-off external pressure, largely due to the influence of the Israel lobby on the US Congress and the US administration, especially under President George W. Bush.</s>

<s i="15">As a result, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has turned into a &quot;political football&quot; to be tossed around by various Israeli political parties.</s> <s i="16">Electoral and domestic factors predominate and politicians outbid each other in showing that they are not soft on &quot;security&quot;.</s>

<s i="17">The &quot;security first&quot; route has been the undoing of the Oslo process especially since what Israel is willing to &quot;give&quot;</s> <s i="18">Palestinians at the end of any similar process, no Palestinian leader with any credibility can accept.</s> <s i="19">This is due to the fact that Israeli domestic politics has become the main arbiter on how to end the conflict.</s>
