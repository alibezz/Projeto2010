<s i="0">There appear to be a number of possible explanations why the Palestinian Authority could collapse into anarchy.</s> <s i="1">Some observers argue that the Palestinians have proven themselves essentially ungovernable and uniquely inclined to make all the wrong decisions at the national level.</s> <s i="2">Others that Israel and its occupation, directly and indirectly, are the primary catalyst of chaos.</s> <s i="3">Still others fault the Oslo accords for generating a bad solution for Palestinian needs.</s> 

<s i="4">The school of thought informing and justifying the drive to impose the harshest possible economic sanctions on the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority argues, in a Leninist fashion, that the worse things get in Palestine, the better they will eventually become.</s> <s i="5">In other words, economic chaos will breed social, political and security chaos, bring down the Hamas government and produce something better in its place.</s> <s i="6">To its credit the Olmert government, though inheriting the mantle of a policy that certainly contributed to the Palestinians' current plight, does not subscribe to this all-out approach.</s> <s i="7">Together with the Quartet, it is now looking for ways to spend Palestinian monies and donor funds for the benefit of Palestinians, somehow hoping that this will prevent starvation and chaos but also not help Hamas solidify its rule.</s>

<s i="8">The principal external actors, then, don't want a total collapse of the PA: only a partial collapse--enough to either discredit and replace Hamas or oblige it to moderate its attitude toward Israel, violence and a two-state solution.</s> <s i="9">But one way or another, because we are dealing with an unprecedented situation in the annals of the conflict--indeed, in the annals of the modern Middle East--and because the economic and security situation in the West Bank and particularly Gaza is deteriorating rapidly, collapse is possible.</s> <s i="10">Nor can we safely predict what &quot;collapse&quot; would look like: a Somalia-like situation, a Hamas-Fateh civil war, or genuine socio-economic distress in a political void.</s> <s i="11">At a minimum, it would be characterized by a severe setback for Palestinian democracy and large-scale human suffering.</s>

<s i="12">This is bad news for Palestinians.</s> <s i="13">But the potential consequences of collapse for those outside Palestine are also likely to be highly negative.</s> <s i="14">First, the distress inside Palestine would generate unrest and agitation among large Palestinian populations living next door, in Israel and Jordan.</s> <s i="15">This could have political consequences in both countries, particularly the Hashemite kingdom.</s> <s i="16">Inside Palestine the situation would invite extremism, including Islamic extremism led by Hizballah and al-Qaeda, both of whom have already been targeting and infiltrating the Palestinian conflict.</s> <s i="17">This would affect the security situation among Palestine's neighbors.</s>

<s i="18">Second, whatever remains (following the counterproductive elections in Iraq and Palestine) of the American democratic reform drive in the Arab world would be further discredited, having proven itself selective, anti-Islamic and ultimately destructive.</s> <s i="19">The consequences for US Middle East policy would be felt as far afield as Morocco and Iraq.</s> <s i="20">Moderate Arab reformers in those countries and in Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia, a small but important group of embattled secular democrats, would also be disgraced.</s>

<s i="21">Assuming orderly governance was not quickly restored, Israel would come under heavy pressure from some international and domestic circles to, in effect, renew military government in order to stem the chaos and provide sustenance.</s> <s i="22">Alternatively, or in parallel, pressure would increase for an &quot;international solution&quot; involving both foreign military forces and a major donor effort.</s> <s i="23">Egypt and Jordan, which have thus far maintained their distance both politically and militarily, might now be called upon, against their better judgment, to play a major role.</s>

<s i="24">Could something good also emerge from a collapse of governance in Palestine?</s> <s i="25">Theoretically, it is possible that an alliance of Fateh-oriented strongmen (at least two; one for Gaza, one for the West Bank) could, with a little help from Israel, take over and even strike a peace deal that satisfies all of Jerusalem's territorial and national needs.</s> <s i="26">Yet judging by the course of Palestinian history and the mood of the Palestinian street, this is highly unlikely.</s>
