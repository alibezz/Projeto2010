<s i="0">The Annapolis summit meeting of late November concluded with an agreement to implement a two track approach.</s> <s i="1">The first track is negotiations on a permanent status agreement; the second is implementation of the first phase of the roadmap: ending terror and violence, normalizing Palestinian life and building Palestinian institutions.</s> <s i="2">Implementation of any agreement concluded in the first track is conditioned on successful implementation of the second track.</s> <s i="3">Here we examine the status of implementation of the security commitments of the first phase of the roadmap.</s>

<s i="4">According to the roadmap, the Palestinians have to &quot;declare an unequivocal end to violence and terrorism and undertake visible efforts on the ground to arrest, disrupt and restrain individuals and groups conducting and planning violent attacks on Israelis anywhere&quot;.</s> <s i="5">A &quot;rebuilt and refocused Palestinian Authority security apparatus&quot; has to begin &quot;sustained, targeted and effective operations aimed at confronting all those engaged in terror and dismantlement of terrorist capabilities and infrastructure.</s> <s i="6">This includes commencing confiscation of illegal weapons and consolidation of security authority, free of association with terror and corruption.&quot;</s>

<s i="7">The Palestinian Authority is far from implementing these obligations.</s> <s i="8">An effort was made to improve the capabilities of the Palestinian security apparatus with resources and training provided by the US, the European Union, Jordan and Egypt.</s> <s i="9">The success of this effort was very modest; PA security forces manifested their poor performance when they failed to prevent the takeover of the Gaza Strip in May 2007.</s> 

<s i="10">This means that the PA's security apparatus cannot operate at all in the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="11">In the West Bank its performance is marginally better.</s> <s i="12">The Fayyad government has utilized some newly-trained forces to take control of limited parts of the West Bank.</s> <s i="13">The most notable case is Nablus, where the PA deployed some 300 police officers to instill law and order and their presence has restored some stability and public order in a city that was in an anarchical situation, ruled by warlords and armed gangs.</s> 


<s i="14">However, there are two problems with this operation.</s> <s i="15">First, the PA has exhausted its ability to instill law and order in other places due to a shortage of trained forces and because cities like Hebron are still in a situation of complete security havoc.</s> <s i="16">Second, the force in Nablus is engaged solely in public security, i.e., fighting common crime.</s> <s i="17">It doesn't confront those engaged in terror and doesn't dismantle terrorist capabilities and infrastructure.</s> 


<s i="18">True, there are some attempts to dismantle Hamas infrastructure as part of the internal conflict between Fateh and Hamas, but no attempts are made to dismantle armed groups not associated with Hamas by arresting, disrupting and restraining them.</s> <s i="19">The PA force has tried to dismantle some of these groups by mediating an agreement between them and Israel, according to which Israel pardons these people and they give up their weapons and commit not to participate in terror.</s>
 

<s i="20">This initiative has had some success but its capacity to produce better results is constrained by the lack of a sustained campaign against those not willing to participate in the agreement.</s> 
<s i="21">The main problem for the PA, other than its limited security capabilities, is its reluctance to operate against those perceived by the population as freedom fighters.</s> <s i="22">Mahmoud Abbas and others in the PA are willing to make general declarations that denounce violence but are not willing to engage in open and clear activities against groups involved in terror.</s> <s i="23">As a result, recent terror activities featured involvement of personnel from the security apparatus itself.</s> <s i="24">Those involved in these actions preferred to turn themselves in to the PA because they thought they would thereby be sheltered from Israeli arrest and because they knew they would be indicted for light offenses such as hurting the interests of the PA rather than for murder.</s>



<s i="25">Israel's security obligations under the first phase of the roadmap are not to take &quot;actions undermining trust, including deportations, attacks on civilians; confiscation and/or demolition of Palestinian homes and property, as a punitive measure or to facilitate Israeli construction; destruction of Palestinian institutions and infrastructure; and other measures specified in the Tenet work plan&quot;.</s> <s i="26">As comprehensive security performance moves forward, the IDF is supposed to withdraw progressively from areas occupied since September 28, 2000.</s> 


<s i="27">Israel has generally stopped deportations, confiscation and demolition of Palestinian homes and properties, although some property is still confiscated for public needs such as road building.</s> <s i="28">Israel is not attacking civilians intentionally although some collateral damage occurs.</s> <s i="29">Destruction of Palestinian institutions and infrastructure has stopped in the West Bank.</s> <s i="30">In the Gaza Strip fighting continues, including destruction of infrastructure.</s> 



<s i="31">Nevertheless, it is not possible to determine that Israel is refraining from undertaking actions undermining trust because Israel is continuing its sustained anti-terror operations all over the West Bank, and these lead to arrests and Palestinian casualties, including in areas like Nablus after the deployment of the Palestinian police.</s> <s i="32">This badly undermines the legitimacy of the PA security apparatus among Palestinians.</s> <s i="33">Therefore the return to the September 28, 2000 lines is not the issue.</s> <s i="34">The sore point is the activities of Israel's forces and not their deployment.</s>
