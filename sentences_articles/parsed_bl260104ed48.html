<s i="0">Let's be frank: corruption is found the world over.</s> <s i="1">Where corruption makes world headlines, however, is in those parts of the world where there is intense international scrutiny, and especially in regions where accusations of corruption are used for political machinations.</s> <s i="2">This is certainly the case in Israel and Palestine.</s> <s i="3">Added to the mix is the fact that Israel and Palestine collectively receive an immense amount of foreign aid per capita.</s> <s i="4">Donor countries are obviously keen on preventing the misuse and squandering of their funds.</s> 

<s i="5">The first Palestinian government or authority is only ten years old, but that short life span has been characterized by an inordinate amount of discussion and debate over the issue of corruption and reform.</s> <s i="6">This focus comes from three directions: Palestinian watchdogs and governmental individuals and organizations, the donors and international community, and finally, Israel.</s> 

<s i="7">The issue of corruption was first raised in Palestine in 1995 when the Palestinian comptroller evaluated the performance of different ministries in the Palestinian Authority and described specific irregularities.</s> <s i="8">The Palestinian Legislative Council then followed up with its infamous &quot;corruption report&quot; which offered a thorough and detailed evaluation, indicating weaknesses, malfunction, and sometimes outright fraud.</s> <s i="9">This report was widely published and debated in forums, newspapers and other public venues.</s> <s i="10">In the end, the open public debate led to the resignation of that cabinet and a reshuffle--although the changes did not necessarily allow for serious reform and correction of the problems that had been reviewed by the Legislative Council.</s> 

<s i="11">Later, quiet but efficient pressure began to come from the donor community, particularly from Europe.</s> <s i="12">This pressure was doled out in a constructive manner, to try to convince the Palestinian Authority to initiate a reform process.</s> <s i="13">The big push came only when the United States adopted a pointed negative political attitude towards the Palestinian Authority and began to promote the idea of &quot;regime change&quot; in Palestine.</s> <s i="14">The United States then began to use the issue of corruption as a tool with which to attack the Palestinian Authority, thus manipulating calls for reform in order to bring about political change.</s> <s i="15">The Americans had a set political agenda and they were ready to use any means, including the case for reform, to pursue that agenda.</s> <s i="16">The most cynical analysis would point today to the ongoing allegations of corruption against high-ranking members of the Israeli government and the deafening silence from the international community on those charges.</s>

<s i="17">All of these factors materialized in the now-famous speech of President Yasser Arafat before the Legislative Council in May 2002.</s> <s i="18">In that speech, the president admitted mistakes, took responsibility for them, and promised change in the future.</s> <s i="19">Then he ordered a cabinet reshuffle that included new faces.</s> <s i="20">One outcome of this new cabinet was the &quot;one hundred day program for reform&quot; and a ministerial reform committee that produced some positive results.</s> 

<s i="21">Still, the charge of corruption remains a major means of &quot;managing&quot; this political conflict on the part of the Americans and Israelis.</s> <s i="22">Just look at the issue of elections.</s> <s i="23">In his important June 2002 policy speech, President George W. Bush declared that Palestinian elections would be held in six months.</s> <s i="24">His motives were to counteract a successful Israeli campaign of discrediting the Palestinian Authority by restoring the confidence of the Palestinian public.</s> <s i="25">Not knowing enough about Palestinian internal affairs, the Americans assumed that elections would also lead to a change in the Palestinian leadership, thus furthering their own stated interests.</s> <s i="26">It was not long before Israel advised the US that elections would only renew the leadership of President Arafat and suddenly, the Americans were opposing their own policy.</s>

<s i="27">Palestinians have not been able to ignore this manipulation of what, for them, is a real and urgent concern.</s> <s i="28">It is very interesting to note that even as the United States and Israel have used the issue of reform to further their own political interests, Palestinians have pursued a reform agenda on their own terms as a means of enhancing and improving the political position of the Palestinian Authority and their leadership, for the benefit of both the Palestinian public and the international community.</s> <s i="29">For Palestinians, reform has been a means of showing faith in their chosen leaders.</s>

<s i="30">The conclusion here is that different parties approach corruption in different ways.</s> <s i="31">Some of them, including Israel and the United States, have been manipulating the issue of corruption and its solutions in order to pursue specific political agendas, while others, among them Palestinian groups in power  (such as the Legislative Council and certain political figures), the Palestinian opposition and local civil society, European Union bodies and independent organizations, have approached the issue of corruption and reform with a genuine reform agenda.</s> 

<s i="32">A great deal has been achieved in the Palestinian Authority to arrive at a nearly complete end to financial corruption and a fruitful and promising process of reforming other aspects of the judiciary and the civil service.</s> <s i="33">Unfortunately, this process has been stunted by the continuation of Israel's reoccupation of Palestinian cities and the subsequent economic deterioration resulting from Israel's collective punishment.</s>
