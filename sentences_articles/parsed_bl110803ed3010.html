<s i="0">Judging by the number of statements made by United States President George W. Bush regarding the separation fence, or &quot;wall&quot; as he termed it a while ago, one might conclude that this is one of the central problems confronting American foreign policy.</s> <s i="1">Indeed, based on the diplomatic and media interest displayed in the fence in western Europe, we could assume that this is one of the central problems of the world.</s>

<s i="2">We recall that the primary impetus for constructing the fence came from the Israeli political left.</s> <s i="3">Beyond enhancing security, the left had two principal objectives: 1) once again to separate the State of Israel from Judea and Samaria, and thereby to ensure that in Judea and Samaria there would arise a Palestinian state; and 2) to isolate the settlers, to cause them to feel &quot;beyond the fence&quot;--a loaded term from the standpoint of Jewish history, meaning removal from the community--so their will would break and they would abandon the settlements, or at least the more distant and isolated ones.</s>

<s i="4">We also recall that, for precisely the same reasons that the left supported the fence, the settlers opposed it.</s> <s i="5">But they had a problem: they feared lest their opposition be interpreted as sectorial selfishness--as if, in order to prevent the political fallout from the fence, they were ready to detract from the overall security of Israelis, most of whom, including supporters of the settlers, saw in the fence a genuine source of salvation.</s> <s i="6">Indeed, the Yesha Council (Council of the Communities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza) took a position contrary to that of the majority of residents of the ideological settlements, and ceased opposing the fence.</s> <s i="7">Notably, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon initially opposed the fence for the same reasons as the settlers.</s> <s i="8">But he changed his position under massive pressure from a panicky public, orchestrated by the media with its decisive leftist influence.</s>

<s i="9">The separation fence does not lie precisely on the green line, as the left and the Palestinians wanted.</s> <s i="10">In at least one area, Ariel, it is planned to curve some 20 kilometers deep into the region that they, along with their Israeli and American supporters, see as the future Palestinian state.</s> <s i="11">Not surprisingly, this has turned the tables: the left and the front organizations it generated to &quot;push&quot; the fence (e.g., regional councils comprising villages connected organizationally directly to the Labor Party, various non-governmental organizations, etc.) have now begun to follow the American lead and oppose the fence.</s> <s i="12">After all, America is the source of authority; its plans, such as the roadmap, are supported by the left, which depends mainly on American pressure in order to realize its political schemes.</s>

<s i="13">Yet it is on the right, particularly among the settlers, that the more dramatic turnabout has taken place.</s> <s i="14">The settlers' support for the fence has evolved from ex post facto tactical acquiescence to something approaching strategic support.</s> <s i="15">Their detractors, including the analysts of Israeli affairs in the intelligence and foreign offices of Europe and the United States, can now draw far-reaching conclusions:

First, Sharon's fence, the fence that has provoked such strong protest from the president, the Palestinians and the Israeli left, leaves under Palestinian sovereignty large portions of the historic Land of Israel.</s>

<s i="16">Secondly, the settlers' support for the current course of the fence ostensibly proves, at least judging by the policy of their representative body, the Yesha Council, that at the deepest ideological level the primary motivation for the massive settlement movement of the past three decades--maintaining the territory of the Land of Israel under the sovereignty of the State of Israel--is no longer the central objective.</s>

<s i="17">Accordingly, preserving the settlement status quo, i.e., the existence of the settlements, is from herein the central goal of the Yesha Council.</s>

<s i="18">On Sunday, August 10, Israel's activist foreign minister, Sylvan Shalom, announced that &quot;even friends can disagree&quot; and that Israel, despite considerable American opposition, &quot;will continue to build the separation fence as planned.&quot;</s> <s i="19">Here the Sharon government's objectives dovetail with those of the settlers, who have a realistic assessment of its ability to maneuver.</s> <s i="20">The government cannot and perhaps does not wish to challenge the Americans regarding the roadmap, i.e., concerning the establishment of a Palestinian state.</s> <s i="21">Regarding the fence, on the other hand, the government is prepared for a confrontation.</s> <s i="22">The reason: most voters, worn down by the past three years' vicious terrorist war, will support it over the fence, even if this means confrontation with America--but will not support confrontation over a Palestinian state.</s> <s i="23">Perhaps, too, someone senior in the Israeli government knows that regarding the fence, despite the harsh exchanges, the Americans will not enter into all-out confrontation with Israel.</s>

<s i="24">The important issue for the administration is the roadmap.</s> <s i="25">If it can be implemented, the American taxpayer will in any case have to fork out tens of billions of dollars.</s> <s i="26">So it makes little difference if two or three billion are added to cover the cost of dismantling the present fence and building a new one--a fence that follows the course of the border which, the Americans calculate, will be agreed upon in accordance with the roadmap.</s>
