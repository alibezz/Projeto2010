<s i="0">Just a few months ago, a number of observers were ready to pronounce the intifada �over� as it neared the end of its fifth and least violent year.</s> <s i="1">Now it appears that a sixth year of some sort may be in the offing, with the relative quiet of recent months ascribed at least in part to the disengagement and to a temporary internal Palestinian political truce.</s> <s i="2">In the latest spiral of violence, Hamas and Islamic Jihad took the lead in both the West Bank and Gaza, and Israel reacted with disproportionate counter-violence in the hope of weakening Hamas, sending a message that it did not leave Gaza out of weakness, and establishing a deterrent against further violence.</s> <s i="3">Israel also now encounters a Hamas with political aspirations--a byproduct of that movement�s relative success (compared to Fateh) both militarily and in societal terms in the past five years.</s>

<s i="4">This evolving situation only underlines the single positive achievement of the past five years: the unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip and northern West Bank.</s> <s i="5">Disengagement is good news, but its advent merely reflects the fact that the roadmap, the sole international political initiative of the intifada years to which disengagement was in many ways a reaction, was stillborn.</s> <s i="6">Indeed, from Camp David II via the roadmap to disengagement we have narrowed our horizons, in the course of these years, from a conflict resolution mode to little more than conflict management.</s>

<s i="7">Five years of intifada appear to have persuaded a majority of Israelis to readjust their strategic outlook: to prefer demography to geography, unilateralism to negotiations, strategic consolidation to strategic depth.</s> <s i="8">At the tactical military level, too, these five years have produced innovations.</s> <s i="9">On the part of the Palestinian side these comprised waves of suicide bombings and of Qassam rockets.</s> <s i="10">The suicide bombings, in turn, provided the impetus for Israeli security innovations: the fence that has been remarkably successful in curbing the bombings, and targeted assassinations, a collection of highly sophisticated techniques that have been improved so as to radically reduce bystander casualties, and that succeeded, albeit temporarily, in decapitating the terrorist leadership.</s> <s i="11">Both Israeli tactics, however necessary and successful, can do little more than contain the conflict, and have proven problematic from the moral and humanitarian standpoints.</s> <s i="12">Moreover, Israel still has no effective defensive measure against the Qassams, and has now opted to reply in kind, with artillery--an escalatory measure.</s>

<s i="13">The causal link is not only between Palestinian terrorism and Israeli military innovation, but between terror and political innovation, too--between the suicide bombings and Israel�s newfound reliance on the unilateral measures of both the fence and disengagement.</s> <s i="14">Coupled with the Israeli public�s disillusion after the collapse of the peace process, the suicide bombings appear to have persuaded a majority of Israelis that, first, the Palestinians are not a viable peace partner, and second, Israel has to create a physical distance between itself and them without a peace process, i.e., by unilateral means.</s> <s i="15">This dynamic evolved in the course of the past five years in a totally unscripted way: Palestinian beliefs to the contrary, there was no conspiracy, and the prime minister was dragged into it unwillingly by an anxious and insistent Israeli public.</s>
