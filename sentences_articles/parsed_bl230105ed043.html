<s i="0">Wednesday's elections are something all Palestinians should be proud of.</s> <s i="1">The process itself and the fact that voting will be held in spite of extremely difficult circumstances are both significant achievements.</s> 

<s i="2">Yet, the elections are in danger of becoming a distraction, and it almost seems that the Palestinian factions have forgotten the bigger picture.</s> 

<s i="3">The reality is that the campaigning and sloganeering we have been hearing in these elections is often far removed from the concerns of ordinary Palestinians.</s> <s i="4">Out in the villages, while maintaining our rights in Jerusalem is certainly something all agree with and support, villagers on a daily basis must grapple with immediate issues, such as the felling of trees by Israeli settlers and soldiers, or the wall being built, either on top of people's lands or separating people from their lands.</s> 

<s i="5">Israel is not changing any of its policies.</s> <s i="6">On the contrary: Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz is talking about holding on to the whole area east of Jerusalem, including the monstrous Maaleh Adumim settlement bloc, and with it the surrounding villages and their land.</s> <s i="7">Settlers continue rampaging at will.</s> <s i="8">Witness what has happened recently in Itamar, near Nablus, or in Hebron.</s> 

<s i="9">The Israeli army continues its incursions and arrests.</s> <s i="10">Not far from the polling stations and their international monitors, Israeli soldiers Sunday raided the village of Kharbata, west of Ramallah, to arrest several people.</s> <s i="11">Public announcements notwithstanding, there is nothing to stop Israel from continuing this throughout elections.</s>

<s i="12">Then there are the checkpoints.</s> <s i="13">Of all the Israeli practices in this intifada, the policy of closures has probably been the ugliest.</s> <s i="14">All the villages west of Ramallah, for example, are separated from their hinterland by the Nabi Saleh gate, a gate that can be opened or closed at the whim of a soldier.</s> <s i="15">People in the northern West Bank are not allowed to travel south.</s> 

<s i="16">For the purposes of elections, ballot boxes are placed in all villages.</s> <s i="17">And while it is unlikely that Israel, under international scrutiny, will interfere with these ballot boxes, once people have cast their votes, they still have to go and stand at a checkpoint hoping for the good graces of an Israeli soldier to be allowed to pass to tend to their lands or visit relatives.</s>

<s i="18">The occupation, in other words, and all the oppressive practices that stem from it, continues.</s> <s i="19">And this is the political context in which elections are held and which the factions seem in danger of losing sight of.</s> <s i="20">Even Hamas, for all its talk of Islamic lands, was at one point willing to proceed with elections without the participation of Jerusalemites.</s> 

<s i="21">Everybody wants a bite of a cake that doesn't exist.</s> 

<s i="22">That, of course, is not to say that elections are not important and will not effect any change.</s> <s i="23">These elections have sent a clear signal to Israel and the world, that all Palestinian factions are now prepared to accept to build a state on the territory occupied in1967.</s> <s i="24">It is illustrative to contrast Palestinian election slogans with Israeli ones.</s> <s i="25">All Palestinian factions are competing with themselves to say how much they want peace and security in an independent state.</s> <s i="26">Across the board that has been the message.</s>

<s i="27">Israeli parties, by contrast, are practically falling over themselves to show how tough they will be.</s> <s i="28">Israeli politics is defined by fanaticism and belligerence toward Palestinians.</s> 

<s i="29">With even Hamas talking about a decades long hudna, these elections show that the equation has changed.</s> <s i="30">Israel must show that it understands this.</s> <s i="31">The most immediate means to do so would be to ease closures and remove checkpoints.</s> <s i="32">When people from Nablus and Jenin are able to come to Ramallah unhindered, real progress can be felt.</s>
