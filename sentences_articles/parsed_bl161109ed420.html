<s i="0">US President Barack Obama learned too late that if you pressure a right-wing Israeli prime minister--for example, as we saw last Monday, merely by refusing to see him until the last minute and then preventing media coverage of the meeting--he'll arrive in a heavy sweat, then fall over himself making peace commitments.</s> <s i="1">Had a few of these traditional forms of pressure been invoked by Obama half a year ago, when Netanyahu's coalition was just forming and none of its members would have risked their perks and pensions because of a few settlements, Obama might have gotten a real settlement construction freeze that ushered in a real peace process.</s> 

<s i="2">Now it's too late.</s> <s i="3">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has already pronounced Netanyahu's relatively minor gestures &quot;unprecedented&quot; and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) has embarrassed himself several times over by bending to Obama's promises.</s> <s i="4">Factor in the on-again-off-again possibility of Palestinian elections and of Abu Mazen not running in them, as well as Hamas' cagey attitude toward a new unity framework and agreed election date, and we not only do not have an Israeli-Palestinian peace process, we don't even know when one will begin.</s> 

<s i="5">Obama is not the only or even the main player at fault.</s> <s i="6">Blame should start with Netanyahu, Abu Mazen and the moderate Arab states, all of whom have made the freshman US president's Middle East life pretty exasperating.</s> <s i="7">Nevertheless, Obama's original pledge to engage in depth appears still to be valid.</s> <s i="8">Hence the media, along with politicians on both sides, have presented him with a broad selection of options for his next move--the kind that emerge like mushrooms after a rain when the process appears to be stuck.</s> 

<s i="9">One is to &quot;pull a Jim Baker&quot;, freeze American involvement and tell Israelis and Palestinians to get in touch when they're finally serious.</s> <s i="10">As I recall, that tactic didn't last long even with Baker in his day.</s> 

<s i="11">Another is to double the pressure on both sides, but particularly on Netanyahu, until Abu Mazen can &quot;save face&quot; and sit down together with Netanyahu.</s> <s i="12">That may well have been the tenor of the Obama-Netanyahu discussion last week.</s> <s i="13">The problem here is that even when they do sit down, it appears doubtful--in view of their known positions and despite Netanyahu's well-known protestations to the contrary--that any significant peace process will get started.</s> <s i="14">Here Obama might want to listen to the many friendly Israelis who have urged him to come to Israel and address the public directly--not through Netanyahu or the American Jewish community--in order to galvanize support for the concessions he is calling for.</s>

<s i="15">Then there are the diverse Palestinian unilateral ideas that have emerged in the recent months of stalemate.</s> <s i="16">They are problematic.</s> <s i="17">But insofar as they constitute a departure from traditional Palestinian &quot;all or nothing&quot; demands, they are worthy of Obama's attention.</s> 

<s i="18">Thus, PM Salam Fayyad has launched a two-year process of unilateral state-building that in some ways dovetails with Netanyahu's &quot;economic peace&quot; and Tony Blair's efforts on behalf of the Quartet.</s> <s i="19">But there is no clearly-defined territorial framework or political deadline in sight.</s> <s i="20">Most recently, Fateh leaders have been talking of a unilateral declaration of independence in the entire West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem to be ratified by the United Nations.</s> <s i="21">But they have no control over Gaza, East Jerusalem or most of the West Bank and they declared independence already 21 years ago.</s>

<s i="22">At the global level, there are reports of a joint US-Russian initiative to convene a multilateral peace conference in Moscow and internationalize the solution.</s> <s i="23">That boomeranged at Geneva in 1977, thankfully bringing Anwar Sadat to Jerusalem, and launched a peace process at Madrid in 1991.</s>

<s i="24">In Israel, the flavor of the week is Shaul Mofaz's &quot;sixty percent&quot; plan to withdraw from additional parts of the West Bank and allow the emergence of a provisional Palestinian state there, with international guarantees regarding everything to follow.</s> <s i="25">Mofaz, a former IDF chief of staff and defense minister who is challenging Tzipi Livni's leadership of the Kadima party, appears to have consulted with a lot of Israelis but no Palestinians about his plan.</s> <s i="26">Particularly pathetic is his offer to talk to Hamas: on condition that they first accept his plan, or alternatively that they accept the Quartet's conditions--apparently it's not quite clear even to Mofaz.</s>

<s i="27">Once Obama has sifted through all these ideas, he might consider this synthesis of their implications.</s> <s i="28">On the Israeli-Palestinian front, the two sides are not ripe for a comprehensive solution to all their claims.</s> <s i="29">Hence some sort of limited or partial process is worth looking into; it could conceivably be linked to international recognition of a Palestinian state without final borders in accordance with roadmap phase II.</s>

<s i="30">But this would be a gradual process.</s> <s i="31">Meanwhile, the regional situation is pressing and Obama needs results.</s> <s i="32">Hence an Israeli-Syrian peace process beckons.</s> <s i="33">The regional payoff yielded by a successful process, in the form of a weakening of the Syrian-Iranian relationship and of Syria's support for Hamas and Hizballah, would be immediate.</s> <s i="34">It would help the US in Iraq and with Iran and would also support Palestinian-Israeli peace by weakening Hamas.</s> <s i="35">Syrian President Bashar Assad appears to be interested and to know the price demanded of him in terms of regional and ideological orientation.</s> <s i="36">Netanyahu might find it easier politically to make territorial concessions designed to weaken Iran.</s>
