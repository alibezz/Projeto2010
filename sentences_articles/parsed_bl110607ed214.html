<s i="0">In the June 16, 2003 edition of bitterlemons.org, under the title &quot;Tearing down the walls&quot;, I explained why I view the two-state solution as a desperate political option for Palestinians.</s> <s i="1">To take this discussion one step forward, let us look at the psychological aspect of this question.</s>

<s i="2">Irreplaceable time has been lost talking about a two-state solution.</s> <s i="3">In the meantime, Israel has been working on a no-state solution: settlements are bigger, the wall is longer, the occupation is ever more committed and the political discourse of ethnic cleansing has gotten louder.</s> <s i="4">Israel wants an endless occupation of either a self-destructing Palestine or a Palestine that provides &quot;the hewers of wood and the drawers of water&quot; forever.</s>

<s i="5">In social psychology it has been argued that the importance of justice cannot be ignored in conflict resolution.</s> <s i="6">Perceived fairness is an important determinant of human behavior and affective reactions.</s> <s i="7">All peace proposals seem to ignore this important aspect.</s> <s i="8">Deals are based on profoundly unjust divisions of land, water and natural wealth that establish a de facto ghettoization and promote slave labor by maintaining huge economic differences and a significant discrepancy in average income and basic labor rights while maintaining Israel's military superiority that will always threaten and jeopardize our survival.</s>

<s i="9">Yet we are expected to accept Israel's pathological equation of safety with having a Jewish majority in a Jewish state.</s> <s i="10">There is already a level of physical integration between Palestinians and Israelis, both inside and outside the green line.</s> <s i="11">And there is no guarantee that Israel will remain a Jewish state due to the rapid growth of its Arab minority.</s> <s i="12">What will happen then?</s> <s i="13">Transfer or genocide?</s> <s i="14">What about Palestinian fears?</s> <s i="15">Why can't Israelis accept that a constitution that guarantees equality before the law and equality of opportunity will protect us from each other?</s>

<s i="16">Palestinians have developed a very distinct and strong national identity that draws on the heritage, culture, narrative, glories and tragedies related to historic Palestine.</s> <s i="17">Any amputation from this land is a profound trauma to our national pride and will always hurt us as a phantom pain for a lost limb that we feel intensely but others don't recognize.</s>

<s i="18">I realize that it is impossible for both Israelis and Palestinians to discard their identities.</s> <s i="19">But I believe that a larger group identity can be constructed, like the identity brought by a unity state, which does not conflict with the other two.</s> <s i="20">Under constitutional protection that respects civic life, provides a guarantee of individual and group rights and thus organizes relationships we could engender a state of mutual respect and trust, rather than the manipulation and abuse inherent in the relationship between a dominant Israel and a weak and fractured Palestine.</s>

<s i="21">After so great a loss of people, prestige, land and dignity a nation has to mourn.</s> <s i="22">But the lack of acknowledgment and the mooted partial compensation leaves any possibility of mourning polluted by feelings of humiliation, rage, irredentism for what has been lost and a sense of entitlement to regain it that will always impair hopes of peace.</s> <s i="23">In a two-state solution we shall internalize all those negative feelings, identify with our aggressor and live with psychological degeneration.</s> <s i="24">Separation breaches legal equality and equality of opportunity and can never be fair or just; it will only exacerbate hatred, prejudice, fear and mistrust.</s>

<s i="25">A unity state will not be the undoing of the historic injustices inflicted upon the Palestinian people.</s> <s i="26">But it will allow us, after a full recognition of the wrongs and the subsequent possibility of true mourning, to forget about the past and put an end to ongoing injustices: the occupation of Palestine and the discrimination against Palestinians with Israeli citizenship.</s>

<s i="27">On September 14, 2003, the New York Times reported a poll showing that 25 to 30 percent of Palestinians support the idea of a unity state.</s> <s i="28">My own impression is that a majority of Palestinians holding Israeli citizenship view the one state proposition as the optimal one, this, without any serious supportive political or media advocacy.</s>

<s i="29">Today, this solution seems ever more popular given the facts on the ground Israel has established, leaving no possibility that a viable, sovereign Palestinian state with real resources can be created out of the remnants of the pre-1967 borders.</s> <s i="30">The Palestinian elections also exposed the US myth that two democratic states never fight each other.</s>

<s i="31">The Palestinian struggle for liberation and justice can only come to fruition in a unity state.</s> <s i="32">It is the only viable, desirable and sustainable solution that will restore to Palestinians their dignity and morality and guarantee freedom.</s>
