<s i="0">The January 9, 2005 elections for the chairman or president (rais) of the Palestinian Authority are now the dominant theme in Palestinian political life, Israeli-Palestinian relations, and the international community's involvement.</s> <s i="1">All in all this is a positive development, and the Palestinian political community is to be commended for moving so quickly and decisively in this direction in the aftermath of Yasser Arafat's death.</s> <s i="2">The early politicking is reminiscent of the 1996 elections, when Palestine's nascent democracy was the envy of the Arab world, and before things went so sour for both Palestinians and Israelis.</s>

<s i="3">A number of issues have to be clarified before the full significance, or lack thereof, of these elections can be understood and internalized by the parties.</s> 

<s i="4">First, when it comes to peace process issues, Israel is treaty-bound to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization, not the Palestinian Authority.</s> <s i="5">This is clearly stipulated in the Oslo Declaration of Principles.</s> <s i="6">The PLO has already selected its new leader, Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas).</s> <s i="7">The January 9 elections will, if Abu Mazen wins, confirm leadership through a democratic process and signify that the posts of PLO leader and PA leader are effectively synonymous.</s>

<s i="8">Secondly, insofar as the Palestinian political establishment is now determined to manage its affairs in accordance with the Palestinian constitution and the rule of law, which Arafat so readily flouted, the important figure in Palestinian Authority political life is going to be the prime minister, not the rais, whose position is largely symbolic.</s> <s i="9">Abu Ala (Ahmed Qurei) already holds this post, and seems likely to continue to hold it if Abu Mazen is elected president.</s>

<s i="10">Indeed, it behooves us to recall that throughout the past two years, Israel, the United States and to a large extent the European Union exercised heavy pressure on Arafat to behave like a figurehead president--&quot;like President Katzav in Israel&quot;--as stipulated in the Palestinian constitution, and to delegate more authority to the prime minister.</s> <s i="11">Thus when President Bush and British PM Blair place so much emphasis on Palestinian presidential elections they are sending a confusing message: with Arafat it was all personal; his successor will be viewed as the primary political leader regardless of the constitution.</s> <s i="12">This begs the question: what will they do if the Palestinians elect a new president who has extreme views?</s>

<s i="13">One conclusion that emerges from this analysis concerns the importance of new elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council.</s> <s i="14">If the new president acquiesces in his constitutional role, the council will finally wield real power.</s> <s i="15">In order for Palestinian democracy to triumph, then, we have to witness council elections too, the sooner, the better.</s>

<s i="16">A second conclusion concerns the Israeli role and the attitude of PM Sharon.</s> <s i="17">Thus far Sharon has made the right gestures concerning the facilitation of Palestinian elections, including in East Jerusalem, in accordance with the line emanating from Washington.</s> <s i="18">If we make a leap of faith and assume for a moment that those elections go smoothly and empower a moderate Palestinian leader who resolutely opposes violence, then Sharon will be in a predicament: within a short time, he will not be able to suffice with disengagement alone, and will have to address the issue of a renewed peace process.</s> <s i="19">This he is neither personally nor ideologically equipped to do.</s> <s i="20">Accordingly, we encounter the risk that he will try to thwart the entire process in order to avoid having to approach this slippery slope.</s>

<s i="21">Further, before we can make a leap of faith we must first address the reality on the ground in Palestine.</s> <s i="22">Neither Abu Mazen nor Abu Ala has strong grassroots support or readily available &quot;divisions&quot;.</s> <s i="23">It is politically convenient for them to place the onus of ending violence and incitement on Israel.</s> <s i="24">In this context, Sharon's readiness to forego the dismantling of terrorist organizations for the time being and his insistence that instead the Palestinian leadership concentrate on ending incitement against Israel and Jews, is a reasonable demand.</s> <s i="25">The current Palestinian leadership, however temporary, also has obligations to Israel.</s> <s i="26">If it proves unable to confront Palestinian terrorist groups and incapable of achieving a comprehensive ceasefire, it should not complain about punitive Israeli incursions designed to prevent acts of terrorism against Israeli civilians.</s>
