<s i="0">The visit of Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas to the White House should be considered a huge public relations success.</s> <s i="1">There were smiles, pats on the back and positive statements as regards the future, as well as a $50 million aid package long ago promised to the Palestinians but prevented until now from reaching the Palestinian Authority by the US Congress because of its absolute bias toward Israel.</s> 
  
<s i="2">Still, everything went smoothly.</s> <s i="3">It seems as though the two sides have learned their lesson from when Abu Mazen was prime minister--one that he would not want to repeat.</s> <s i="4">It seems the Palestinian president remembered well the failed Aqaba experience when he gave a speech that he hoped would portray him as bringing down the level of expectations and demands, but which, instead, many Palestinians considered a catastrophe.</s> 
  
<s i="5">This time, the Palestinian rhetoric was clear, specific and included all the demands that form the basis of any settlement from the official Palestinian viewpoint.</s> <s i="6">Abu Mazen clearly realizes his position before his people in the face of sharp criticism from Fateh circles under the leadership of Farouq Qaddumi.</s> 
  
<s i="7">US president George W. Bush has also learned a lesson, making supportive statements for Abbas.</s> <s i="8">The American administration seems to have realized that its negative attitude toward Abu Mazen during his stint as prime minister contributed to the weakening of his position and status, something they did not want to repeat.</s> <s i="9">On the contrary, they wanted to present Abu Mazen as a leader with their full support, especially in view of the difficult internal situation Fateh is facing vis-a-vis Hamas.</s> 
  
<s i="10">Bush�s statements during the joint press conference with Abbas were reassuring in that they reaffirmed the constants in Bush�s position, outlined in his vision for a political settlement.</s> 
  
<s i="11">So, everyone came out pleased with the meeting, perhaps even the Israelis, who were able to prevent any losses to their own position.</s> 
  
<s i="12">However, is this euphoria well placed?</s> <s i="13">Given that we need more than public relations, it most certainly isn�t. If things remain the same as now, the entire situation will inevitably explode and the region will be pushed back to a boiling point.</s> 
  
<s i="14">This is exactly what the US administration does not want.</s> <s i="15">It is in their interest for the calm to continue and for the situation to be contained so they can be free to deal with Iraq and its many complications.</s> <s i="16">The question then remains whether this administration has the vision and necessary tools to diffuse the explosive spark between the Palestinians and Israelis?</s> 
  
<s i="17">The American administration knows what it takes to diffuse the crisis and how to reach a political settlement to the conflict.</s>  <s i="18">In short, pressure needs to be applied on Israel if we are to reach a settlement that is in any way acceptable to the Palestinians and Arabs.</s> <s i="19">However, this administration does not want or cannot pressure Israel because it is under pressure by the American-Israeli Political Action Committee, AIPAC, and the message being sent to the American administration by the Jewish lobby is loud and clear.</s> 
  
<s i="20">As a result, this administration is circumventing what is really necessary by creating an impression that Abbas� basic problems are internal, that is, the danger he faces from Hamas.</s> <s i="21">It is because of this �internal danger� that the US should help Abbas, both financially and morally.</s> <s i="22">It is with this in mind that we should read the positive statements and gestures Bush extended to Abu Mazen during their press conference.</s>
  
<s i="23">As long as the United States refuses to comprehend that the crux of the problem lies with the Israeli government not wanting to reach a political settlement with the Palestinian people, preferring rather to impose a settlement on its own terms, the situation in the region will continue to explode time and again.</s> <s i="24">The occupation is the reason for the struggle and tension and not vice versa.</s> <s i="25">American pressure should be directed at Israel and not the Palestinians.</s> <s i="26">Even if Abbas reins in Hamas, as long as Israel continues to impose facts on Palestinian ground this creates a constant potential for explosion.</s>
  
<s i="27">Although the Palestinian people appreciate the United States and its people, it has little confidence in its policies in the region or in consecutive administrations that grow increasingly biased toward Israel.</s> <s i="28">For Bush�s statements to be treated with anything but scorn, they must be followed up by action.</s> 
  
<s i="29">It would be good if the American president remembered all the obligations his own government outlined for Israel to abide by.</s> <s i="30">It would be better still if the administration guaranteed that Israel commit to these obligations.</s> <s i="31">The Bush administration and Sharon�s government cannot continue to have their cake and eat it too.</s> 
  
<s i="32">Palestinians must feel a tangible change on the ground.</s> <s i="33">The checkpoints and the humiliation they bring are still realities.</s> <s i="34">The occupying Israeli army is still in Palestinian cities.</s> <s i="35">Settlement construction is intensifying throughout the West Bank, and the building of the separation wall in the West Bank is continuing apace, with Jerusalem completely isolated from its Palestinian surroundings.</s> 
  
<s i="36">In the meantime, the Israeli government is trying to rid itself of the Gaza Strip in order to confront the Palestinian �demographic danger�.</s> <s i="37">And for this Bush wants the Palestinians to turn a blind eye to all of the above and praise Sharon.</s>
