<s i="0">Despite their apparent weaknesses, President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert are still scavenging for achievements in the next few months before the end of their mandate in office and before US President George W. Bush leaves the White House.</s>

<s i="1">Olmert, who is battling corruption investigations, longs to go down in history as the Israeli leader who established peace in this instable and troubled region without giving concessions to the Palestinians.</s> <s i="2">True to this, since resuming negotiations with President Abbas he has yet to implement any unilateral withdrawals from the West Bank, something he had previously promised.</s> <s i="3">He has also avoided removing an increasing number of checkpoints dotting the Palestinian territories (or rather, he removed some and put in place more).</s> <s i="4">Most importantly, he never froze accelerating settlement expansion in the West Bank and Jerusalem.</s> <s i="5">Recently, he even hinted it would be difficult to achieve agreement over Jerusalem.</s>

<s i="6">As for Abbas, his mandate in power is to end next January and he is in dire need of any achievement to make his people forget that his reign has been overshadowed by a split between Palestinians in their homeland.</s> <s i="7">Also, any achievement on his part will help his Fateh party to assume power again in possible future elections.</s>

<s i="8">Bush, who is in fact the first US president to call clearly for the establishment of a Palestinian state but has so far failed to adopt a concrete policy to translate his words into facts on the ground, will exploit any progress in the Arab-Israel conflict to change the poor reputation he acquired following wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.</s> <s i="9">Any perceived progress will also help the Republican party in the upcoming presidential elections.</s>

<s i="10">Yet, despite the efforts by Abbas and Olmert to reach an agreement, a recent statement by the head of the Palestinian negotiating team, Ahmad Qurei, indicated that peace talks with Israel have reached a deadlock after months of negotiations and dozens of meetings failed to narrow the gap in the positions of the two sides, particularly on key negotiating issues.</s>

 <s i="11">If, nevertheless, both leaders are capable of discrediting speculation over the failure of talks and are actually able to achieve agreement, will they be able to market this agreement in their political arenas?</s>

<s i="12">The political crisis in Israel, the competition for power inside Kadima and the fact that Olmert's resignation will be effective next month, make it very difficult for any reasonable person to believe that Olmert will be able to reach an agreement on key issues in this long and complicated conflict.</s> <s i="13">Even if there is a miracle and Olmert reaches an agreement with Abbas, he will not have sufficient time to promote it since he will be excluded from Israeli political life before the ink is dry.</s>

<s i="14">For his part, President Abbas has made it clear on numerous occasions that in the absence of agreement over Jerusalem there will be no general agreement at all.</s> <s i="15">Still, if he actually does counter all expectations and succeeds in achieving an agreement, he may only be able to enforce it in the West Bank.</s> 

<s i="16">Furthermore, if a prisoner exchange takes place between Israel and Hamas, the released Hamas-affiliated parliamentarians can be expected to rescind all recent presidential decrees and agreements, including those signed with Israel, and undermine the Fayyad government with a no-confidence vote.</s> 

<s i="17">Moreover, that the right wing could take power in Israel in any future elections if recent opinion polls are any indication proves that the Israeli public still favors tough extremist policies toward the Palestinians and supports the continuation of settlement activities in the West Bank and Jerusalem.</s>

<s i="18">On the part of the Palestinians, in the absence of any real unity, it would be unrealistic to expect that agreement reached by only a portion of the Palestinians will be honored by the rest.</s> <s i="19">Therefore, regardless of the position and conditions set by the international community, it should be understood that Palestinian national unity is of vital interest to the security of the entire region.</s> <s i="20">Consequently, the policy of isolation and sanctions by the international community against part of the Palestinians has failed to yield the intended results.</s> 

<s i="21">In addition, both peoples suffer from the absence of charismatic leaders who are able to take historic decisions for the benefit of peace and security in the entire Middle East region.</s> <s i="22">If the notion that one people has the right to dominate and decide the fate of another people and hinder its self-determination continues, the region will never enjoy stability.</s> <s i="23">Therefore, unless there is an emancipation of minds from the concept of occupation, nothing will change.</s>
