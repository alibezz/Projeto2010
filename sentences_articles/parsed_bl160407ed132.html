<s i="0">There may still be some difficult negotiations ahead.</s> <s i="1">The internal politics on both the Palestinian and Israeli sides will be a hindrance.</s> <s i="2">Nevertheless, one should expect that, perhaps sooner rather than later, there will a deal to exchange Palestinian political prisoners for the Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit.</s>

<s i="3">On the Palestinian side the release of Palestinian political prisoners is a top priority among the general public.</s> <s i="4">Over 10,000 prisoners languish in Israeli jails, and their families and friends are an influential lobby pressuring the Palestinian government.</s> <s i="5">President Mahmoud Abbas' inability to bring about the release of prisoners after his election in January 2005 undermined the perception of his effectiveness among a majority of Palestinians.</s>

<s i="6">From an Israeli point of view, there are several precedents for prisoner exchanges, both Palestinian and Lebanese.</s> <s i="7">Families of captive soldiers have also frequently worked as effective lobbies pressuring the government.</s> <s i="8">The case of Ron Arad has haunted successive Israeli governments.</s>

<s i="9">Still, prisoner exchanges often fall prey to internal politics.</s> <s i="10">The present Israeli government is widely seen as weak, and parties in the opposition are lurking to pounce at any move, including meeting Palestinian demands for an exchange.</s>

<s i="11">The problem is, as one Israeli writer said recently albeit in a different context, when Israel is strong, it has no need to make peaceful gestures, and when it is weak it lacks the ability to do so.</s> <s i="12">As a result, Palestinians have concluded that only by capturing soldiers can they secure the release of their prisoners.</s>

<s i="13">Look at the period following the election of Abbas.</s> <s i="14">For a whole year, until parliamentary elections in January 2006, the Israeli government had an opportunity to &quot;bolster&quot;</s> <s i="15">Abbas' standing.</s> <s i="16">Israel was even urged to do so by the US administration.</s> <s i="17">A release of prisoners would have been a very effective move in this direction.</s> <s i="18">But it was only after Hamas' victory in the PLC elections that the Israeli government entertained the idea of releasing imprisoned Fateh leader Marwan Barghouti.</s> <s i="19">The problem the Israeli government faces now is how to do so without giving victory to Hamas or leaving Barghouti indebted to Hamas rather than Abbas.</s>

<s i="20">From a broader regional and international perspective, the exchange of prisoners is an important first step in a series of moves that may pave the way for a possible resumption of a political process.</s> <s i="21">There is no certainty that such a process will start, but it is certain that a political process will not start without a conducive atmosphere.</s> <s i="22">Such an atmosphere would almost certainly need to include an exchange of prisoners and a mutual ceasefire in Gaza as well as the West Bank.</s> 

<s i="23">At least, this is the Palestinian understanding of the EU statement issued shortly after the end of the Arab summit in Riyadh last month.</s> <s i="24">The EU's statement emphasized that it will be judging the performance of the new Palestinian government on the basis of its deeds.</s> <s i="25">This is a realignment of position, compared to earlier statements where only &quot;words&quot; were mentioned, that is, the Palestinian government's acceptance of the three conditions of the Quartet.</s> <s i="26">There is therefore a clear interest on the part of the Palestinian Authority headed by Abbas to expedite the exchange in order to lay the ground for a possible political process.</s>

<s i="27">I say &quot;possible&quot; because the Israeli government has so far refused to discuss &quot;final status&quot; issues, such as Jerusalem, borders and refugees, and has not accepted the Arab Peace Initiative, extended again at the summit in Riyadh.</s> <s i="28">The Oslo process failed because these issues were not finalized at the beginning and instead became a victim of the balance of forces between the two sides.</s>
