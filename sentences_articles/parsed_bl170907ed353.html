<s i="0">In truth, Israel's response to rocket fire from Gaza will have little influence on its relations with the Palestinians.</s> <s i="1">President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), currently Israel's only interlocutor, can neither make concessions in anyone else's name nor coerce anyone.</s> <s i="2">Indeed, the day the IDF loosens its grip on the West Bank, we will witness the countdown toward a takeover there by Hamas.</s> 

<s i="3">These are the basic and important facts of life that will determine the nature of Israel's relationship with the Palestinians.</s> <s i="4">Israel's reaction to the rocket fire from Gaza will have but a short-lived and insignificant effect on that relationship.</s>

<s i="5">Israel currently has four potential ways of responding to the continued Qassam fire.</s> 

<s i="6">First, it can submit.</s> <s i="7">It can agree to a ceasefire attained through direct or indirect negotiations with Hamas.</s> <s i="8">Those negotiations would provide Hamas with the attributes of legitimacy as an interlocutor, while the ceasefire would give it time to complete its takeover of Gaza and build up its military capacity until it feels strong enough.</s> <s i="9">The temporary quiet generated by the ceasefire, however illusory, would provide a convenient backdrop for ongoing negotiations with Abu Mazen.</s> <s i="10">This would be convenient for both Abu Mazen and the government of Israel, to the extent that through negotiations held against such a backdrop Abu Mazen could register genuine achievements.</s> <s i="11">The Israeli government would rationalize its concessions based on its desire to maintain peace and quiet and bolster Abu Mazen's leadership.</s> 

<s i="12">A second possibility is maintaining the status quo with occasional deeper and even audacious penetrations into the Gaza Strip, while ensuring that IDF troops do not remain for long inside the Strip in order to control the territory.</s> <s i="13">Under these circumstances, quiet would not be maintained for long and Qassams would continue to fall on Israeli towns around Gaza.</s> <s i="14">But this situation would be described as a reasonable price to pay for strengthening Abu Mazen and the moderate line he represents.</s>

<s i="15">Third, Israel could exact a price for every Qassam by exploiting its capacity to stop the flow of electricity, fuel, flour and even water to the Strip.</s> <s i="16">The assumption here is that, if deprived of the most basic commodities, Palestinians would revolt and apply pressure to Hamas.</s> <s i="17">This approach would not seek to influence Abu Mazen politically, although he would be hard pressed to proceed with negotiations with an Israeli partner portrayed as cruel and exploiting unfortunate civilians as hostages.</s> 

<s i="18">In my modest opinion, this approach would stand little chance of success, for two reasons.</s> <s i="19">For one, Hamas is more brutal than it might seem; there is no reason to believe that it would now be more considerate of its civilians.</s> <s i="20">Then too, the approach would fail because of international opinion, which would refuse to legitimize such Israeli action even though nearly all nations have at one time or another used it.</s> <s i="21">Moreover, I believe that for moral reasons Israel as a Jewish state should avoid following this path.</s> <s i="22">But this moves us into a discussion of the dos and don'ts of fighting terrorists who exploit a friendly civilian population--a discussion that can be pursued at another time and place.</s> 

<s i="23">Fourth and last, Israel has the option of responding to the Qassams by entering the territory from which they were fired, cleansing it of terrorist elements and remaining there for years, along the pattern of the West Bank since the spring of 2002.</s> <s i="24">If the range of the rockets were to increase, so too would the extent of IDF occupation, with the objective of preventing terrorist activity.</s>

<s i="25">This approach has several major constraints.</s> <s i="26">It would involve the death of Israeli soldiers and not a few Palestinians.</s> <s i="27">The process of eliminating terrorist capabilities in occupied territory is not a short one (about half a year, based on the West Bank experience), and it produces a heavy increase in hostile contact with Palestinians.</s> <s i="28">Abu Mazen would clearly be hard put to maintain the pretense of a political track and would be forced to postpone it.</s> <s i="29">Both he and the government of Israel would be placed in a difficult situation.</s> 

<s i="30">These are the relevant circumstances under which, for an extended time now, the Israeli government has delayed making a decision to reoccupy the north-eastern sector of the Strip in order to prevent attacks on Sderot--even though there is no other way, save surrender, to prevent the Qassam fire.</s> <s i="31">Clearly, as long as the government of Israel prefers to negotiate with Abu Mazen it will seek to postpone a military move deemed necessary for the protection of its citizens.</s>
