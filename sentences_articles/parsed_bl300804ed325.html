<s i="0">United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 once seemed to promise Palestine a future.</s> <s i="1">By emphasizing &quot;the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war,&quot; it rejected Israeli claims to the West Bank including east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="2">And by reaffirming the need for a &quot;just and lasting peace&quot;--including &quot;a just settlement to the refugee problem&quot;--Palestine and her children seemed finally slated to receive a viaticum of justice.</s> <s i="3">But now, nearly 37 years later, Palestine conjures up an ever-impossible dream and UNSCR 242 might actually renege on its pledge of partial self-determination and justice.</s>
  
<s i="4">Originally, UNSCR 242 represented as much victory as it did defeat.</s> <s i="5">Five months before its passage, Israel had ravished the remains of Palestine in the Six-Day War, and ever since, the Palestinians there who had not been killed or displaced by Israel were forced to live under military occupation.</s> <s i="6">Already, Israel had outraged the international community by de facto annexing East Jerusalem, and already, extremist Zionists sought to realize their dreams of replacing the indigenous Christian and Muslim communities of &quot;Judea and Samaria&quot;</s> <s i="7">(the West Bank) and Gaza with Jewish immigrants.</s> 
  
<s i="8">UNSCR 242, however, reminded Israel and the world that the Palestinians are people--they have rights and their historical and cultural connections to their land should not be negated by any other.</s> <s i="9">It inspired hope among Palestinians as well as in the Arab world.</s> <s i="10">Finally, it seemed, the international community--which bore no small measure of culpability for the conflict--had decided to assume some responsibility for its vagaries and would ensure Israel's compliance with the law.</s> 
  
<s i="11">By the 1980s, UNSCR 242 became the clarion call for some Palestinian and Israeli activists.</s> <s i="12">Not only did it sanctify the ideal of Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security, it also charted a path: Israel would withdraw from territories it seized in the 1967 War, millions of Palestinian refugees would finally gain control over their lives and be compensated for their losses, and the details of cooperation and coexistence could presumably be negotiated, with international support.</s> 
  
<s i="13">But for all the high-minded ideals and promise that UNSCR 242 held, many Palestinians struggled in its celebration.</s> <s i="14">Israel's independence less than 20 years earlier had seen the loss of 78% of historic Palestine and the expulsion of two-thirds of its indigenous Christian and Muslim population.</s> <s i="15">Accepting UNSCR 242 seemed to mean accepting that Palestine, as a place where all her historic communities could live together, could only exist in the remaining 22%.</s> <s i="16">Further, UNSCR 242 could have been read to prejudice many other basic claims as well.</s> <s i="17">For example, although it rearticulated the foundational principle of the post-World War II order that territory may never be acquired by force, it only spoke of &quot;territories occupied in the recent conflict,&quot; and not territories acquired by force in Israel's War of Independence, such as the 23% of historic Palestine that Israel had seized in excess of the General Assembly's partition recommendation.</s>
 
<s i="18">Nevertheless, the Palestinian leadership did make the historic compromise of accepting UNSCR 242--which, once Israel putatively accepted it, served as the basis for the now-eviscerated Oslo peace process.</s> <s i="19">UNSCR 242 seemed to guarantee Palestinian refugees the same package of rights that was accorded all other refugees under international law.</s> <s i="20">Forcing the refugees to subsist in squalor for decades was not their choice to make, the leadership reasoned, and a peace--even if not the ideal peace of a secular state of Palestine in all of historic Palestine with equal rights and opportunities for all--would be good for all involved.</s> <s i="21">The Palestinian leadership had determined that a Palestine in part of Palestine was better than no Palestine at all.</s> 
  
<s i="22">That concession, however, bore very little in the way of fruit.</s> <s i="23">While it did eventually pave the way for limited autonomy in some Palestinian population centers, the occupation persists and the refugees' redemption is but a rallying cry of a nation almost defeated.</s> <s i="24">In fact, Israel has stepped up its conquest of Palestinian territory, erecting a wall to both shield its illegal colonies and stake out more territory.</s> <s i="25">Palestinians are literally being encaged and entire villages and communities are fading into the unforgiving shadows of history.</s> <s i="26">Far from ushering in a new era of two states living side by side in peace and security, UNSCR 242 has only seen one state ravenously devour any prospects for the future of another.</s>  
  
<s i="27">In fact, UNSCR 242 might actually serve as one of the chief rhetorical weapons in the destruction of the two-state solution, if it hasn't already.</s> <s i="28">At its heart, UNSCR 242 is about boundaries and lines.</s> <s i="29">The boundaries and lines that UNSCR 242 suggests sketch the territorial basis of the two-state solution.</s> <s i="30">It says that Israel may not forcibly acquire territory beyond the Green Line; and that security and recognition should be accorded all states in the region, not just Israel.</s> 
  
<s i="31">Israeli politicians, however, routinely bastardize the language of UNSCR 242 to justify realities and practices entirely outside of its purview.</s> <s i="32">Although the language and drafting history of UNSCR 242 clearly demonstrates that its intent was not to sanction Israeli conquest of Palestine's remains, &quot;pro-Israeli&quot; politicians and polemicists bully its words to support Israeli settlement activity.</s> <s i="33">Obviously, this activity threatens to destroy any possibility of a Palestinian state, much less the minimum guaranteed by UNSCR 242.</s> <s i="34">Already, Israel's colonies have fragmented the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.</s> <s i="35">The Israeli human rights organization B'tselem reports that Israel's colonies have incorporated nearly 42% of the West Bank into their jurisdictional boundaries.</s> <s i="36">And the remaining 58% of the 21% of historic Palestine more closely resembles the scattered shards of a broken vase than any state-in-the-making.</s> <s i="37">By perverting the language and intent of UNSCR 242 to accept this activity, these &quot;Israeli advocates&quot; blur the lines that formed the basis of the resolution, rattling the very foundation of the two-state solution.</s>
  
<s i="38">And there's one added irony: Just as UNSCR 242 represented the international community assuming responsibility for a problem that it created, it may also become emblematic of the international community's ambivalence.</s> <s i="39">The Palestinians claim the weight of international law--not just UNSCR 242, but also General Assembly resolution 194, and the recent ruling of the International Court of Justice, as well as international customs and treaties.</s> <s i="40">Israel, however, has thumbed its nose at international law and the international community by consistently and fragrantly violating this body of principles.</s> <s i="41">And the international community has acquiesced, all the while paying lip service to UNSCR 242's increasingly improbable promise.</s>
