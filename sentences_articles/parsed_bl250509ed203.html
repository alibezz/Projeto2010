<s i="0">While it is still early to assess the effect of US President Barack Obama's policy innovations in the Middle East, it is already clear that his preliminary steps reflect a substantive change in the triangular relationship involving the US, Israel and the Palestinians.</s> <s i="1">Obama's decision to phone Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas prior to contacting then PM Ehud Olmert in Jerusalem constituted the first signal to Israel that the new president had a different take on the Israeli-American &quot;special relationship&quot;.</s> <s i="2">Similarly, the choice of al-Arabiya satellite TV station as the first venue for presenting his policies toward the Arab and Muslim worlds was a clear sign that Obama wants to change their image of the White House as a &quot;Jewish house&quot;</s> <s i="3">(which also happens to be the name of a right-wing religious party in the Netanyahu coalition).</s>

<s i="4">To further remove any doubt in the hearts of Muslims and demonstrate that the new president is not a prisoner of the pro-Israel lobby, Obama invited King Abdullah of Jordan to be the first Middle East leader to visit his White House.</s> <s i="5">On June 4, the American president will visit Cairo without stopping in Jerusalem.</s> <s i="6">Behind these gestures stands an administration that misses no opportunity to clarify that it is US interests and not pressures from Israel and its lobbyists that will determine its Middle East policy.</s> <s i="7">Whether regarding solutions for the Israel-Arab conflict or for the nuclear crisis with Iran, Obama makes no attempt to paper over his disagreement with Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu.</s> 

<s i="8">Since the October 1991 Madrid conference, America's &quot;special relationship&quot; with Israel has undermined Arab confidence in US neutrality.</s> <s i="9">The traditional public commitment of American administrations to maintain Israel's qualitative edge has rendered the Stars and Stripes a constant companion of the Israeli flag in the bonfires lit by the rivals of moderate Arab regimes.</s>

<s i="10">Obama's concentrated effort to win the Muslim world's confidence in his ability to function as an honest broker between it and Israel is in its early stages.</s> <s i="11">Obtaining that trust is a necessary first step in advancing the peace plan that is taking shape in the White House (apparently in the spirit of the Clinton parameters of December 2000 and the Arab Peace Initiative of March 2002).</s> <s i="12">The implementation of any such plan will require significant concessions not only from Israel; the Palestinians will have to abandon the right of return of the 1948 refugees and the demand for full sovereignty in the Old City of Jerusalem.</s> <s i="13">They'll have to agree to demilitarization of their state and the deployment of international forces there for a trial period.</s> <s i="14">The Arab countries will have to make good on their peace initiative and replace the demonization of Israel with true &quot;normal relations&quot;, including the opening of their borders to Israelis.</s> 

<s i="15">Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories is only one component--and not even the most important one--in the package of incentives for the Arabs to follow through on this revolution.</s> <s i="16">The Arab regimes' primary interest and their true compensation for formally welcoming Israel to the regional family of nations is &quot;normal relations&quot; with the West, and particularly the US.</s>

<s i="17">As he builds a new relationship with the Muslim world, Obama must take care to avoid creating the mistaken impression that the US is prepared to abandon its cooperation and strategic coordination with Israel.</s> <s i="18">This special relationship between the world's strongest power and the state of Israel constituted a central motivation for states like Egypt and Jordan to come to terms with Israel's existence and enter into peace agreements.</s> <s i="19">Once Obama has persuaded the Arabs that the special relationship is not synonymous with automatic American support for Israel and acquiescence in its violation of commitments, it will also have to clarify that its overt disagreements with Israel and the smiles it offers the Arabs do not constitute an aperitif that ushers in a free meal in which Israel's interests are the main course.</s>
