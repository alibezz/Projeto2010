<s i="0">For decades, Palestinians have avoided trying to resolve their problem alone, all too aware of their weakness vis-a-vis Israel.</s> <s i="1">Nevertheless, weak or not, Palestinians have often acted unilaterally whenever they felt the other side failed to take their nationalism seriously.</s>

<s i="2">Ever since the Zionist ambition for a Jewish homeland in Arab Palestine came true, the indigenous population has believed that the world would some day and somehow come through for it.</s> <s i="3">No similar national liberation movement has attended so many international fora and joined so many diplomatic peace efforts in its attempts to reach a mutually agreed-upon resolution to the conflict.</s> <s i="4">Yet in spite of this record, little progress has been made as a result of such efforts.</s> <s i="5">On the contrary, almost every Palestinian success can instead be traced to a unilateral effort.</s>

<s i="6">In 1936, Palestinian nationalists, unhappy with the failure of the British colonialists to stem the tide of Jewish immigration, decided unilaterally to call for a general strike that lasted six months.</s> <s i="7">That strike created a direct conflict between the British mandatory authorities and the Jewish underground.</s>

<s i="8">WWII and the Nazi atrocities toward Jews eventually overturned that gain and ultimately forced the British to leave Palestine to be fought over by Jews and Arabs.</s>

<s i="9">The 1948 Nakba (catastrophe) caused the collapse of Palestinian nationalism and turned Palestinians into a refugee community, dependent on the United Nations for their humanitarian needs.</s> <s i="10">The rise of pan-Arabism in the 1950s and 60s generated the hope that others would solve their problem.</s>

<s i="11">The loss of the rest of historic Palestine in 1967, however, revitalized Palestinian nationalism and caused Palestinians to once again take their fate into their own hands.</s> <s i="12">This gave rise to the Palestine Liberation Organization and guerilla warfare.</s>

<s i="13">Perhaps the most successful example of Palestinian unilateralism was the first intifada.</s> <s i="14">This resulted in a bilateral process that eventually gave birth to the Oslo accords.</s> <s i="15">These in turn legitimized the PLO and allowed its leaders to return to Palestinian land.</s> <s i="16">But they did not end the occupation.</s> <s i="17">Indeed, as Israeli settlement building continued apace in spite of the peace process, Palestinian unilateralism in 2000 took a violent turn.</s>

<s i="18">The eruption of the second intifada sent the peace process reeling.</s> <s i="19">It ultimately produced a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the removal of the 8000-strong Jewish settler community there who controlled a third of the land.</s> <s i="20">However, that withdrawal was little more than a shift from direct occupation to indirect occupation, as manifested in Israel's tight siege on the Gaza Strip.</s>

<s i="21">The failure of US President George W. Bush to live up to his promise of Palestinian statehood under the Annapolis process caused Palestinians yet again to turn away from international promises of support.</s> 

<s i="22">Political unilateralism is now being seriously studied as an option for Palestinians to achieve genuine, independent statehood, the ultimate prize.</s> <s i="23">When the Zionists unilaterally declared statehood in 1948, the world community recognized the nascent state.</s> <s i="24">The PLO's unilateral declaration of statehood in 1988 in Algiers failed to achieve a similar result.</s> <s i="25">And since 2002, the suggestion of making another such declaration has been opposed by the US.</s>

<s i="26">But Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian prime minister, has found a loophole.</s> <s i="27">By offering a plan for a de facto Palestinian state, irrespective of the success or failure of any possible peace process, Fayyad has laid the groundwork.</s> <s i="28">Some see his plan as little more than naive optimism and predict it will go the way of so many others.</s> <s i="29">Others see in it a practical blueprint that will lay the administrative foundation for statehood.</s>
