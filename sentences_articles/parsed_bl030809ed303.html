<s i="0">The forces in the world trying to resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians--and the Arabs in general--take as their point of departure a bipolar axiom.</s> <s i="1">The Palestinians are fighting Israel in order to achieve independence and sovereignty.</s> <s i="2">Only when they achieve this objective will they be prepared to live in peace alongside Israel, and will President George W. Bush's vision of two states for two peoples be realized.</s> <s i="3">And the Israelis, if they could only gain Arab recognition of their state and a total end to violence, would agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state.</s> <s i="4">Toward that end, they will be prepared to forego territory.</s> <s i="5">With the right pressure, they'll even withdraw to the 1967 lines.</s> <s i="6">Again: two states for two peoples.</s>

<s i="7">This was the axiom that guided Bush and his Quartet colleagues when they inflicted the roadmap on the Israelis and Palestinians on April 30, 2003.</s> <s i="8">Most residents of Israel, worn down by three years of brutal suicide warfare that caused hundreds of deaths, were indeed prepared to make far-reaching concessions including the establishment of a Palestinian state.</s>

<s i="9">For Palestinians, too, the timing was not bad: the terror war had boosted their self-respect and generated global awareness of their demands.</s> <s i="10">Rather than the Palestinians seeming repugnant as a consequence of the brutal acts of terrorism they perpetrated, including the deliberate murder of women, children and the elderly, it was Israel that was perceived as responsible for the absence of regional peace and the underlying causes of terror.</s>

<s i="11">The roadmap determined that in the course of May 2003 phase I would be implemented: an end to violence.</s> <s i="12">&quot;Palestinians&quot;, states the opening paragraph, &quot;immediately undertake an unconditional cessation of violence&quot;.</s> <s i="13">And &quot;all official Palestinian institutions end incitement against Israel.&quot;</s> <s i="14">The response, especially in phases II and III (until end 2005), will be an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines and the establishment of a Palestinian state.</s>

<s i="15">Yet in the very month of May 2003 when violence was supposed to cease &quot;unconditionally&quot;, terrorism--which had been reduced in intensity by Operation Defensive Shield (following the massacre in Netanya in April 2002 of defenseless elderly Jews at a Pesach Seder)--not only failed to decline but returned in force.</s> <s i="16">May 18 witnessed a suicide attack at French Hill in Jerusalem in which seven Israelis were killed and 21 wounded.</s> <s i="17">It was followed on June 11 by the murder of 17 Israelis in a suicide bus-bombing in Jerusalem and a few days later the murder of another 23 and wounding of 116 in a Jerusalem bus attack.</s>

<s i="18">Had they really wanted a state, in 2003 the Palestinians were very close.</s> <s i="19">After all, the roadmap was accepted (albeit with reservations, mainly for domestic consumption) by none other than the government of Israel headed by Ariel Sharon--the Palestinians' greatest enemy and a man most Israelis trusted to lead them, whether through concessions or war, to security and peace.</s> <s i="20">Had the Palestinians then ceased the violence, Sharon--and only Sharon--could have persuaded his fellow countrymen and women to opt for the course of far-reaching concessions, including agreement to a Palestinian state and dismantling of settlements.</s> <s i="21">Yet instead of implementing the demands of the first clause of the roadmap, the Palestinians opted to burn the roadmap--meaning Bush's vision of two states for two peoples--in the fires of terrorism.</s>

<s i="22">Every time the Palestinians got a whiff of peace with the Jews, they drowned it in rivers of blood.</s> <s i="23">So it was in 1947, when they attacked Jewish communities and roads barely hours after the United Nations partition decision to establish two states for two peoples in the territory of the British mandate.</s> <s i="24">And so it was after the Oslo accords: they gained unimaginable achievements when an Israeli government blinded by the &quot;New Middle East&quot; allowed Yasser Arafat to return to Jericho and Gaza leading 40,000 Trojan horses who were ostensibly designated to prevent all varieties of violence.</s> 

<s i="25">They did not let him down.</s> <s i="26">Instead of stones and Molotov cocktails, the ultimate weapons of the first intifada, buses began exploding in Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan, Afula and Jerusalem, while travelers were ambushed on the roads of Judea and Samaria.</s> <s i="27">Arafat, rather than moving the Oslo agreements toward their inevitable outcome of an independent Palestinian state, sabotaged its establishment by sending suicide bombers to explode, kill and be killed.</s> <s i="28">Thus, a year before his own death, Arafat destroyed the roadmap.</s>

<s i="29">The Israeli withdrawal from the Qatif bloc in Gaza and the destruction of 25 flourishing settlements was supposed to bring the Palestinians to make parallel gestures to the Israelis that would speed up the process of establishing a state.</s> <s i="30">But those gestures, we recall, included firing hundreds of Qassam rockets at the communities of the western Negev.</s> <s i="31">Why?</s> <s i="32">We cannot escape the conclusion that these missiles too were launched in keeping with the objective of thwarting the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.</s>
