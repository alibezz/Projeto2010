<s i="0">Any comparative overview of intelligence capabilities between Palestinians and Israelis can only begin by noting a tremendous disparity.</s> <s i="1">Arriving in Palestine in a hostile environment, the Jewish settlers established rudimentary intelligence apparatuses as early as 1914.</s> <s i="2">When the Jewish Agency was founded in the 1920s, it included an Arab Affairs Department that collected information about the Palestinian population and leadership.</s> 

<s i="3">Efficient intelligence was decisive in the 1948 War and with the creation of the official Israeli army on May 26, 1948, the intelligence branches took another form.</s> <s i="4">Today, Israel's three main intelligence agencies remain Aman, military intelligence; the Shabak (General Security Service) which handles counterespionage and internal security, including intelligence gathering in the occupied territories; and the Mossad, created in 1951, which collects external intelligence, and is entrusted with carrying out clandestine Jewish immigration (from Arab countries, for example) and assassinations outside of Israel and the occupied territories.</s> <s i="5">Today Israel is making use of and developing some of the most advanced intelligence gathering technology available, including its Ofek satellite, communications sensors and unmanned hovercraft.</s> 

<s i="6">On the other side, up until 1948, Palestinians did not have a single formal intelligence body.</s> <s i="7">Even the most advanced Palestinian paramilitary organization, Al Jihad al Muqadas, led by Abdel Qader Husseini, had no intelligence branch.</s> <s i="8">After 1967, the major Palestinian faction Fateh organized Razd al Thawri, which means &quot;revolutionary intelligence&quot;, led by Saleh Khalaf (Abu Eyad).</s> <s i="9">But when Abu Eyad was captured by the Jordanian forces in 1970 and &quot;broken&quot;, he ordered by radio that Palestinian fighters surrender--and was quickly replaced by Ali Hassan Salameh, who was later assassinated by the Mossad in Beirut.</s> 

<s i="10">This negligence of intelligence capabilities is rather symptomatic of the Palestinian performance altogether.</s> <s i="11">Historically, the Palestinian struggle has been mainly spontaneous, sacrificial and demanding great resilience from the population, at the same time that political and military institutions show lack of planning.</s> <s i="12">The Arab states did not help this situation, refusing to offer logistic support.</s> <s i="13">But this is not the only way to understand this huge failure.</s> <s i="14">It is my point of view that the Palestinian leadership, including Fateh, was never really serious about armed struggle.</s> 

<s i="15">Later in the 70s, the primitive intelligence Palestinian centers, mainly found in Fateh, were divided up among the &quot;Abus&quot;, or the major Palestinian leaders.</s> <s i="16">Some of the leaders at that time had real influence, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat used this method to divide and rule (while security branches are historically competitive the world over, among Palestinians this competition was used to absorb dissent).</s> <s i="17">After the Oslo accords with Israel, there were at least ten security apparatuses in the Palestinian Authority, and according to the agreements, they were not to collect information about the Israeli side.</s>

<s i="18">Israeli intelligence infiltration into Palestinian life after 1967 was particularly dramatic because the entire occupation system was set up to force any Palestinian trying to carry out a mundane task to come in contact with Israeli intelligence agents.</s> <s i="19">If one only remembers that in four years of Nazi occupation in Belgium during World War II, the Nazis succeeded in &quot;turning&quot;</s> <s i="20">11 percent of the population, using these converts to provide intelligence, imagine the state of Palestinians after nearly 40 years of occupation, in which Palestinians have largely been cut off from the support of the outside world.</s> <s i="21">All indications are that Israeli intelligence infiltrated the high ranks of security apparatuses and Palestinian political organizations.</s> <s i="22">Palestinians have tried to deal with this through the extrajudicial killing and torture of alleged collaborators.</s> <s i="23">But these have often been the small fish or those already &quot;burned&quot;--those obviously working with the Israelis in supplying permits, selling land or accompanying Israeli special forces.</s> 

<s i="24">There have been a handful of celebrated cases in which Palestinian collaborators killed their own handlers.</s> <s i="25">But if one considers the vast number of Palestinian recruits, albeit many recruited against their will, this number is relatively small.</s> <s i="26">Many of these killings did not result from a coordinated intelligence strategy, but from personal initiative and the desire to inflict vengeance for humiliation incurred.</s> <s i="27">There have also been a handful of cases where Israelis have reported being approached by the PLO to gather information.</s> <s i="28">But these Israelis were usually caught and arrested before they could do any damage, which is just one more testimony to the effectiveness of Israel's intelligence capabilities.</s> 

<s i="29">Finally, one arena that Israeli intelligence seems to have mastered (and this is terribly pronounced in the media in the United States) is its sophisticated manner of controlling the press.</s> <s i="30">One of the main departments of the Mossad deals with psychological warfare, propaganda and operations of deception.</s> <s i="31">But the great paradox here is that there is also a great deal of &quot;real&quot; information about Israel in the press.</s> <s i="32">While Israel may not be a democracy for its Arab citizens, there is a large body of security information to be found in the public domain.</s> <s i="33">And in truth, this is one more sign of the failure of Arab intelligence efforts.</s> <s i="34">Israelis are not afraid of releasing this information because no one on the other side is paying attention.</s>
