<s i="0">In recent weeks, the Israeli media has reported that both US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Israeli PM Ehud Olmert want Israel and Palestine to reach and publish a framework agreement on final status borders, even in the absence of consensus regarding other final status core issues such as refugees/right of return and Jerusalem.</s> <s i="1">Sources close to Olmert have apparently briefed the press regarding this direction of negotiations.</s>

<s i="2">Assuming Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas were to agree on such a partial step, it would presumably constitute a so-called &quot;shelf agreement&quot; whose implementation would be postponed until roadmap phase I is carried out.</s> <s i="3">It might enable Olmert to pass a settler compensation bill and begin dismantling settlements and outposts (and build in those settlement blocs that become part of Israel) based on an agreed map.</s> <s i="4">It would give Palestinians a clear territorial goal as an incentive to forge ahead with security arrangements.</s> <s i="5">And, as an achievement for the Bush administration, it would correspond with enhanced American aid for settlement removal.</s>

<s i="6">If this is indeed the direction, it is important to recognize that the parties are still too far apart in their negotiations even on the territorial issues to agree and go public.</s> <s i="7">One report puts the negotiating gap between at least eight percent of the West Bank demanded by Israel and only 3.5 percent agreed by the Palestinians.</s> <s i="8">This is more or less where the parties were at Camp David, leaving us to wonder what progress has actually been made.</s> <s i="9">On the other hand, even that territorial gap is considerably smaller than the conceptual gaps separating the parties with regard to the Jerusalem holy basin and refugee issues.</s> 

<s i="10">Hence there is a certain logic justifying &quot;territories, settlements and borders first&quot;; it is an idea worthy of serious thought.</s> <s i="11">There would appear to be both advantages and disadvantages to the idea of disclosing the details of a territorial agreement before success has been achieved concerning other final status issues.</s> <s i="12">Not in all cases, though, does an advantage for Israel necessarily correspond with one for the Palestinians.</s> <s i="13">In other words, this is not necessarily a win-win proposition.</s>

<s i="14">On the positive side (for both parties), a border delineation agreement would signal genuine progress in peace talks and could constitute an incentive to proceed and tackle the tougher issues.</s> <s i="15">It could even form the basis of a Palestinian declaration of statehood that would correspond in part to Roadmap phase I. It could conceivably be a sufficient achievement for Olmert to take to new elections (if he survives that long politically in view of corruption allegations).</s> <s i="16">It would be good for Israel's international image and strike a dramatic blow in favor of the two-state solution.</s> <s i="17">But even if a two-state solution failed, it would give Israel an agreed border to which eventually to withdraw unilaterally.</s>

<s i="18">But at the substantive level, a West Bank-Israel border agreement would also signal that Israel and Palestine had exhausted the areas where they are capable of agreeing.</s> <s i="19">Israelis could easily live with this, but not Palestinians.</s> <s i="20">This is precisely why it is hard to believe that Abbas would make or acknowledge such a separate deal.</s> <s i="21">Moreover if he did, he would undoubtedly be hard put to persuade the Palestinian public to accept a territorial agreement--even one based on the 1967 lines--that does not offer Palestinians at least minimal satisfaction regarding the &quot;narrative&quot; and religious issues of right of return and Jerusalem and does not restore Gaza and the West Bank to united Palestinian rule.</s> 

<s i="22">Then, too, the notion of a delayed &quot;shelf agreement&quot; is untested.</s> <s i="23">How could Abbas defend his concessions when even implementation is postponed to an indefinite date?</s> <s i="24">Suppose Israel's assessment of security dangers causes it repeatedly to postpone withdrawal to the agreed new lines, thereby posing the specter of yet another unfulfilled agreement.</s>

<s i="25">Conceivably, then, Abbas would or could refuse to dignify the agreed final status map with the status of an agreement.</s> <s i="26">In other words, if indeed a territorial consensus is reached, what Olmert presents as a framework agreement would be downplayed by Abbas as merely a positive step in that direction.</s> <s i="27">Abbas would hope to use it to show his public that Israel is finally dismantling outposts and settlements.</s>
