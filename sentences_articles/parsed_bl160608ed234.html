<s i="0">Regardless of whether Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) got a green light from the United States and Israel to re-initiate dialogue with Hamas, an already large consensus is growing among Palestinians, Arabs and many international decision-makers that it is his right to do so, given that Israel is indirectly speaking to Hamas through Cairo.</s> <s i="1">Fateh's Revolutionary Council ended its meeting in May calling for the formation of a national unity government, something that will require either dissolving or expanding Salam Fayyad's government.</s> <s i="2">The Council also asked Abu Mazen to pursue dialogue on the basis of the Yemeni initiative in order to end the coup in Gaza.</s>

<s i="3">A dialogue with Hamas will not necessarily go against Israeli interests, if these interests are defined as bringing security to Israeli citizens.</s> <s i="4">It might be assumed that an Abu Mazen dialogue with Hamas will provide momentum to the ceasefire (tahdiyeh) process, given that a tahdiyeh is one of the conditions Abu Mazen wants Hamas to comply with in order to ensure Israeli reciprocity.</s> <s i="5">A ceasefire will also help Abu Mazen move ahead in negotiations on permanent status by implementing Palestinian obligations under the first phase of the roadmap.</s>

<s i="6">The dialogue with Hamas is based on the Yemeni initiative, which states that Hamas should end the coup in Gaza, commit to PLO obligations, accept Arab and international legitimacy and agree to early elections for the Palestinian Authority.</s> <s i="7">Hamas wants the articles of this initiative to be subject to negotiation and modification, while Abu Mazen wants the dialogue to be about the mechanisms for implementation and not content.</s> <s i="8">That position may help explain the lack of objection from the White House and the silence from Israel.</s> 

<s i="9">Would the American position allow Abu Mazen to negotiate with Hamas on how to implement these obligations?</s> <s i="10">The answer is yes.</s> <s i="11">The US is not against Abu Mazen's dialogue.</s> <s i="12">The US is engaged in a dialogue with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, where Washington is defending the Islamist movement's right to participate freely in Egyptian elections as part of an American policy to open dialogue with Islamist movements in order to isolate al-Qaeda as a group that uses Islam to justify terrorism.</s>

<s i="13">It is still not clear when the dialogue between Abu Mazen and Hamas will begin in earnest.</s> <s i="14">Hamas is talking about the need for proper preparation and to agree in advance on the principles of the dialogue before delving into details.</s> <s i="15">Abu Mazen and Fateh consider the Yemeni initiative as constituting those principles.</s> <s i="16">Hence there is a big gap between the two sides.</s> <s i="17">There is one area of solid agreement though: both sides want Egypt to mediate and Hosni Mubarak to personally sponsor the dialogue in cooperation with the Arab League, following the model of the Lebanese dialogue when an Arab country (Qatar) sponsored that dialogue in cooperation with the Arab League.</s>

<s i="18">The other issues of the dialogue pose problems, however.</s> <s i="19">The two sides agree that a new government should be composed of independent personalities decided upon by both sides, but they disagree on the issue of whether this government will be committed to the Arab and international resolutions regarding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</s> <s i="20">In this regard the two sides might go back to article number 6 of the National Reconciliation Document of 2007 that spoke about the establishment of a government able to get international and Arabic support.</s> 

<s i="21">When it comes to elections, Hamas is against the idea of early elections.</s> <s i="22">The movement considers itself legitimately elected for a period of four years.</s> <s i="23">Nevertheless, Hamas accepts to have elections on an agreed upon date and under an agreed upon elections law.</s> <s i="24">On the latter point, Abu Mazen wants a fully proportional system, while Hamas still supports the current law under which 50 percent of seats are decided proportionally and 50 percent are based on district results.</s>

<s i="25">Another thorny issue is that of returning to the situation before June 2007.</s> <s i="26">Hamas wants this to include the situation in the West Bank, i.e., a release from prisons of Hamas members, the re-opening of charitable organizations affiliated with the movement, the dissolution of the Salam Fayyad government and canceling of all that government's decisions regarding Hamas as well as all presidential decrees issued after June 2007.</s> <s i="27">Abu Mazen and Fateh want only a return of the status quo ante in Gaza and consider all that happened in the West Bank legitimate and not subject to change.</s>

<s i="28">The issue of reorganizing the security services in Gaza might be close to a breakthrough, however.</s> <s i="29">Both sides seem to have agreed that security forces headquarters can be temporarily put under Arab control and Arab forces be put in charge of restructuring and retraining Palestinian forces.</s> <s i="30">This was a solution hinted at by Abu Mazen in a speech on June 6, and was supported by a number of Hamas leaders in subsequent statements.</s> 

<s i="31">Finally, the issue of restructuring the PLO in order to include Hamas is one of the more difficult ones to resolve because it is related to reaching agreement on a single political program.</s> <s i="32">Without such agreement, restructuring the PLO will be hard.</s> 

<s i="33">This dialogue with Hamas will not resemble the one Abu Mazen undertook in Mecca in February 2007, which led to the establishment of a national unity government.</s> <s i="34">First, the context is different, since we are not witnessing international consensus in objection, and secondly Israel is already in indirect negotiations with Hamas in Gaza.</s> 

<s i="35">Moreover, the aims are different.</s> <s i="36">Abu Mazen, who is still convinced of the negotiations path with Israel despite the absence of tangible results, is not looking for a national unity government with Hamas that might bring back the Israeli and American boycott.</s> <s i="37">Rather, he is negotiating for a transitional and agreed-upon government of independent personalities, to prepare for elections on the one hand and give him the space to pursue negotiations in quiet with the hope of reaching agreement by the end of this year, on the other.</s>
