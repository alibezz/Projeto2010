<s i="0">In all societies, youth are the ones who actually fight wars; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is no exception.</s> <s i="1">Israeli youth fill the ranks of the IDF; Palestinian youth populate the diverse groups that fought two intifadas and carry out suicide bombings.</s> 

<s i="2">Youth also bear the demographic message of the future.</s> <s i="3">In Gaza, for example, the population is heavily weighted in favor of youth, thereby guaranteeing social, economic and political crisis as it doubles roughly every generation.</s> <s i="4">In Israel, ultra-orthodox Jews and Arab citizens will constitute nearly half of all 18 year-olds ten years from now, presenting the disturbing specter of only half the population doing military service and bearing an increasingly heavy security burden unless radical changes are introduced to Israeli society.</s>

<s i="5">Youth also embody idealism and initiative to a far greater extent than most adults.</s> <s i="6">Recently, I came across two very positive examples of this in the context of the Israel-Arab dispute--at least from an Israeli point of view--in two very different forums.</s> 

<s i="7">First, at an international convocation that brought together people from all over the Middle East, I was approached by a group of university students from one of the Gulf emirates.</s> <s i="8">They had never met Israelis, they explained breathlessly; this was their first opportunity.</s> <s i="9">They had so much to talk about.</s> <s i="10">Could I arrange for them to meet a similar group of Israeli students?</s> <s i="11">If only, I mused, this sort of initiative could be multiplied a thousand-fold.</s>

<s i="12">Second, at a high school graduation in Israel--a school in the Tel Aviv area where a disturbing percentage of the student body find ways to avoid military service--the valedictorian chose to berate the school's administration and faculty for not doing enough to encourage students to serve and was applauded loudly by his fellow students and their parents.</s> 

<s i="13">Here is the place to note that in Israel, military service from age 18 to 21 tends to correspond later in life with social and political involvement of the sort needed if we are ever to reach accommodation with our Palestinian neighbors.</s> <s i="14">Most Israeli youth defend their country willingly and well.</s> <s i="15">True, we also have a fringe of radical youth who are involved with protest movements; a few of them call themselves &quot;anarchists&quot; and demonstrate violently against the security fence.</s> 

<s i="16">I don't believe anarchism can contribute to peace.</s> <s i="17">But youth are the only age group really capable of staging a massive ideological rebellion against the ideas represented by the older generation.</s> <s i="18">This doesn't happen to every society or every generation, but when it does it can have a sweeping effect on the course of history.</s> <s i="19">The Zionist movement at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century in many ways represents such a rebellion, whereby members of a young generation of mainly European Jews rejected two thousand years of Jewish teaching and opted for Jewish nationalism in Palestine.</s> <s i="20">The outcome, while profound and vital for the Jewish people, has also manifested itself in seemingly endless Arab-Israel conflict.</s> 

<s i="21">The jihadi youth of Sunni Islam who hail from all over the Arab world and sacrifice everything to offer themselves as suicide bombers for groups ranging from Hamas to al-Qaeda also appear to represent such a youth revolt, albeit one that focuses on a death-cult and that should deeply concern their elders.</s> <s i="22">Sadly, in too many areas of today's world and particularly in many Arab and Muslim countries, indoctrination trumps education and, in the words of Karl Popper, ideas are more important than individual people.</s> <s i="23">As a dedicated Zionist myself, I recognize that in some ways I too have to confront this contradiction and find the right balance between the national values I believe in and the rights of individuals swept up in the conflict.</s> 

 <s i="24">&quot;Individuals&quot; is the definition we must give to most Israeli youth today: they are both more global and less ideological in orientation than their fathers and mothers.</s> <s i="25">What are the obligations of the older generation, represented by this writer, to these youth with respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?</s> <s i="26">It seems to me that we are duty bound not only to educate the younger generations; we also owe them a more peaceful and productive world.</s> 

<s i="27">Yet we are doing neither.</s> <s i="28">The Israeli education system is in prolonged crisis, brought on by a society that has devalued the formal preparation of coming generations.</s> <s i="29">If we produce dedicated and capable youth it is in many cases despite the system, not thanks to it.</s> <s i="30">We haven't even taught most of our children Arabic, the language they will need if ever we are to live at peace with our neighbors.</s>
