<s i="0">What happened in Gaza last week was a revolution in more ways than one.</s> <s i="1">Not only was this a coup d'etat at the internal Palestinian level, but it also generated a broader revolutionary situation in our part of the Middle East.</s> <s i="2">It demolished more than a few fundamental or historic assumptions about the nature and future of Israeli-Palestinian, Palestinian-Palestinian and Palestinian-Arab relations.</s> 

<s i="3">Given the strategic dimension of this change we can for the moment only speculate concerning developments in the near future.</s> <s i="4">Anyone who purports today to speak with authority and certainty about what's ahead is skating on thin ice.</s>

<s i="5">In order to sharpen our appreciation of the issues at hand, here are two extreme scenarios for upcoming developments as seen from an Israeli perspective.</s> <s i="6">The most likely course of developments almost certainly lies somewhere in between them.</s> 

<s i="7">At the optimistic end of the spectrum, Israel relatively successfully and peacefully manages its relations with two very different Palestinian leaderships on two fronts.</s> <s i="8">In the West Bank, President Mahmoud Abbas consolidates Fateh's control, stabilizes security and accepts to deal with Israel and the international community on behalf of the West Bank alone.</s> <s i="9">The new Salam Fayyad government receives tax money from Israel and aid from Europe and America, and the West Bank prospers.</s> <s i="10">Abbas begins negotiating an interim agreement with PM Ehud Olmert that involves Israeli withdrawal from territory and dismantling of additional settlements.</s>

<s i="11">Meanwhile in Gaza, Hamas, now in exclusive control, confronts the need to maintain security in order to continue to receive infrastructure and food supplies and export agricultural and other goods.</s> <s i="12">Israel links the opening of the Gaza passages to the absence of Qassam rockets falling on Sderot and its surroundings as well as a prisoner exchange.</s> <s i="13">Israel and Egypt impose an effective arms embargo.</s> <s i="14">The government in Gaza confronts Palestinian public anger over its brutality and Egyptian determination to constrain it, and becomes more pragmatic.</s>

<s i="15">In contrast, at the pessimistic end of the spectrum, the organizational and leadership weakness demonstrated by Abbas and Fateh in Gaza last week continues to characterize their performance in the West Bank.</s> <s i="16">Hamas makes inroads there, and together with disparate elements launches terror attacks against Israel.</s> <s i="17">This renders Israeli-Palestinian security, economic and political cooperation in the West Bank impossible.</s> <s i="18">Meanwhile in Gaza, the dominant Hamas military wing moves from internal takeover to exporting violence to Israel.</s> <s i="19">It also attacks targets in Egyptian Sinai, as Egypt fails to remedy its sloppy effort to police the Gaza-Sinai border.</s> <s i="20">Israel responds with major military strikes into Gaza, where chaos and crisis spread.</s> <s i="21">Iran, sensing that Israel has been put on the defensive on two Palestinian fronts, encourages its Syrian and Lebanese Shi'ite allies to launch a third.</s>

<s i="22">If we do try to deal more specifically with anticipated events, it seems easier at this juncture to identify a number of much-discussed developments that are almost certain not to take place.</s>

<s i="23">First, under present and likely near-term circumstances there will be no international force in Gaza.</s> <s i="24">No third country will volunteer to place its troops between Israel and Hamas or (on the Gaza-Sinai &quot;philadelphi&quot; border) between Egypt and Hamas.</s> <s i="25">For a peace-keeping force to succeed in the Middle East it needs both a peace agreement to maintain and two viable and responsible governments to work with.</s> <s i="26">Hamas does not qualify.</s> <s i="27">In any event, its Damascus-based leader, Khaled Meshaal, has rejected the idea.</s>   

<s i="28">Second, whatever new Saudi- or Egyptian-mediated efforts to reform a Palestinian unity government emerge, there will be no genuine reconciliation between Fateh and Hamas or, for that matter, between Israel and Hamas.</s> <s i="29">The lines are drawn between a radical Islamist Arab regime on the shores of the Mediterranean--and the rest of us.</s>

<s i="30">Third, no matter how badly Hamas treats its own people or antagonizes Israel, the latter will not permit the emergence of a total humanitarian crisis and mass starvation in Gaza.</s>

<s i="31">Fourth, an Israeli-Palestinian political process confined to the West Bank could conceivably provide a helpful confidence-building boost and contribute conflict management.</s> <s i="32">But given both Abbas' and Olmert's weakness and Hamas' capacity to interfere, we should not expect anything resembling a full-fledged peace process.</s>

<s i="33">And finally, Israeli illusions aside, neither Egypt nor Jordan is about to take over responsibility for, respectively, Gaza and the West Bank, thereby letting Israel &quot;off the hook&quot;.</s> <s i="34">Egypt, on the contrary, is eliminating its diplomatic and military advisory presence in Gaza; hopefully, the penny has finally dropped in Cairo and the Mubarak regime will start to treat Hamas as part of the opposition to its regime.</s> 

<s i="35">As for Jordan, a successful re-launching of an Israeli-Palestinian political process on the West Bank could hopefully open up opportunities for closer East Bank-West Bank cooperation.</s> <s i="36">But it is very doubtful that King Abdullah in Amman would be tempted to attach more Palestinians to his kingdom and reinstate their Jordanian citizenship.</s>
