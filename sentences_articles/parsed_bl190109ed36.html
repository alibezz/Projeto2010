<s i="0">It is a truism of international relations in the last several decades that the Middle East has an endearing quality of imposing itself on the international agenda.</s> <s i="1">It inserts itself forcefully into news cycles even when uninvited and thoroughly unwelcome.</s> <s i="2">The case of President-elect Barack Obama is no exception.</s> <s i="3">In the past three weeks, and predictably rolling into his first weeks in office and irrespective of a ceasefire, he will find that you can pretend to be running from this violent and intractable region, but you cannot hide for more than a few days.</s> <s i="4">Especially if you are the president of the United States of America.</s> 

<s i="5">What the new Obama administration wants in the broader Middle East and what Israel would like to see taking shape in the Gaza Strip are essentially the same thing, but on a different scale: &quot;Change we can believe in&quot;.</s> <s i="6">Obama wants this change to occur gradually throughout the region.</s> <s i="7">Israel will be content with a significant change in its relations with Hamas in Gaza.</s>

<s i="8">The current crisis in Gaza has two clear implications for US policy at this almost pre-introductory phase of its formation.</s> <s i="9">First, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has dramatically moved up on the priority list and may very well be the number one foreign policy issue that requires Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's immediate attention and policy planning.</s> <s i="10">In a sense, it is also an early test of their resolve and commitment to change outgoing President George W. Bush's foreign policy.</s> 

<s i="11">Second, it positions the Israeli-Palestinian issue ahead of the Israeli-Syrian track.</s> <s i="12">Many in the incoming foreign policy establishment in Washington entertained the thought of a &quot;Syria first&quot; policy.</s> <s i="13">Syria is a country with which, supposedly, Israel has only a territorial dispute.</s> <s i="14">Negotiations are 
seemingly 
simpler, the contours are clearer and the issues have already been more or less explored, studied, negotiated and exhausted.</s> <s i="15">The Syria-first option's relation to a possible &quot;isolate Iran&quot; policy is almost self-evident.</s> <s i="16">Simply put, all the administration has to do is to wipe the thin layer of dust off the December 2006 Baker-Hamilton &quot;Iraq Study Group Report&quot; and adopt it verbatim.</s>

<s i="17">However, the Gaza crisis notwithstanding, the Obama-Clinton administration will quickly find out that Israelis in general, and the new prime minister elected in February in particular, are more inclined to deal with a Palestinian process than with Syria.</s> <s i="18">Evacuating 85-95 percent of the West Bank is perceived as a political and demographic imperative by roughly 70 percent of Israelis, including substantial parts of the political right, provided the agreement is durable and sustainable.</s> <s i="19">The Golan Heights are a different story.</s> <s i="20">Israelis feel they understand the concrete value of the Golan and value the price of relinquishing control over it, but find it naturally difficult to envision the amorphous positive strategic returns, a much more intangible concept called &quot;peace with Syria&quot;.</s> <s i="21">They also feel no urgent need to do so at this moment.</s>

<s i="22">Consequently, the Obama administration will be impelled to invest original thought, expend political energy and capital, spend time and perhaps risk international reputation and stature in this complex and almost insoluble conflict.</s> <s i="23">It is axiomatic that Obama will be looking for a Middle East policy that is perceived as a clear departure from that of George W. Bush.</s> <s i="24">Therefore, he will feel compelled to act quickly on Gaza so the Arab world will not interpret his policy as a continuation of Bush's.

It is safe to assume that several basic tenets of Obama's foreign policy will be in play here.</s> <s i="25">First, he will actively seek multilateralism and try to engage other countries: France, Egypt, the EU as a bloc and later perhaps even Russia.</s> <s i="26">Second, Obama will strive to reassert American power in the Middle East.</s> <s i="27">Engaging other countries is a gallant and smart idea, but not at the expense of American dominance.</s> <s i="28">Despite an economic crisis and financial meltdown of historic proportions, America effectively remains the world's only superpower for the time being.</s> <s i="29">It is the only country capable of projecting diplomatic, political, military, technological and, yes, even economic power simultaneously.</s> <s i="30">Third, Obama (and Hillary Clinton) believe in the power of diplomacy and will--at least at the beginning--exhibit more consideration and lend more weight to international institutions than Bush did.</s>

<s i="31">There are 20 days between Obama's inauguration and the Israeli elections.</s> <s i="32">Three or four weeks after that, circa mid-March, a new Israeli prime minister will take office.</s> <s i="33">By early April, he/she will be unofficially ordained by virtue of the traditional first visit to the White House.</s> <s i="34">(It should be noted for Obama's sake that he will also inevitably have to meet the prime minister elected in Israel's following elections, too, while still in his first term of office.) This means that there are a full 75 days between now and then, 75 days in which the crisis has to be diffused before a broader policy can be crafted and presented.</s>
