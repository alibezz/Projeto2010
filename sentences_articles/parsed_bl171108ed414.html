<s i="0">It has been a week since the ill-fated Palestinian reconciliation talks in Cairo came to a screeching halt even before the opening session; accusations as to who is to blame for their demise are still rife.</s> <s i="1">Most fingers, however, are pointed at Hamas, who at virtually the last second called the whole thing off.</s> <s i="2">It is a tight race as to who came out the biggest loser in this most recent botched attempt to put Humpty Dumpty back together again, but it is fair to say that Egypt, the sponsor of the talks, is pretty high up on the list.</s> 

<s i="3">For months, Egypt has tried its hand at bringing Palestinian factions--mainly Hamas and Fateh--to the negotiating table to somehow hammer out an agreement that would result in the formation of a national unity government.</s> <s i="4">In theory, 11 factions were to travel to Cairo for the talks, but in practice, all but Hamas and Fateh have been marginalized given the dichotomized state of Palestinian society between the two rivals, the former in charge of the West Bank and the latter ruling the Gaza Strip.</s> 

<s i="5">Needless to say, over the past several months Egypt has hosted both parties on its turf and in Palestine to negotiate the terms of an agreement, ultimately culminating in the scheduled and much-anticipated November 10 reconciliation talks in Cairo.</s> <s i="6">While Hamas especially had several reservations over Egypt's draft proposal for the talks, its last-minute change of heart came as a surprise to many.</s> <s i="7">The immediate reason given by the movement was the Palestinian Authority's refusal to release what Hamas says are over 200 of its members from West Bank jails.</s> <s i="8">Even though the Palestinian government in the West Bank adamantly denies it is holding Palestinians on political grounds, saying all those in its prisons are being held on criminal charges, the accusation stuck and Egypt hastily announced that talks would be postponed at Hamas' request.</s>

<s i="9">The question of blame is almost secondary when the grave consequences of this failure are considered.</s> <s i="10">Palestinians are in dire need of national unity and are, at this point, seemingly hell-bent on never achieving it.</s> <s i="11">Since Hamas was the obvious cop-out in the talks, all eyes are on it and why it believes it was in its best interest not to go to Cairo.</s> 

<s i="12">Finger pointing aside, the hard facts of the situation are enough to understand why achieving a national consensus is such a gargantuan task.</s> <s i="13">For Hamas, any prospect of a national government obviously entails a relinquishment of the absolute power it now enjoys over the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="14">Hamas says it wants national unity and has its people's best interests at heart, which may very well be true.</s> <s i="15">However, these sentiments seem to have been trumped by its own interests and desire to rule.</s> 

<s i="16">For Hamas, there is also the questionability of the broker, Egypt.</s> <s i="17">Since its military takeover of the Strip in June 2007, the Hamas-Egyptian relationship has been turbulent at best, explosive at worst.</s> <s i="18">The most tangible manifestation of this strained relationship occurred in January 2008 when Gazans stormed the Rafah crossing, tore down its fences and walls and stampeded into Egyptian territory in order to break the Israeli-imposed siege on the Strip.</s> <s i="19">Several Egyptian policemen were injured in the melee before the crossing was resealed by Egypt.</s> 

<s i="20">The Rafah crossing has been a constant sore spot between the de facto Hamas government and Egypt, which has often found itself between a rock and a hard place.</s> <s i="21">As one of the more moderate Arab states clearly aligned with the West, Egypt has often found itself under western and Israeli pressure to tighten its grip on Hamas, mainly by closing the crossing and clamping down on the hundreds of underground tunnels dug between Gaza and Egypt.</s> <s i="22">Hence, Hamas has always taken Egyptian mediation with a grain of salt, interpreting its helping hand as one that is in cohorts with the PA to cast it aside, or at least neutralize its power.</s> <s i="23">Power, Hamas believes, is its legitimate right given that it won Legislative Council elections in 2006 fair and square.</s> 

<s i="24">By postponing the talks, which many say was a decision taken by Hamas leaders outside, Hamas is hoping to buy time and therefore wait for international circumstances--i.e., the new American administration--that will perhaps shape up to be more acquiescing to its agenda.</s> <s i="25">The so-called &quot;external influences&quot; are also said to be a factor in the decision, in this case Iran, which wants to maintain some sort of stronghold in the Palestinian arena through the Islamic movement.</s> 

<s i="26">The same can be said of Fateh.</s> <s i="27">Already at an advantage with Egypt mediating, an Arab country that tows its political line and is looking for a moderate government to rule the Palestinians, President Mahmoud Abbas' main goal is to restore control over the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="28">Since Fateh's forces have already proven to be militarily inferior to Hamas', Fateh figured Egyptian mediation and international pressure were its best bet.</s> <s i="29">It still does, especially now that everyone, including Egypt, is blaming Hamas for the failure of the Cairo talks.</s> <s i="30">For Fateh, Hamas' bailout may have served its best interests, with international sympathies swaying even further toward the PA and the Arabs growing increasingly weary of the domestic Palestinian mess.</s> <s i="31">Hamas' refusal to relinquish control--whether legitimate or not--may just have the opposite effect and result in the movement's complete loss of political control over Gaza.</s>
