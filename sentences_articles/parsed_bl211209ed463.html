<s i="0">For good but different reasons, their respective relations with the United States are of central and utmost importance to both Palestinians and Israelis.</s> 

<s i="1">As the US is the world's leading power, it is the most influential potential mediator between them.</s> <s i="2">Israel is completely dependent for its overwhelming superiority on the near unquestioned military, economic and diplomatic support it receives from the US.</s> <s i="3">The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, is dependent on international support and international diplomacy, both shaped by the US.</s> 

<s i="4">Moreover, since the beginning of the peace process in 1991, the US has always played the leading mediating role, albeit to mixed reactions.</s> <s i="5">On the one hand, both sides hold the US responsible for the shortcomings of that peace process, each for its own reasons.</s> <s i="6">On the other hand, they also feel that the process could not move forward without serious US involvement.</s>

<s i="7">There are of course fundamental differences in the relations between the two sides and the US.</s> <s i="8">America makes no secret of its support for and bias toward Israel.</s> <s i="9">This has caused the Palestinians to seek a greater role for other international actors in mediating the conflict as a way to mitigate this imbalance.</s> <s i="10">The last round of negotiations, the Annapolis process, for instance, is an example of a process undertaken purely for American and Israeli interests.</s> <s i="11">Israel needed to create an impression that it was involved in a serious process primarily for the domestic purposes of the then Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert.</s> <s i="12">The US administration, meanwhile, had been heavily criticized for not paying the conflict any attention and wanted to provide it some lip service at the last moment.</s> 

<s i="13">By contrast, when the current American administration under President Barack Obama took over, Washington initially showed a keen interest in pursuing a more serious and extensive engagement.</s> <s i="14">This was signaled from the outset with the appointment of George Mitchell as special envoy.</s> <s i="15">As a result, the two sides become even more focused and sensitive about their respective relations with Washington.</s>

<s i="16">The Palestinians became a little more hopeful for the same reason that the Israelis felt a little more tense: a serious process would of necessity have to be based on international legality.</s> <s i="17">This in turn would expose the contradiction between the requirements of international legality and the position of the right-wing Israeli coalition government under Binyamin Netanyahu, which is based on continued control over the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and continued expansion of Jewish settlements there.</s> 

<s i="18">Israel dealt with the situation in two ways, through public relations and by playing domestic US politics.</s> <s i="19">First, the Israeli government engaged in a public relations campaign to head off any potential US pressure without at the same time having to make fundamental changes to government policy.</s> <s i="20">Thus Netanyahu announced a settlement construction &quot;freeze&quot; that is so only in name.</s> <s i="21">Before that he had announced an &quot;acceptance&quot; of the two-state solution so qualified that it similarly meant no such thing.</s> 

<s i="22">In both cases, Netanyahu overcame the potential contradiction between his position and that of the US with a public relations strategy that provided Israel with a pro-active and well-intentioned demeanor belying its actual intransigence.</s> <s i="23">Meanwhile, Israel utilized its supporters in the US to exploit the president's tussle with the US Congress over other issues.</s> <s i="24">At this point in time it appears to have worked, and the US administration has backed down from its earlier enthusiasm for tackling the conflict.</s>
