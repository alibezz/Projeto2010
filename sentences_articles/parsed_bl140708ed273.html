<s i="0">Why is it that all Arab initiatives to bring about dialogue between Fateh and Hamas have failed to produce the intended result?</s> <s i="1">Why is it that even Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' own initiative failed to yield what was expected of it?</s> <s i="2">Is it because behind all the sweet public announcements by Hamas and Fateh about their &quot;readiness to talk&quot; lies a fundamental lack of interest?</s> <s i="3">Or is it because Arab intervention has not been as serious as it should be if it is to replicate the Arab-sponsored Doha mediation between the Lebanese political factions?</s> <s i="4">Is it actually because of an Israeli-American veto on any rapprochement between Fateh and Hamas that would lead once again to the inclusion of the latter in the Palestinian Authority without it unequivocally accepting the conditions laid down by the Quartet?</s> 

<s i="5">It would seem that a combination of these three explanations contributes to continued stagnation on the Palestinian scene.</s> <s i="6">Beginning from the end, there is indeed an Israeli-American veto that plays a significant role in influencing the PA and many Arab capitals.</s> <s i="7">It is rather obvious that Israel wants to impose a settlement on the Palestinians.</s> <s i="8">For Israel the real issue is not the Gaza Strip, but East Jerusalem and the West Bank of which it wants to annex a good portion.</s> <s i="9">In line with its policy of &quot;divide and conquer&quot;, Israel's interest is best served by a deepening of the internal Palestinian rift.</s> <s i="10">It believes that Abbas (Abu Mazen) is weak, and his party, Fateh, is in a state of disarray.</s> <s i="11">This means Israel can continue negotiating with Abu Mazen while creating facts on the ground through its settlement policy.</s> <s i="12">Israel does not actually care if Hamas is content ruling Gaza; rather it might prefer it as long as a truce holds and rockets are not fired at Israeli towns.</s> <s i="13">Israel might even be entertaining the idea that Hamas is more amenable than Abu Mazen and Fateh to accept a future &quot;interim solution&quot; with a &quot;temporary Palestinian state&quot;.</s> <s i="14">The US administration will go along with whatever Israel decides it wants.</s> 

<s i="15">With respect to the two Palestinian parties, neither seems to have any interest in compromise.</s> <s i="16">Rather, both want the other to bow to their conditions.</s> <s i="17">Abu Mazen is slowly asphyxiating from the prolonged negotiations with successive Israeli governments that have yielded no other result than the continued expansion of settlements on occupied Palestinian land.</s> <s i="18">Because his only strategic option is to reach a political settlement through negotiations, Abu Mazen's hopes rest with the Americans and Israelis.</s> <s i="19">Thus, not to upset these sources of hope, any dialogue he might undertake with Hamas can not produce tangible results unless Hamas accepts the Israeli-American conditions, a.k.a. the Quartet conditions.</s> <s i="20">Hamas, on the other hand, is also not in a hurry to reach a compromise with Abu Mazen, unless its conditions are accepted in whole.</s> <s i="21">Within the rank and file of Hamas there is a widespread belief that things are going to fall their way since the negotiations with Israel will not produce even the minimal conditions acceptable to the Palestinian people.</s> <s i="22">Meanwhile, Hamas will use the time and the truce, if it holds, to strengthen its hold over Gaza.</s> <s i="23">When 2008 ends, Hamas will be in a better bargaining position, not only with Abu Mazen, but with Israel.</s> 

<s i="24">With the above in mind, it should be obvious why Arab mediation in domestic Palestinian affairs is being kept on the back burner.</s> <s i="25">Apart from American influence, no Arab capital wants a repeat of the Mecca agreement.</s> <s i="26">If the Palestinians cannot respect the wishes and good offices of the Saudis, with all their leverage, and uphold an agreement reached in the holiest Islamic site, would they respect it if reached elsewhere?</s> <s i="27">What has changed to convince any Arab capital to put its weight behind a new mediation attempt?</s> 

<s i="28">The only current concern for Cairo, which has its hands tied by its good relations with Washington, is not to mend fences between Palestinians but rather to save itself from the embarrassment caused by the continued closure of the Rafah crossing that has left the Gaza Strip suffering a severe siege.</s> <s i="29">The Egyptian priority now is to solidify the truce between Hamas and Israel in order to find a solution to the siege through which the Rafah crossing can start operating again.</s> <s i="30">The Egyptians do not want a repeat of the scenes witnessed in late January when Gazans stormed the border, because Cairo does not want to be forced to shoot at Palestinians should this happen again.</s> 

<s i="31">Damascus is busy trying to mend fences with the international community, more specifically with the US and France.</s> <s i="32">Syria is consumed by three key strategic issues, and Hamas is not one of them.</s> <s i="33">First, the Syrians are extremely keen to spare their regime the international investigation into the murder of Rafiq al-Hariri.</s> <s i="34">Second, Damascus wants to get its Golan Heights back from Israel.</s> <s i="35">And third, Syria wants to retain its influence in Lebanon.</s> <s i="36">Therefore, neither Hamas nor even Iran are strategic issues for the Syrians, who are not going to play an active role in Palestinian affairs.</s> <s i="37">Nor will they hinder any progress on that front.</s> <s i="38">They will simply leave events to take their own course.</s>
