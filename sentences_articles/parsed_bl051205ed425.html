<s i="0">The Palestinian and Israeli political realities have been inextricably linked since the start of the occupation in 1967.</s> <s i="1">Their amalgamation has been both mutual and escalatory to the extent that it is no longer possible to address one without taking into consideration the other.</s> <s i="2">But there has never been a time when the intensity of this interrelatedness and its various ramifications has been more apparent then in the past few months.</s> <s i="3">The postponement until January of Palestinian Legislative Council elections and the earlier-than-anticipated general Israeli elections this March has brought this intermingling between Palestinian and Israeli political lives to a peak.</s> 

<s i="4">The results of the Palestinian elections will lead to a core change in the nature of the Palestinian political system and the fashion in which it operates.</s> <s i="5">These parliamentary elections, and not the presidential elections, are the key to the crucial democratic transformation this &quot;patriarchal&quot; system needs.</s> <s i="6">The system's internal political legitimacy sprang from the authority of the late Yasser Arafat's charismatic leadership.</s> <s i="7">This overwhelming individual control led to a complete absence of a separation of authorities, a continuous marginalization of the role of institutions and a limitation on their political effectiveness.</s> <s i="8">It also led to a severe reduction of any political participation in the decision-making process.</s> <s i="9">All authority lay with the president.</s> <s i="10">All aspects of the Palestinian political process were concentrated in his hands, and he maneuvered it at whim.</s> <s i="11">He was the Palestinian political system; no decision was made without his knowledge and nothing was carried out except on his orders.</s> <s i="12">There were no constraints on the extent of his rule.</s> 

<s i="13">Hence, Israeli and international efforts were, up to the convening of the Camp David summit, focused on attempts to satisfy Arafat personally in order to reach a political settlement that would be desirable to Israel.</s> <s i="14">When this summit failed, there was no longer a Palestinian political system to be dealt with for these players while Arafat remained on the scene.</s> 

<s i="15">The change began with the death of Arafat.</s> <s i="16">But the election of Mahmoud Abbas, with his reserved personality and the different capabilities from Arafat that he brought, was not alone enough to create the democratic leap or the move toward a political settlement.</s> <s i="17">Legislative elections were necessary to transfer the legitimacy from its individual-based foundations--revolutionary/historical/charismatic, all found in Arafat--to the legal-institutional level needed to empower Abbas.</s> 

<s i="18">However, when Abbas declared his intention to hold elections, two extremely important and unexpected things happened: the opposition factions, first and foremost Hamas, declared their intention to run; and the inevitable beginnings of change in the internal state of Fateh began to appear with a shift of parliamentary leadership to the younger generation.</s>  

<s i="19">These two surprises will result in a radical transformation of the political system, how it operates and its political approaches.</s> <s i="20">The system will become more institutionalized and the president will no longer be its principal pivot.</s> <s i="21">Rather, this pivot will shift to the Legislative Council, which will operate according to parliamentary foundations and contain a strong opposition.</s> 

<s i="22">This democratic transformation will result in more internal stability for the Palestinian political system but will also result in a council more stringent and scrutinizing over the negotiations process.</s> <s i="23">As a result, no political settlement unjust to Palestinian rights will be signed.</s> 

<s i="24">On the Israeli side, meanwhile, the resignation of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon from the Likud party and the formation of his new party, Kadima, shook up the Israeli political system.</s> <s i="25">Sharon's current popularity comes from a belief by many Israelis that he is the politician best capable of dealing with security and reaching a political settlement that will ensure maximum Israeli gains.</s> <s i="26">The outcome of Palestinian elections will likely be considered by most Israelis as extreme and undesirable, especially with the inclusion of Hamas and the young Fateh generation in the PLC, and that fact, coupled with the personalities who abandoned their parties to join Kadima, such as Shimon Peres, will most likely lead to a Sharon victory.</s> <s i="27">Such a victory will unshackle Sharon from right-wing extremists whose influence will be reduced in the new Israeli political system.</s> <s i="28">It will also grant him an overall mandate to move forward to fulfill his and Peres' vision of a settlement with the Palestinians that will not anger the world, the United States in particular.</s> 

<s i="29">It should be noted, however, that this transformation in the Israeli political system is not based, as many think, on a shift by Sharon from the right to the center but rather on a shift of the center toward Sharon, whose place is still in the Israeli right-wing camp.</s>  

<s i="30">Sharon has already declared his acceptance of US President George Bush's vision of a settlement based on the principle of two states, thereby implying that he does not oppose the establishment of a Palestinian &quot;state&quot;.</s> <s i="31">However, ever since, he has been unilaterally designating the boundaries of this &quot;state&quot; on the ground according to Israeli conditions, which include the previous government's opposition to the internationally-supported roadmap.</s> 

<s i="32">What this means is that Sharon wants to give Palestinians a &quot;leftover state&quot;--a state without full independence or complete sovereignty and which is established on whatever land Israel cannot annex because of dense Palestinian population concentration.</s> <s i="33">Annexing these areas would lead to an imbalance, from a Jewish-Israeli perspective, in the demographic reality and would eventually transform Israel into a bi-national state.</s> <s i="34">This is why Sharon carried out his unilateral withdrawal from inside the Gaza Strip while continuing settlement construction in the West Bank, isolating Jerusalem from its surroundings, completing the separation wall and establishing cantons to squeeze the Palestinians into the smallest possible geographically scattered spots within the West Bank, while maintaining the Jordan Valley as an isolated security zone under Israeli control.</s> <s i="35">These are the characteristics of the settlement Sharon wants to impose on the Palestinians and on the world by creating facts on the ground, and this settlement will constitute his political platform after the elections.</s> 

<s i="36">What then will be the political outcome of the elections?</s> <s i="37">Will they be a glimmer of hope for a possible breakthrough?</s> <s i="38">Or will they lead to another dead end for reaching an acceptable rather than imposed political settlement?</s>
