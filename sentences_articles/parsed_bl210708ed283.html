<s i="0">As of this moment, the state of affairs between us and the Arabs is discouraging from the Israeli standpoint and encouraging from the Arab point of view.</s> <s i="1">Everything appears to have been reversed: if in the past Israel relied on its wiles and the Arabs fell for its ruses, now the relationship has been turned upside down, as so often happens in life.</s>

<s i="2">Again and again, we encounter this reversal of roles.</s> <s i="3">Once, unable to deal with the superiority of Israel's cunning, the Arabs were sustained by delusions or waited for miracles.</s> <s i="4">Now the situation is topsy-turvy: the Arabs rely on cunning and the Israelis grasp at useless dreams.</s>

<s i="5">If in the past Israel was reputed to be a country that would do everything to avoid abandoning its wounded or captured soldiers and the Arabs were thought of as disdaining these values, here too things have been reversed.</s> <s i="6">The one who strives to bring his warriors home alive is the enemy, not Israel.</s> <s i="7">We are led astray and swallow lies.</s>

<s i="8">Instead of thinking of tomorrow, Israeli strategy chases after yesterday.</s> <s i="9">Had we done the right thing at the right time, there would never have evolved a situation in which we embarked on a lost cause to &quot;bring our sons home&quot;.</s> <s i="10">Had we made a timely deal with a weak, confused and embattled Syrian president who was begging for rescue through international recognition--not only would the abduction have been avoided but the unnecessary and pathetic war that followed as well.</s>

<s i="11">Now, not only has our societal weakness been exposed, relying on oaths and witchcraft instead of brainpower, but we are being drawn into another obvious tailspin leading to yet another war in the north, this time apparently with Syria itself.</s> <s i="12">Only after the next bloodletting will we be obliged to withdraw from the Golan Heights in return for a far less welcome deal than what we could have gotten from a weak and needy Assad two or three years ago.</s> <s i="13">Thus are the pretentious and the arrogant punished.</s> <s i="14">Thus are those who rely on their American patrons instead of on themselves--those who pursue the past rather than planning the future--dealt with.</s>

<s i="15">The situation is similar on the Palestinian front.</s> <s i="16">Just as negotiations with Hizballah became an arena of illusions and no real deal was ever made--there was no &quot;prisoner exchange&quot; and our sons were never &quot;brought home&quot;--so there is no real deal on the Palestinian horizon, either.</s> <s i="17">Everything is virtual, in keeping with the computerized internet age we live in.</s> <s i="18">Realities on the ground are immaterial, greed and arrogance control consciousness and thinking is directed toward instant gratification instead of understanding where we're going.</s>

<s i="19">To concentrate day after day on ransoming prisoners is to view reality through a keyhole.</s> <s i="20">What the Middle East needs today--as in the past, only more so--is fresh rather than routine thinking.</s> <s i="21">The morass we are sinking into is mainly in our minds.</s> <s i="22">It is easier to focus on captured IDF soldier Gilad Shalit--though here too we don't emerge as geniuses at negotiation--than on the future of our relationship with Hamas.</s> 

<s i="23">Just as the problems between us and Hizballah will be resolved by solving the equation with Syria, so we'll solve the Shalit issue only when we reach the necessary far-reaching conclusions regarding the reality we share with Hamas.</s> <s i="24">But meanwhile we live in a virtual reality in which we have no problem deluding the entire world.</s> <s i="25">To negotiate with someone whose company at the table you enjoy and to draft terms of a contract that will never be implemented has, by the way, always been the Jewish philosophy of survival: gaining time.</s> <s i="26">It never really proved itself; it certainly doesn't when the Jews are running a sovereign state.</s>
