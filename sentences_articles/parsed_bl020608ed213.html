 <s i="0">Clearly, the conduct of negotiations by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's government with Syria, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas has an Israeli political dimension.</s> <s i="1">Yet it is easy to misunderstand this relationship.</s>

<s i="2">Olmert's unpopularity and link to strong allegations of corruption give him an incentive to conduct such talks.</s> <s i="3">His basic argument is: I'm engaged in such important efforts to achieve peace as to render unimportant all these other petty issues.</s> <s i="4">Stop distracting me.</s>

<s i="5">But two other neglected points must be added.</s> <s i="6">First, this message is primarily aimed at the political left and the Israeli media.</s> <s i="7">By saying he's working for peace, Olmert believes--with good reason--that they won't criticize him.</s> <s i="8">Second, by the same token, this gambit makes him more unpopular with the right.</s>  

<s i="9">Additionally, Israeli public opinion is generally cynical.</s> <s i="10">It isn't against negotiations and very much wants peace but Israelis doubt that Syria, Fateh or Hamas are willing to make real peace.</s> <s i="11">Consequently, Olmert's activist policy on talks also has negative effects on his domestic popularity and political support.</s> 

<s i="12">In brief, then, Olmert may be influenced by political considerations but the result is not all positive, nor is his diplomatic strategy by any means responsible for his survival.</s> <s i="13">Parliamentary politics are far more important in this regard.</s> <s i="14">He has a majority coalition, his partners are afraid of elections and his party colleagues know that his mismanagement would lead to their destruction in case of elections.</s> <s i="15">These points--not rushing to talks, sometimes overestimating their results or making huge concessions--are the main reasons why Olmert has remained in office.</s>

<s i="16">Here there enters an important irony.</s> <s i="17">The fact is that--for reasons that cannot be fully covered in this short article--Hamas, Hizballah, Iran and Syria don't want to make peace with Israel, while Fateh (hence the PA) is entrapped in a mixture of rejection and, to the extent that some of its leaders are more moderate, weakness that prevents it from doing so.</s>

<s i="18">Given this reality, Olmert and other Israeli leaders know that achieving agreements is unlikely.</s> <s i="19">Consequently, they can engage in negotiations and offer concessions in the relative security that they will not have to implement deals.</s> <s i="20">This is not to imply that they are motivated by cynicism--they'd prefer success--but that's the situation in which they work.</s>

<s i="21">There has been withering and heated criticism of the Olmert government from the right, sometimes crossing the border to incitement.</s> <s i="22">Yet this storm has been based on the words of Olmert and the government.</s> <s i="23">It is much harder to show that their actual deeds have involved extreme unilateral concessions, jeopardizing the country's security or giving away assets for selfish political gain.</s> <s i="24">The talks have remained just that, talks.</s> <s i="25">And there is an important structural reason why this has been so, in terms of the other side's positions, interests and needs.</s>

<s i="26">An additional factor in this situation is a search to meet shorter-term goals.</s> <s i="27">Even granted that negotiations will not succeed in achieving total peace and an end to the conflict, certain things might be gained that benefit both Israel and the government.</s> <s i="28">In many cases, there can be a debate over specific ideas but they are not irrational ones.</s>

<s i="29">Most important is how this works in Israel-PA talks.</s> <s i="30">There is broad consensus in Israel that the country's interests require the survival of the PA, whose replacement by Hamas in the West Bank would create a more dangerous and violent situation.</s> <s i="31">Equally, it is vital to improve the PA's capacity to fight terrorism, improve its people's well-being and reduce the level of direct conflict.</s> <s i="32">Talks, easing tensions, some concessions and allowing the PA to get resources it needs are worthwhile pursuits even for such partial successes.</s> <s i="33">And, of course, by showing its flexibility and desire for peace, Israel also improves its relations with the West.</s>  

<s i="34">Talks with Syria have a different but parallel set of criteria.</s> <s i="35">There is the hope (which this author believes mistaken) that this might somehow lead to peace and to the detachment of Syria from its alliance with Iran.</s> <s i="36">Yet there are also more modest expectations.</s> 

<s i="37">It is important to remember that Defense Minister Ehud Barak has long believed that advancing on the Syrian track is a way to sidestep the deadlock he perceives on the Palestinian track and gain leverage over the Palestinians.</s> <s i="38">This was his policy as prime minister in 1999.</s>

<s i="39">Another goal is to give Syria an incentive to keep the Israel-Lebanon border quiet, reining in Hizballah to avoid destroying talks that also benefit itself (though the Syrian regime is uninterested in achieving peace with Israel).</s> <s i="40">In contrast to the PA policy, however, the Syria initiative arguably undermined US-Israel relations to some extent.</s>

<s i="41">Any talks with Hamas offer far less in all respects, which is one reason why they have lagged behind the other two tracks.</s>
