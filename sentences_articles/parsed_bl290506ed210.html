<s i="0">Now that it has gained President George W. Bush's support, PM Ehud Olmert's plans for unilateral withdrawal on the West Bank face mainly internal Israeli obstacles.</s> <s i="1">Yet nobody seems to understand where Israeli unilateralism came from.</s> <s i="2">The different motives assigned to Olmert's plan by Israel's friends and neighbors and by some Israelis are really quite extraordinary in their variety.</s> 

<s i="3">Palestinians, many Europeans and Arabs and some Americans argue that Israel has adopted a unilateralist posture as essentially a land-grab scheme.</s> <s i="4">By dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank mountain heartland, it plans to consolidate its grip on the settlement blocs near the green line.</s> <s i="5">The security fence, usually called an &quot;apartheid wall&quot; by these circles, is cited as the proof: most of it has been or is being built on West Bank land, beyond the 1967 armistice line (green line).</s>

<s i="6">Some Israelis on the Zionist left see Olmert's plan as a cop-out: an attempt to evade the bilateral negotiations that Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) offers and that could lead to a viable peace, essentially because Olmert and the Israeli center don't want to pay the price for peace in terms of territory.</s> <s i="7">Other Israelis, on the right, either oppose any withdrawal whatsoever or argue that the price Israel is paying for its unilateral withdrawals in terms of territory, settler hardship and encouragement of Hamas triumphalism is in no way justified by the benefits achieved.</s>

<s i="8">Prime ministers Sharon and Olmert have not always made the task of understanding unilateralism easy.</s> <s i="9">Sharon basically offered the public little by way of explanation beyond a telegraphic list of &quot;economic, security, political and demographic benefits&quot;.</s> <s i="10">Olmert has been more explicit, but still speaks in code (&quot;lifeline for Zionism&quot;) and has been unable to find an intelligent English term for his policy: first disengagement became convergence; now it is &quot;realignment&quot;, an even more confusing description.</s>

<s i="11">Yet a majority of Israelis support unilateralism, and they are not confused.</s> <s i="12">Why?</s> <s i="13">Here is my explanation.</s>

<s i="14">Around 2000-2001, something changed in Israelis' perception of their relationship with the Palestinians.</s> <s i="15">The failure at Camp David and ensuing intifada were understood as a Palestinian statement of intransigence regarding the key &quot;existential&quot; issues, the right of return of the 1948 refugees and the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem: &quot;existential&quot;, because these issues were understood as tests of Palestinian readiness to coexist with a Jewish state.</s> <s i="16">When the suicide bombings became a mass campaign, Israelis concluded that an entire society was embracing and glorifying death--its own death along with that of Israeli civilians--as its way of pursuing the conflict.</s> <s i="17">Death as a strategy also embodies an existential dimension.</s> <s i="18">A majority of Israelis reasoned that, whether by murder or through negotiations, the Palestinian leadership was plotting our destruction as a sovereign Jewish entity.</s> <s i="19">This changed the rules of the game.</s> 

<s i="20">Since 2002 this same majority, overcoming a natural reticence about building ugly fences and walls the length of the land, has supported a security barrier to keep out suicide bombers, along with the dismantling of outlying settlements to facilitate real separation from the Palestinians.</s> <s i="21">Ehud Barak's campaign slogan of 2000, &quot;they're there and we're here&quot; has become a dictum of survival.</s> <s i="22">The demographic threat has merged with the terrorist threat to boost the &quot;Jewish, democratic state&quot; slogan.</s> <s i="23">Remaining a Jewish state, which requires removing settlements that generate a destructive mix of the two populations based on a dangerous messianism, has become Israel's existential security goal.</s> <s i="24">In Israeli eyes, the fence and settlement removal move us away from apartheid rather than toward it.</s>

<s i="25">Our friends abroad ask the new Israeli mainstream what sort of Palestinian partner we are seeking for a solution in view of our reservations (albeit for very different reasons) concerning both Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and Hamas as partners.</s> <s i="26">We reply, or would reply if we allowed ourselves to be completely candid, that when confronted with a choice between a good man incapable of exercising authority and a movement that seeks our destruction, we no longer seek a partner.</s> <s i="27">They ask how we can forego the &quot;compensation&quot; embodied in an agreed solution and we respond that extracting ourselves from the Palestinian embrace is far more important.</s> <s i="28">In this sense, for many of its supporters the fence, which began as a security barrier and is now being coopted by Ehud Olmert as a unilateral, quasi-political border, is also taking on the dimensions of a fault line between civilizations.</s>

<s i="29">I know there is a measure of exaggeration in this description.</s> <s i="30">Most Israelis do understand that most Palestinians just want a decent life.</s> <s i="31">Most of us would still eagerly embrace a negotiated two state solution if it seemed fair and respectful of Israel's Jewish character and left us capable of looking after our own security and identity.</s>

<s i="32">But that's not the message we're getting from Gaza and Ramallah.</s> <s i="33">More precisely, it's one of several contradictory messages.</s> <s i="34">Palestinian polls indicate that more than half the public still supports the suicide bombings, even as it also supports a negotiated two-state solution, and even as it insists on the right of return (which contradicts a two-state solution) and chooses Hamas to govern it.</s> <s i="35">Palestinians regularly gripe about the fence and Israeli unilateralism without evincing the slightest recognition that the bombings, coupled with the perception that they seek to undermine Israel's Jewish character, brought this upon them.</s> <s i="36">This is sad, but perhaps not surprising in view of the Palestinian historical record of strategic mistakes.</s>

<s i="37">Moderate Palestinians are tragically wrong in seeing Israeli unilateralism as an unmitigated disaster.</s> <s i="38">The settlement blocs remaining in Israeli hands are little different from what Barak, Yasser Arafat and President Bill Clinton nearly agreed on six years ago at Camp David.</s> <s i="39">The fence, which is constantly being moved toward the green line, embraces no more than nine percent of the West Bank.</s> <s i="40">Even if Olmert somehow thought he could persuade the world to recognize his &quot;realignment&quot; border fence as final and official, he now acknowledges that it will be little more than the starting point for future negotiations.</s> <s i="41">Nor is Israel trying to annex the Jordan Valley--merely retain it as a security zone and future bargaining card.</s> <s i="42">So much for the &quot;land grab&quot; theory.</s> 

<s i="43">Meanwhile, Palestinians will witness the removal of dozens of hated settlements and the checkpoints and roadblocks that accompany them, without being asked for a quid pro quo.</s> <s i="44">In this way, Olmert's plan does indeed keep alive the possibility of negotiating a two-state solution once Palestinians achieve stability under a moderate and effective leadership.</s> <s i="45">Surely this is an improvement on the current situation.</s>
