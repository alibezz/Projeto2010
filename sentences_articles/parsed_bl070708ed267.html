<s i="0">When White House Spokeswoman Dana Perino went on The Daily Show, host Jon Stewart asked her if she couldn't, given US President George W. Bush's promise to &quot;sprint to the finish line&quot; of his presidency, make him run a little faster.</s> <s i="1">When it comes to Middle East peace-making (or the complete lack of it), I couldn't agree with Mr. Stewart more.</s> <s i="2">But what effect will Bush's lame duck status have on the region, on Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations and on Palestinian unity?</s> <s i="3">Potentially, quite a bit.</s> 

<s i="4">The question that must be asked first is what kind of lame bird is Bush?</s> <s i="5">While most would consider him a duck, bound to float harmlessly in a pond of tragic misadventures until January 2009, the fact of the matter is that he is still president of the most powerful country in the world.</s> <s i="6">This does not make for a reassuring six months.</s> <s i="7">For Bush junior still has the ability to wreak major havoc wherever he chooses.</s> <s i="8">We saw how he--in full regalia during his visit to the Israeli parliament--can act more like a lame buzzard than a duck.</s> 

<s i="9">More than anything else, a US president in his waning days is deeply concerned about his legacy.</s> <s i="10">And in the case of president number 43, we have a problem the size of a 10-gallon Texan cowboy hat.</s> <s i="11">Having failed in Iraq, in Afghanistan, with the economy, on the financial markets, with Russia and China and, most pathetically, in the treacherous waters of Israel/Palestine, Bush recognizes the clear and present danger that he will go down as the least successful and most disliked president in the history of the United States.</s> <s i="12">I don't care what he says about history being his judge; the man has got to do something most stunningly dramatic if he has an ice cube's chance in hell of changing that fact.</s> <s i="13">And the one place where he can still twist arms to his liking is in the hills of Jerusalem and Ramallah.</s> 

<s i="14">There at least, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is weaker than an American coffee in Rome.</s> <s i="15">And he in turn is still infinitely stronger than Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, if only because Olmert has a real country with a real army.</s> <s i="16">Both are highly susceptible to US pressure.</s> <s i="17">Hence, there remains room, no matter how minute, for maneuver.</s> 

<s i="18">Scenario I: The Lame Eagle.</s> <s i="19">Bush wakes up tomorrow and says to his wife, &quot;Laura, I had a dream.</s> <s i="20">I was standing out in the back yard with Ahood and Maamood, and everyone was applauding me, even those vultures from the New York Times.</s> <s i="21">Heck, I may not have sounded like Obama, but I was definitely better than McCain.</s> <s i="22">Heh heh.</s> <s i="23">Well, anyways, I realized that something had finally gone right and so I am going to pull up my socks and make that dream a reality.&quot;</s> <s i="24">Bush then gets out of bed and calls Dick and Condi and tells them of his plan.</s> <s i="25">Dick protests and George informs him that the good ol' days are over and its time for him to remember the meaning of &quot;vice&quot;.</s> <s i="26">Condi knows what has to be done and with the full authority of the White House behind her, kindly informs the Israelis, Palestinians and the rest of the region (she even asks the Europeans to join her) that the deal is done, and they would best get on with the plan: a complete end to the Israeli occupation combined with the 
strengthening 
of Israel's security and the launch of a Palestinian state.</s> <s i="27">Bush is Great.</s> <s i="28">Possible?</s> <s i="29">Yes.</s> <s i="30">Probable?</s> <s i="31">No.

Scenario II: The Lame Hawk.</s> <s i="32">Realizing that he has nothing more to lose, Bush decides that those pesky Arabs (he includes Persian Iran in that equation) have hell to pay for not giving him the respect he deserves.</s> <s i="33">He shuts off the political and financial tap to Abbas (even if it is only an IV drip), letting the PA collapse, winks so hard at Israel's Iranian intentions that one eye becomes permanently shut and watches gleefully as Barack Obama gets seriously worried that there is no way he can clean up the mess he is going to inherit.</s> <s i="34">The silver lining for the Palestinians is that they would be unified again if only in misery.</s> <s i="35">Possible?</s> <s i="36">Yes.</s> <s i="37">Probable?</s> <s i="38">You never know what a desperate man will do.</s>
