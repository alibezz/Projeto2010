<s i="0">In general, it is difficult to refer to any armed or violent conflict as &quot;moral&quot; in the sense that usually one party if not both overstep the line of what is considered appropriate behavior.</s> <s i="1">Further, the narrative of a conflict often rests on the definition of what is moral in the eyes of the beholder.</s>

<s i="2">From its inception, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict was no different, with immoral behavior spurring a tragedy that devastated the Palestinian people.</s> <s i="3">Our conflict began when Jewish immigrants arrived in Palestine intending to establish a political entity for the Jewish people on this land--land already home to Palestinians.</s> <s i="4">One of the strategies employed by these immigrants included the forceful taking of land belonging to Palestinian farmers.</s> <s i="5">Then in 1948, 800,000 Palestinians were expelled and fled from their land, becoming refugees.</s> <s i="6">Jewish militias carried out a series of massacres intending to frighten villagers with a dire fate if they remained.</s> <s i="7">Finally, once the land had come under Jewish control, 400 Palestinian villages were entirely demolished to prevent their inhabitants from returning.</s> <s i="8">This erasing of the landscape was not the result of an earthquake or nature taking its course, but the willful act of human beings against an entire community.</s> 

<s i="9">For three decades, Israel tried to deny that this injustice was intentional, until Israeli historians, the &quot;new historians&quot;, documented with the help of records released from Israel's archives that many of these massacres were carried out in order to generate terror and thus cause Palestinians to leave their land for other destinations.</s> <s i="10">Today, we are reaping the seeds planted in Israel's birth.</s> <s i="11">All that has happened since occurred in the context of this historic injustice, which was conducted with the tacit support of the British Mandate government and later, that of the United States.</s> 

<s i="12">Born from this rocky soil, Palestinian engagement has also wavered between the poles of acceptable resistance and immorality, as it were.</s> <s i="13">During the sixties, when the Palestinian people and leadership found themselves dispersed and desperate to remain on the agenda, some attacks targeting civilians (Israelis and westerners) were tried with the intention of attracting the world's attention.</s> <s i="14">This worked in practice but failed in strategy, as such activities only earned the Palestinian people a very negative reputation from which they suffer yet today.</s> <s i="15">In the late eighties, a different tack was tried in the form of the intifada, or uprising, in which Palestinians used boycotts and strikes and peaceful public demonstrations to try to rid themselves of the Israeli occupation and correct the injustice they had experienced.</s> 

<s i="16">Unfortunately, the negotiations that resulted from the intifada still did not bring Palestinians closer to their objective of ending the occupation and a just resolution for the refugee crisis.</s> <s i="17">This failure brought Palestinians to the next phase of the Palestinian struggle that used illegal tactics--during the peace process itself.</s> <s i="18">Here we saw vicious and immoral attacks by both sides against the civilians of the other.</s> <s i="19">In 1990, Israeli soldiers killed 23 unarmed Palestinians that had come to protest a right-wing Israeli demonstration at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque.</s> <s i="20">In another case, 29 Palestinians at prayer in Hebron were killed by right-wing Israeli Baruch Goldstein, whose memory is still revered at a shrine erected in the Hebron settlement of Kiryat Arba.</s> 

<s i="21">But that period was also the beginning of the phenomenon of suicide bombings and the engagement of Islamist groups in their violent struggle with Israel.</s> <s i="22">Although suicide bombings inside Israel have always been condemned by the Palestinian leadership, both because they are seen as &quot;dirty warfare&quot; and because they contradict the leadership's political program, which advocates the two state solution and therefore opposes armed attacks inside the borders of Israel, the two sides seem to be inexorably caught in the grip of uninhibited violence against the other.</s> 

<s i="23">Recently, there have been calls from both sides for an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians to stop targeting civilians.</s> <s i="24">But only during the several weeks of tenure of Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas were Palestinian militants convinced to stop attacks, and subsequently there was a marked drop in attacks on civilians on both sides.</s> <s i="25">Unfortunately, that respite ended with the renewal of Israeli assassinations of Palestinian activists, and with it Palestinian reciprocity.</s> 

<s i="26">Where there is violence, there are bound to be atrocities, and if we have learned anything in our history, it is that violence between Palestinians and Israelis stems from the lack of a political solution that will ensure our future and address the wrongs of the past.</s> <s i="27">The only way to end the suffering of both peoples is through political engagement that has the power to demonstrate to both publics that there is a peaceful means by which Palestinians can end the occupation, which is the source of all their problems, and through which Israelis can achieve the objectives of integration, peace and security.</s>
