<s i="0">In &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, Friedrich Nietzsche's false prophet announced the famous dictum about the &quot;death of God&quot;.</s> <s i="1">Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu yesterday announced the death of hopes for peace and a Palestinian state.</s> <s i="2">No Palestinian refugee right of return.</s> <s i="3">No Jerusalem for the Palestinians.</s> <s i="4">No freeze to settlement building.</s> <s i="5">No sovereign airspace, no real Palestinian sovereignty at all.</s> 

<s i="6">And it gets worse.</s> <s i="7">According to Netanyahu, the Palestinians have no historic roots or rights in Palestine.</s> <s i="8">The Palestinians just happen to be there.</s> <s i="9">For Netanyahu, the West Bank is the biblical land of the Jewish forefathers, going back to Abraham, and belongs to no one else.</s> <s i="10">This is his response to US President Barack Obama's demand to freeze the settlements.</s> <s i="11">All Israeli governments have supported the settlers' colonizing projects.</s> <s i="12">Dividing Jewish colonies in the West Bank into &quot;legal&quot; and &quot;illegal&quot; settlements is intended solely to mislead the world.</s> <s i="13">All of them, with no exception, are illegal under international law.</s>

<s i="14">Why is it that interfaith trialogue stresses Abraham as our common father if Palestinian Christians and Muslims are not recognized as his children on equal footing?</s> <s i="15">Is it because the mother of the Arabs, Hagar, was a slave girl?</s> <s i="16">This is 3,500-year-old thinking.</s> <s i="17">When convenient, Abraham is used as a cushion, a sort of a comfort zone, to avoid the real issues on the ground.</s> <s i="18">The history of Palestine did not begin with Abraham.</s> <s i="19">Even in the Old Testament, when Abraham arrived in the Holy Land, there were Palestinians.</s> <s i="20">When Abraham needed to bury Sara, he did not claim any divine right to own the land; he paid 400 silver shekels to the Palestinians.</s>

<s i="21">Claiming to share US President Barack Obama's vision for peace (Obama welcomed Netanyahu's speech as an important step), Netanyahu called on the Palestinian leadership to return to negotiations &quot;without any preconditions&quot;, a euphemism for rejecting all relevant UN resolutions and previous understandings, including the roadmap.</s> <s i="22">This is a clear setback to the work of the Quartet, as well as to the Arab Peace Initiative.</s> <s i="23">The Palestinian Authority, however, is doing nothing except recycling the &quot;no partner for peace&quot; mantra, throwing it back at Israeli leaders.</s> 

<s i="24">Netanyahu also promoted his notion of economic peace.</s> <s i="25">He wants Arabs not only to recognize Israel as a Jewish state, but also to invest in Israel.</s> <s i="26">He wants full normalization without offering anything in return.</s> <s i="27">He talked about tourism and mentioned Christian religious sites with no mention of Muslim sites.</s> <s i="28">He talked about utilizing solar energy and laying pipelines to Africa and Europe, as if all roads lead to Tel Aviv.</s> <s i="29">There is no mention of an end to the Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights, but he is willing to go to Damascus.</s> <s i="30">This man cannot be serious.</s>

<s i="31">Netanyahu presented an image of a peaceful Israeli society.</s> <s i="32">The root of the problem, he claimed, was Arab rejection of the Jews' right to a national home in their historic land.</s> <s i="33">Of course, nothing is mentioned about the colonial nature of the Zionist project or the misery it caused for the Palestinian people and others for over 60 years.</s> 

<s i="34">All the problems, according to Netanyahu, come from without.</s> <s i="35">This includes his blurb about Iran's nuclear threat.</s> <s i="36">If Netanyahu truly shares the vision of President Obama, then he should talk about a world without nuclear weapons, including getting rid of Israel's nuclear arsenal.</s> <s i="37">This is the opposite of what Netanyahu is demanding; his call for &quot;strong security guarantees&quot; is a euphemism for nuclear power.</s> 

<s i="38">Speaking at the Begin-Sadat Center at Bar Ilan University was a further ironic twist.</s> <s i="39">The deal between Israel and Egypt was based on withdrawing from Egyptian land that was occupied in 1967.</s> <s i="40">The same logic should apply to the Syrian Golan Heights, the Lebanese Sheba Farms, and the Palestinian Gaza Strip and West Bank, including East Jerusalem.</s> <s i="41">Rather than comparing himself to Theodor Herzl, as if he was making a historical speech, Netanyahu should have compared himself to Menachem Begin, who understood the land-for-peace formula.</s>
