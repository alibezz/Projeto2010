<s i="0">Hope springs eternal in the minds of [human beings] but hope must be tempered by reason.</s> <s i="1">Otherwise, frustration and despair will follow. - Pitman Buck, Jr., 1977.</s>

<s i="2">Israel has a new government.</s> <s i="3">What does this mean for the Palestinian question?</s> <s i="4">Will we witness a change in the trend toward finding a lasting solution to the conflict?</s> <s i="5">Does the political turnover in the Israeli leadership represent a turning point, an opportunity that the Palestinians should take seriously in their pursuit of a just and durable solution to their problem?</s>

<s i="6">Since Israel's establishment, the political scene has been dominated by issues of security and war.</s> <s i="7">The major parties were mainly distinguished by different approaches regarding the Israel-Arab conflict, with the Palestinian issue at its heart.</s>

<s i="8">The 2006 elections mark the first time a major party, the Israeli Labor party, has placed economic and social issues at the top of its agenda.</s> <s i="9">This is mainly attributed to Amir Peretz's surprise victory over Shimon Peres in the November 2005 Labor leadership elections; Peretz left the party a few years earlier to form the socialist Am Ehad, which only recently merged into Labor.</s>

<s i="10">The resulting social democratic approach advocated by Labor, which includes promises to raise the minimum wage and allocate a pension for every worker, now stands in sharp contrast to the neo-liberal agenda promoted by Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu.</s> <s i="11">Serving as finance minister from 2003 to 2005, Netanyahu followed a policy that he claimed was responsible for encouraging economic growth and lower taxes--a policy pursued at the expense of Israel's long-running welfare mechanism.This alienated him from many Likud supporters, who traditionally hail from the lower and middle classes.</s> <s i="12">In the campaign, Netanyahu (backed by several economics experts) claimed to have done this to &quot;save the Israeli economy from collapse&quot;.</s> <s i="13">But such claims ignored the serious short-term ramifications for the welfare of the Israeli poor.</s> <s i="14">Despite a very impressive economic growth of 5.2 percent in 2005, the latest report by Israel's National Insurance Institute showed that the number of Israelis living below the poverty line increased last year by 46,000 to 1.58 million, which is 20.5 percent of the country's citizens.</s> <s i="15">Almost half of these people--738,000, to be exact--are children, comprising 34.1 percent of Israelis under 18, compared with 33.2 percent in 2004.</s> <s i="16">Hence, Israel has bypassed the United States and now leads western countries when it comes to child poverty figures.</s>

<s i="17">Israel's growing economic and social gaps undermine universal values of equality and social justice.</s> <s i="18">These gaps are particularly glaring with respect to education: some 60 percent of Israeli 17-year-olds are not eligible for matriculation certificates, most of them coming from low-income neighborhoods and development towns.</s> <s i="19">(Approximately 10 years ago, in an effort to narrow these gaps, education officials established the &quot;Mabar&quot; or &quot;Passage to Matriculation&quot; classes.</s> <s i="20">Extensive resources are invested in these classes, which help selected &quot;weak&quot; students to matriculate.</s> <s i="21">The majority of students in the Mabar classes come from Jewish-Arab roots.</s> <s i="22">In practice, however, the Mabar classes have not led to a significant increase in the number of students that obtain a matriculation certificate.) 

The ultra-orthodox religious party Shas, which has always claimed to champion the poor in Israeli society, joined the Labor party's chorus of attacks on Netanyahu's policies during the campaign, as did a number of small (and often new) socialist parties.</s> <s i="23">Shas is now again in the government.</s>

<s i="24">Further, in a surprising turn of events, the relatively unknown Pensioners' Party, whose platform deals entirely with advancing the rights of the elderly, gained seven seats.</s> <s i="25">This is a protest party.</s> <s i="26">As bizarre as it may seem that an &quot;old folks&quot; party could have some relevance for legions of young people around the country, its message took hold.</s> <s i="27">Tens of thousands of Israelis who couldn't bear to vote for the same people who have made politics abhorrent to them voted for the retirees.</s> <s i="28">Now it sits in the government.</s>

<s i="29">In sum, Kadima's breaking of ties with the very corrupt Likud, emerging as the centrist party with an agenda of &quot;convergence&quot; and planning to define Israel's borders in coalition with a religious party, a social democratic party, and a pensioners' party, shows that the settlement politik is approaching its hour of truth.</s> <s i="30">Resources previously allocated to the settlements are shrinking.</s> <s i="31">More resources must now be redirected to reducing the poverty gap and tackling social issues long ignored because of the overwhelming priority given to security.</s> 

<s i="32">But we should have no illusions.</s> <s i="33">This government will continue the path of suffocating Palestinians' dreams of a viable independent state.</s> <s i="34">We will continue to see the separating wall rising around us, and plans to control the eastern hills running through the Jordan Valley being implemented.</s> <s i="35">Ironically enough, the first decision of the new government was to raise the price of bread by seven percent, and the first decision of Defense Minister Amir Peretz was to bombard neighborhoods in Gaza.</s> <s i="36">We have yet to see how socialist values are compromised by overriding security issues.</s> <s i="37">Notably, the Labor party did not get control of the finance ministry.</s> <s i="38">Minimum wage might rise to $1,000 a year, but the price of bread has already gone up.</s> 

<s i="39">Palestinians, while wrestling with each other, continue to face a fiscal crisis.</s> <s i="40">The Hamas-led government is not able to find ways to pay 160,000 public servants.</s> <s i="41">Israel and the US will continue to use economic pressure, while the people go on suffering.</s> <s i="42">With unemployment in the range of 25 percent, poverty in the range of 45 percent, and both expected to rise in the medium term according to World Bank scenarios for 2006-2008, the future looks very dim.</s> <s i="43">Perhaps we will have to cope with this situation for another two to three months.</s> <s i="44">But in the end, Hamas will have to be realistic, otherwise it will face its downfall--but not in the same manner in which it celebrated its landslide victory!</s>
