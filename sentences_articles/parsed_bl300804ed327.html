<s i="0">United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 (1967) has long been considered a building block for peace in the Middle East.</s> <s i="1">Its importance derives from the fact that it was adopted unanimously by the council, and was accepted by the parties to the conflict.</s> <s i="2">The resolution as such is of a recommendatory character.</s>

<s i="3">The council laid down a few principles to be applied in future negotiations: an Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967 (according to the French text, &quot;retrait des forces armees israeliennes des territoires occupes&quot;), the establishment of secure and recognized boundaries, mutual recognition, freedom of navigation in international waterways in the area, a just settlement of the refugee problem, and the adoption of measures to guarantee the new boundaries.</s>

<s i="4">Unfortunately the parties differ on the interpretation of UNSCR 242 on several points.</s> <s i="5">Two of these differences are discussed below: the question of the scope of the withdrawal, and the refugee issue.</s>

<s i="6">The Arab states and the Palestinians claim that the resolution calls for a complete withdrawal of Israel to the 1967 borders.</s> <s i="7">They base their claim on a line in the preamble that emphasized &quot;the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war&quot;, and on the above quoted French version of the withdrawal clause in paragraph 1.</s>

<s i="8">Israel is of the opinion that a withdrawal is required to secure and recognized boundaries to be established by agreement, and not to the 1967 lines.</s> <s i="9">Israel's claim is based on the following:

First, the English version of the withdrawal clause: if there is a discrepancy with the French version, the English one should be preferred since the proposal was drafted in English and most of the deliberations in the council took place in English.</s>

<s i="10">Second, a proposal to add the word &quot;the&quot;</s> <s i="11">(withdrawal from &quot;the&quot; territories. . . ) was not adopted by the council.</s>

<s i="12">Third, the call for withdrawal has to be interpreted in conjunction with the call for the establishment of &quot;secure and recognized boundaries&quot;.</s> <s i="13">This latter provision would have been meaningless if there had been a call for full withdrawal to the 1967 lines.</s>

<s i="14">And fourth, the provision on the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war reiterates the principle of international law that occupation by itself does not justify annexation.</s>

<s i="15">Turning to the problem of the refugees, while UNSCR 242 merely speaks of a &quot;just settlement&quot; without determining what this solution should be, and without limiting its scope to Palestinian refugees, the Arabs claim that by implication the provision refers to earlier General Assembly resolutions that recommended that the Palestinian refugees be permitted to return to Israel.</s> <s i="16">There is, however, no basis for this interpretation in the text of the resolution.</s>
