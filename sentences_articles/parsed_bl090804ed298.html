<s i="0">It is perhaps an irony that the party in this conflict with, relatively speaking, weak law and order enforcement structure is very much dependent on and hopeful of international law, while the party so proud of its internal legal and judiciary structure consistently undermines and disregards international legality.</s>

<s i="1">Theoretically speaking there should be a strong connection between the strength of internal legal structures and respect for international law, because there should be no contradiction between any law in any specific country and international law.</s> <s i="2">Indeed, if there is a legal ruling in any country that contradicts international law, legally speaking, international law ought to be the dominant.</s>

<s i="3">Israel has always made special efforts to impart the impression, first to Israelis and second to the international community, especially western democracies, that it is a democratic and lawful society and polity.</s> <s i="4">This is one of the ways in which Israel identifies as part of western civilization.</s> <s i="5">The fact that Israel has mostly been in contradiction with specific stipulations of international law and certain United Nations Security Council resolutions probably plays a part in this.</s> 

<s i="6">Israel has been at odds with international law in several ways.</s> <s i="7">Internally, it treats one-fifth of its own citizens, the Palestinians of Israel, with obvious racial discrimination.</s> <s i="8">Israel, in this regard, also publicly presents an attitude in violation of its citizens' rights and international law when it calls for the necessity of preserving the pureness of a specific race inside Israel.</s> 

<s i="9">Israel is also in consistent violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which regulates relations between an occupying power and the people under occupation.</s> <s i="10">Occupied Palestinian land, belonging to individuals or peasants who still carry the deeds, has been confiscated to settle Israel's own civilian population.</s> <s i="11">Recently, the Israel High Court's approval in principle of Israel's separation wall, despite quibbles about details, is in direct opposition to the legal opinion of the International Court of Justice.</s>   

<s i="12">It would be difficult to count all the violations of the Israeli occupation, but they are well documented and usually systematically presented, not only by relevant UN agencies or other international humanitarian agencies, but sometimes even by Israeli groups and organizations that oppose such illegality, e.g. B'Tselem.</s> 

<s i="13">In Palestine, things are completely different.</s> <s i="14">The Palestinian people and leadership have always been keen to base their positions and claims and modify them in accordance with international law.</s> <s i="15">If anybody wants to know what exactly the ultimate objective of the Palestinian people's struggle is, the answer will be a complete adherence to and implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the relevant stipulations of international law.</s> 

<s i="16">And yet, the Palestinian people and their Authority, who succeeded in moving ahead with many reforms, including in the financial and civil service spheres, have unfortunately made little progress in improving their judiciary system and enforcing law and order.</s> 

<s i="17">Part of this can rightly be blamed on the Israeli interruption of the move from limited self-rule in part of the occupied territories into a full fledged independent and sovereign state on all the Palestinian territories, which took place immediately after the collapse of final status negotiations and the return to violent confrontation and reoccupation.</s>
