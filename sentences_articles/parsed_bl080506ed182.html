<s i="0">What, people ask, is the new Israeli government's policy toward the Palestinians.</s> <s i="1">The answer is simple: it has no policy.</s> <s i="2">&quot;Israel&quot;, Henry Kissinger once said, &quot;has no foreign policy; only domestic policy&quot;.</s> <s i="3">That pearl of wisdom was spoken by the American secretary of state during Golda Meir's tenure as prime minister.</s> <s i="4">Compared to what's happening now, Israel apparently did then have a foreign policy--at least in terms of what the world expects of it--one that was far more sophisticated than Ariel Sharon's more than 30 years later.</s> <s i="5">Certainly this is the case with regard to Israel's close neighbor, the Palestinian Authority.</s>

<s i="6">Sharon's disengagement policy from Gaza, and to an even greater extent Ehud Olmert's convergence plan for Judea and Samaria, are, by virtue of their definition as &quot;unilateral&quot;, internal Israeli moves.</s> <s i="7">Despite the dismal failure of the first part of this domestic policy, the uprooting of settlers from Gaza, Sharon's successor Ehud Olmert for some reason still insists on fulfilling the master plan of his predecessor, whose leadership tenure ended so tragically.</s>

<s i="8">In presenting his new government, Olmert declared that as a &quot;lifeline of Zionism&quot;</s> <s i="9">Israel would need a &quot;correct definition of the desired borders for the State of Israel&quot;, i.e., it will have to give up territories in Judea and Samaria.</s> <s i="10">Remaining in areas where most of the Jewish settlements are located, Olmert believes, will require Israel to give the Arabs the right to vote, thereby altering the Jewish nature of the state of Israel.</s> <s i="11">Accordingly, withdrawal will bring about the salvation of the Jewish state.</s> <s i="12">This, then, is the essence of the Olmert government's domestic policy.</s> <s i="13">Despite the fact that this step is a consequence of fear--mainly demographic fear--of the Palestinians, the latter, who will be no less affected by the plan than the Israelis, are not partners and are not involved in its implementation.</s>

<s i="14">The disengagement from Gaza had three principal objectives: reducing the demographic threat, i.e., Olmert's &quot;lifeline of Zionism&quot;; eliminating Israel's responsibility for Gaza; and enhancing the security of the citizens of Israel.</s> <s i="15">There was no need to wait eight months after the disengagement in order to appreciate that the first objective was solely propagandistic: since 1995 (a decade before disengagement) all residents of Gaza have been citizens of the Palestinian Authority.</s> <s i="16">They vote for the Palestinian Legislative Council.</s> <s i="17">Insofar as they do not vote for the Knesset they do not constitute a demographic threat to Israel.</s>

<s i="18">Nor has the second objective, eliminating Israel's responsibility for Gaza, been achieved: in the eyes of the world, Israel's responsibility has not changed, even following the election of a Hamas government.</s> <s i="19">It is Israel and not, say, Egypt, that is held liable for the difficult economic situation in the Strip.</s> <s i="20">Israel is called upon to supply employment, electricity, water, import and export services, telecommunications and health services.</s> <s i="21">And that's just a partial list.</s>

<s i="22">As for the third objective, security, the situation is actually worse: the western Negev region is bombarded daily with qassam rockets; even a katyusha, the ultimate symbol of Israeli fear of the consequences of unilateral withdrawal, was fired at Ashkelon.</s> <s i="23">Hundreds of millions of dollars are currently being allocated for fortifying the western Negev settlements and the Israel-Egypt border.</s> <s i="24">Nor have the &quot;conventional&quot; terrorist attacks, the suicide bombings, stopped.</s>

<s i="25">Now, with Israel's unilateral domestic policy toward the Palestinians continuing despite the negative results of the Gaza experiment, it emerges that not only does Israel not have a real Palestinian policy, but it has learned nothing from its failures.</s> <s i="26">After all, the objective circumstances in Judea and Samaria are no different from those in Gaza.</s> <s i="27">There, too, the vast majority of Palestinians have not, since Oslo, constituted a danger to the Zionist enterprise, i.e., to the Jewish nature of the state of Israel.</s> <s i="28">Some 96 percent of them live in areas A and B, where they recently voted first for a president and more recently for the Palestinian parliament.</s> <s i="29">Disengaging from them will not bring about recognition that Israel has ended its role; in Judea and Samaria, as in Gaza, the world will continue to see Israel as the legally responsible party.</s> <s i="30">And the Israeli security establishment expects the security situation there to worsen, not improve.</s>
