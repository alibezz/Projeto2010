<s i="0">In case we needed a reminder of the devastatingly negative effect the late Yasser Arafat had on the prospects for peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians, Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) is providing it.</s> <s i="1">In scarcely days he has negotiated a ceasefire with Palestinian militants and begun redeploying Palestinian security forces to maintain the quiet.</s> <s i="2">Security coordination with the Sharon government has been reestablished, and the two sides are poised to begin discussing additional confidence-building measures such as prisoner release and Israeli withdrawals from West Bank cities.</s>

<s i="3">Nothing has changed but the Palestinian leadership.</s>

<s i="4">Where do we go from here?</s> <s i="5">The ceasefire--both among the Palestinian forces and between them and the Israel Defense Forces--is still very young and incomplete.</s> <s i="6">Only the passage of time will tell us whether it is genuine, and in particular, whether Abbas' control over his own security forces is sufficient.</s> <s i="7">Beyond the obvious need for patience and good will on the part of both sides, there arises an additional requirement to translate the ceasefire into a new political process.</s> 

<s i="8">Here we return to the roadmap.</s> <s i="9">Both Palestinians and Israelis, as well as the international community represented by the Quartet, continue to address the roadmap as the desired political frame of reference.</s> <s i="10">A comprehensive assessment of the ongoing relevance of the roadmap after years of bitter fighting and far-reaching local and regional strategic developments is beyond the scope of this article.</s> <s i="11">But because we are ostensibly back in phase I of the roadmap, it is vital that we take note now of both parties' obvious limitations.</s>

<s i="12">Abu Mazen has made it absolutely clear that he has no intention of collecting illegal weapons and &quot;dismantling the terrorist infrastructure&quot;, as phase I demands.</s> <s i="13">Rather, he seeks to co-opt the militants into the existing Palestinian political and even police/military infrastructure.</s> <s i="14">From the internal Palestinian standpoint the ceasefire is intended to provide breathing space for cooptation negotiations to take place and to succeed.</s> <s i="15">PM Ariel Sharon for his part has found it impossible to &quot;immediately dismantle settlement outposts erected since March 2001&quot;.</s> <s i="16">Essentially, he wants his intended dismantling of 21 settlements in Gaza and the northern West Bank to be recognized as a viable substitute process.</s> <s i="17">Nor does he intend to reopen PLO institutions in East Jerusalem as phase I requires.</s> <s i="18">Finally the Quartet, which was supposed to monitor the ceasefire, has thus far been caught off guard by developments; conceivably the US will soon begin to fill this role.</s>

<s i="19">So both Israel and the PA are going to have to be flexible with their roadmap phase I demands if this ceasefire is to lead to a political process of some sort.</s> <s i="20">In particular, Israel is going to have to agree to forego the forcible dismantling of the terrorist infrastructure and give Abu Mazen a chance to integrate Hamas and the Fateh dissidents into the Fateh-dominated PA political establishment, as he advocates.</s> <s i="21">Is this a more effective vehicle for facilitating eventual coexistence between Israel and a Palestinian state?</s> The test will be whether this permanently ends Palestinian terrorism, bearing in mind that the total destruction of Hamas has proven a near impossible task for Israel, let alone the PA.
