<s i="0">The rule of law is a core need of every state.</s> <s i="1">When most people living in a state accept the rule of law, they generally live in peace with each other; all except for the criminal fringe, who scorn the law, and upon whom the state seeks to impose criminal law.</s> <s i="2">When a state fails to impose the rule of law on all groups and clans, including independent armed organizations, the state veers toward chaos and pervasive human misery.</s>

<s i="3">Such for example, is the condition in several African states that over the decades since independence failed to develop the rule of law.</s> <s i="4">Such is also the condition of Iraq, liberated from the rule of a cruel despot yet unable to establish a state with the rule of law.</s> 

<s i="5">Such also is the tragic path onto which Yasser Arafat has led the Palestinian people since his return after the Oslo agreements.</s> <s i="6">Instead of seeking to develop a state with the rule of law, a state in which only state organizations carry weapons, he preferred to let existing groups, including armed groups, act as they wish.</s> <s i="7">Moreover he failed to establish an independent judicial system, thus subjecting the courts of justice to the whims of politicians.</s> <s i="8">The result is that externally the Palestinian Authority is fast losing international credibility as an effective partner in the peace process, and internally there is increasing chaos, as different organizations and clans use violence against their opponents.</s> 

<s i="9">What about Israel?</s> <s i="10">When Israel was established Prime Minister David Ben Gurion said the rule of law was vital for the survival of the state.</s> <s i="11">After the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) was created he ordered the dismantling of all other armed organizations, such as the Palmach, Etzel (Irgun) and Lehi.</s> <s i="12">From the start, the judicial system was independent and since the first years of Israel it has made many key decisions that were not necessarily in accord with the government line.</s>

<s i="13">Tragically, the continued occupation of Palestinian territory by Israel has gradually undermined the rule of law as a core Israeli value.</s> <s i="14">Primarily this happens in the occupied territories, where dozens of settlements were established regardless of any law and where groups of settlers use deliberate violence against the Palestinians and against their property.</s> <s i="15">Also the IDF, which is obliged to fight against potential murderers of Jews, often kills, harms and humiliates many innocent Palestinians, including women and children.</s> <s i="16">Inside Israel, the courts of justice still make independent decisions, such as the recent High Court decision obliging the government to draw back parts of the separation fence now being constructed.</s> <s i="17">Nevertheless there is a continued increase in the number of cases where the rule of law is completely ignored, as in the growing number of illegal links between capitalism and government.</s>
