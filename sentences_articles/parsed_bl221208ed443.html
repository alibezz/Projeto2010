<s i="0">In Gaza, everyone is asking what will happen now that the truce has ended.</s> <s i="1">Gazans are deeply concerned about their future after the termination of the Egyptian-brokered ceasefire that saw an almost complete end to fighting between Israeli occupation troops and Palestinian militant groups for six months.</s> 

<s i="2">When the Palestinian factions agreed to the ceasefire in June, the aim was to provide breathing space for Gazans, who, since June 2007, had endured an almost complete Israeli blockade on goods coming into Gaza.</s> <s i="3">As the governing party in Gaza, Hamas entered into the agreement in the hope that it would improve the conditions of Gazan lives and provide itself with a rest in which to consolidate its control.</s> 

<s i="4">But Israel embarrassed Hamas in front of its own people as well as those factions who all along argued that Israel would not be committed to easing the closure on Gaza.</s> <s i="5">The economy in Gaza has almost collapsed.</s> <s i="6">The electricity supply is unreliable, there is a shortage of everything from cooking gas to medicine, while unemployment and poverty have soared.</s> <s i="7">As time went on, more and more people questioned the logic of a truce that had been greeted with great hope.</s> <s i="8">What was it for, only to improve the lives of Israelis in Sderot?</s>

<s i="9">Indeed, people began arguing that Hamas had simply sought to protect itself with the agreement and that the movement cared little for the public interest.</s> <s i="10">This was the kind of criticism that the movement could not long leave unanswered.</s> <s i="11">Two options were open to it: either seek an improved agreement or go back to the option of resistance.</s> 

<s i="12">In addition to these domestic factors, there is an external dimension.</s> <s i="13">Cairo had brokered the last agreement but did not try to mediate a renewal.</s> <s i="14">Irritated by Hamas' refusal to attend reconciliation talks with Fateh in Egypt in November, it seems Cairo has sought to teach Hamas a lesson.</s> <s i="15">Egypt is therefore standing by without intervening to prevent escalation.</s> 

<s i="16">Nevertheless, the dramatic conflagration that some expected has also not happened.</s> <s i="17">The Israeli army has not invaded Gaza and does not appear ready for such a move.</s> <s i="18">Israel is preparing for elections and will not want to enter into any unpredictable military adventure.</s> <s i="19">A major operation will see a massive Palestinian response that would affect Israeli towns near Gaza and would reverberate strongly on the elections.</s> <s i="20">Furthermore, Israel perceives that the militant factions in Gaza are stronger now than they were before and is also wary of endangering Gilad Shalit, the captured Israeli soldier.</s> 

<s i="21">This does not mean that there won't be a new wave of violence.</s> <s i="22">Indeed, it seems almost certain that, at least for a while, the escalation will continue.</s> <s i="23">Both sides will not want to blink first and it will need third party intervention at some point to prevent the escalation from becoming a major conflagration.</s>

<s i="24">Eventually, it is likely that Egypt will try to forge a new agreement.</s> <s i="25">Cairo does not want a huge escalation on its borders and Egypt knows that both Israel and Hamas would prefer to maintain the calm.</s> <s i="26">Any new agreement, however, cannot simply be an extension of the old one.</s> <s i="27">Hamas will need assurances that Gaza's crossings will be open for more than humanitarian goods.</s> <s i="28">Israel will want progress on a prisoner swap for Shalit.</s>
