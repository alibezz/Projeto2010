<s i="0">In their meeting in Texas, President George W. Bush undoubtedly appealed to Ariel Sharon to help him realize his vision for the establishment of a &quot;viable&quot;</s> <s i="1">Palestinian state.</s> <s i="2">By the by, Sharon did not bother to reply that even if Israel withdraws to the 1949 armistice lines (the green line) the Palestinians would not have a viable state; that only if Egypt and Jordan contribute territory to a Palestinian state will it be &quot;viable&quot;.</s>

<s i="3">No, Sharon did not make such a statement.</s> <s i="4">What interests politicians, certainly those of Sharon's ilk, is the next elections or, in Sharon's specific case, the legitimization that he has recently received--now that he has declared that Israel will withdraw and grant the Palestinians a state--from the international media that detested him for more than four decades.</s>

<s i="5">As everyone knows, the population density in the Gaza Strip is among the greatest in the world.</s> <s i="6">The entire Strip comprises no more than 376 square kilometers.</s> <s i="7">I'm told that in Texas, Wyoming, certainly in Australia, there are ranches whose size substantially exceeds that of Gaza.</s> <s i="8">And on this minimal piece of land there dwell today about one and a quarter million people, whose rate of natural growth is the highest in the world, some 4.5 percent per annum.</s> 

<s i="9">In other words, every 17 to 20 years the Gazan population doubles itself.</s> <s i="10">In 2020, for example, the population density in Gaza will reach about 6,650 persons per square kilometer.</s> <s i="11">Barely enough room to stand!</s> <s i="12">The Strip, which is already atrophied, will wallow further in its atrophy, with its principal product being children without a future: without proper education, without a health service worthy even of the third world, without an income and of course without a future.</s> <s i="13">It will be one big jail.</s> <s i="14">Worse, it will be a running sore, a giant blister destined to burst and take with it any agreement that has been reached--if, indeed, one has been reached.</s> 

<s i="15">There is only one way out of the Gaza jail: south, to the empty, unpopulated but fertile land that is waiting to be developed and settled in northern Sinai.</s>

<s i="16">Lest I be misunderstood, I do not mean that we Israelis should, god forbid, transfer the Arabs of Gaza to northern Sinai.</s> <s i="17">Not at all.</s> <s i="18">Rather, when Egypt, in an act of generosity toward its Palestinian brothers and coreligionists, grants them a tiny portion of its land, say, 20,000 square kilometers in northern Sinai, those Palestinians who are being crowded out of Gaza can simply leave and move their homes a short distance away.</s> <s i="19">(Jordan, too, has a role to play in enabling the establishment of a truly viable Palestinian state.</s> <s i="20">Here, for the sake of brevity, we shall concentrate on the Egyptian role.)

In El Arish, for example, a metropolis and a deep water port can be built; not far away, a large airport; and an additional city further to the east, some 20 km. southeast of Rafah.</s> <s i="21">The desert will bloom.</s> <s i="22">A modern highway can be paved along the Sinai border with Israel to Eilat, and link up via a tunnel with Aqaba where it will connect with Jordan's Arava road.</s> <s i="23">Thus will the Arab world be opened to the southern part of the Palestinian state--as well as to the northern part, what is today, de facto, areas A and B.

True, the Egyptians will hardly volunteer to grant their Palestinian brothers land from their large reserves.</s> <s i="24">Egypt comprises more than 1,100,000 square kilometers, of which the 90,000 square kilometers of the Sinai Peninsula are largely unpopulated.</s> <s i="25">Indeed, less than 20 percent of Egypt is inhabited.</s> <s i="26">When such a small percentage of the land is populated, it is not an exaggeration to label the rest, and particularly that on which it is proposed to expand the Palestinian state, &quot;reserves&quot;.</s>

<s i="27">President Bush, who is so committed to a &quot;viable&quot;</s> <s i="28">Palestinian state, a term he refers to in every speech that mentions a Palestinian state, is also obligated to provide it not only with financial means and political support but also with land.</s> <s i="29">Nor can he demand this land from Israel, for the simple reason that even if Israel does not withdraw to the 1949 lines it still won't have enough land for its needs.</s> <s i="30">Already today, with nearly six and a half million souls living on 20,000 square kilometers, Israel is one of the most crowded countries in the world.</s>
