<s i="0">I am a Palestinian from Gaza.</s> <s i="1">I write to you as a Palestinian, a supporter of what you stand for and to share my thoughts with you as you continue your run for the presidency.</s>

<s i="2">There's been a lot of excitement about your candidacy.</s> <s i="3">As you have no doubt surmised from your recent global tour, this excitement extends the world over.</s> <s i="4">The energy and promise of your campaign has resonated with Palestinians too, who yearn for change of their own.</s> 

<s i="5">If you are indeed elected, I plead with you not to fall into the traps that former US presidents have and not to make the same mistakes.</s> <s i="6">Otherwise the promise of peace will be just that--no more than a promise.</s>

<s i="7">Challenge the conventional wisdom of those before you.</s> <s i="8">Oslo has been around for 15 years now.</s> <s i="9">The reality on the ground for Palestinians is at sharp odds with the process itself.</s> <s i="10">During that time, Israel's illegal settlement enterprise has nearly doubled while Palestinian poverty and unemployment rates have reached historic heights.</s> <s i="11">Meanwhile, the prospect of a viable, contiguous Palestinian state is more remote than ever.</s>

<s i="12">Take a hard look at what worked and what didn't and be open and ready to consider alternatives such as power-sharing arrangements or confederations.</s> <s i="13">Increasingly, both sides are realizing it is time to act or consider alternatives that are more sustainable, just and viable for both sides.</s>

<s i="14">Stand in the face of injustice.</s> <s i="15">I ask you to think back to your own anti-apartheid activism.</s> <s i="16">You had been forthright in your criticism of US Middle East policy and called for an even-handed approach to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</s> <s i="17">This was--and still is--the courageous and patriotic thing to do, Mr. Senator.</s> <s i="18">This is change.</s> <s i="19">Real change.</s> 

<s i="20">Be open to meet with a wide range of representatives and leaders and contingents from both sides--something that Oslo failed to ensure.</s> <s i="21">If Israel itself has established contacts and negotiated a ceasefire with Hamas, then so too should the US.</s> <s i="22">This does not mean compromising American principles.</s> <s i="23">Tough talk may be well and good in politics and the race to the White House.</s> <s i="24">But the real test of an effective leader is whether those words accomplish the goals of securing peace and security for the United States and the region.</s> 

<s i="25">Despite all that has happened, Palestinians continue to believe that the US is the only country capable of helping negotiate a just and lasting peace between Palestinians and Israelis.</s> <s i="26">But in order to do so, the US must be a fair and honest broker.</s> <s i="27">And a fair and honest broker cannot turn a blind eye to Israeli aggressions nor be its biggest provider of arms and unrestricted aid dollars.</s> 

<s i="28">According to aid organizations, the situation for 1.5 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip is worse now than it has been since the start of the Israeli military occupation in 1967.</s> <s i="29">The people of Gaza are suffocating.</s> <s i="30">But there is no natural disaster to speak of here, no civil war or genocide.</s> <s i="31">This catastrophe is completely man-made, and fortunately it is reversible.</s> <s i="32">The people of Gaza have been subject to a determined effort to choke an entire population into submission.</s> <s i="33">And history will judge us on how we react.</s>

<s i="34">More than 80 percent of Gazans now rely on humanitarian aid and more than half live under the poverty line and are unemployed as a direct result of the Israeli blockade.</s> <s i="35">Movement in and out of Gaza is all but impossible and supplies of food and water, sewage treatment and basic healthcare can no longer be taken for granted.</s> <s i="36">The blockade has effectively dismantled the economy and impoverished the population of Gaza.</s> 

<s i="37">But let us not make the mistake of reducing this to mere economics, Mr. Senator.</s> <s i="38">Israel's policy affects the civilian population of Gaza indiscriminately and constitutes a collective punishment against ordinary men, women and children.</s> <s i="39">The measures taken are illegal under international humanitarian law as well as US law.</s>

<s i="40">Palestinians have national aspirations as they do social and economic ones.</s> <s i="41">We yearn for our freedom, Mr. Senator, the freedom to move and think and breathe without outside control; the freedom to live and be united with our loved ones.</s> 

<s i="42">Mr. Senator, though my husband is also Palestinian, he is not allowed to visit--let alone live in--Gaza.</s> <s i="43">We cannot exercise our natural right to live together in our own land and as a family.</s> <s i="44">This is because Israel, despite its much-lauded disengagement from that territory, maintains its occupation and control of the area.</s>

<s i="45">On your recent trip to Berlin, you applauded the felling of the wall there and talked about the need to tear down walls &quot;between races and tribes; Christian and Muslim and Jew&quot;.</s> <s i="46">The speech was inspirational.</s> <s i="47">It would have been more impressive if you had called for the abolition of Israel's wall--three times the length and twice as high as the Berlin wall--during your trip to Jerusalem.</s> 

<s i="48">The Quartet put forward a list of three conditions to end the blockade of Gaza: that violence ends, that peace agreements are abided by and that Israel is recognized where Palestine has yet to be recognized.</s> <s i="49">It is as though the onus of Israel's security lay with the Palestinians.</s> <s i="50">The statistics paint a very different picture of the reality on the ground.</s> 

<s i="51">Last year, 520 Palestinians were killed, including 70 children.</s> <s i="52">Twenty-four Israelis were killed during the same period.</s> <s i="53">Since the Annapolis conference, the number of Israeli military checkpoints increased by about 60, and the rate of Israeli settlement expansion has exploded.</s> 

<s i="54">These trends are destroying the possibilities of peace in the Middle East and they are undermining America's national interests as well as Israel's own security.</s>

<s i="55">The overwhelming majority of Palestinians did not leave their districts last year due to Israeli control over their movement.</s> <s i="56">The average illegal Israeli settler is allowed to use almost 50 times more water than a Palestinian residing legally in his own land.</s>
