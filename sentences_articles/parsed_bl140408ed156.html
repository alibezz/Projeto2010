<s i="0">It is in Israel's vested interest to seek a political settlement with Syria--and not only in order to neutralize the Iranian-backed Hizballah menace.</s> <s i="1">An Israeli-Syrian peace, which is relatively easy to achieve, can help settle the more intricate and critical Israeli-Palestinian dispute insofar as Syria can induce Hamas to create, with the PLO, a national unity government and endorse a Palestinian-Israeli agreement.</s> <s i="2">Within the framework of such a deal, Syria should also agree to absorb the 350,000 Palestinian refugees who reside there as well as help resolve the more acute problem of the 300,000 or so Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.</s>

<s i="3">It is true that Syrian President Bashar Assad has not indicated so far that he is willing to curb Hizballah, moderate Hamas or absorb many Palestinian refugees in return for peace with Israel.</s> <s i="4">On the contrary, he has depicted both Hizballah and Hamas as &quot;national liberation movements&quot; and has supported their military buildup vis-a-vis Israel.</s> <s i="5">He has also facilitated the shipment of long-range rockets from Iran to Hizballah while increasing his own arsenal of long-range missiles and solidifying his strategic alliance with Iran.</s> <s i="6">Furthermore, the ability of Hizballah to inflict great destruction and many casualties in northern Israel during the war of July-August 2006, and of Hamas to harass southern Israel in recent months, may have encouraged Damascus to advance its military option versus Israel.</s> <s i="7">Simultaneously, Syria also helps Hamas to foil any Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement that could isolate Damascus and bar it from retrieving the Golan within the framework of a political settlement with Israel.</s>  

<s i="8">Consequently, while slow progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations plays into its hands, Syria is becoming further integrated into the &quot;axis of evil&quot; alongside Iran, Hizballah, Islamic Jihad and increasingly also Hamas.</s>

<s i="9">Conversely, however, it is likely that Damascus' membership in this alliance has been aimed not only to counterbalance Israel's strategic advantage (and the potential American threat from Iraq) but also as a bargaining chip in its negotiations with Israel (and the US) for an advantageous political settlement.</s> <s i="10">Thus, Assad may change his relations with Hizballah and Hamas and possibly also with Iran provided he retrieves the Golan Heights from Israel, maintains his strategic influence in Lebanon, gets off the Hariri assassination case, obtains financial help from the West and the Arab Gulf states in order to improve Syria's ailing economy and assures the survival of his own regime as well.</s>

<s i="11">As it happened, since his ascendancy to power in July 2000 Bashar Assad has periodically and publicly suggested renewing peace talks with Israel &quot;without preconditions&quot;, while indicating that Syria demands the return of the Golan within the framework of a peace agreement with Israel.</s> <s i="12">Occasionally, however, Assad has made crude anti-Israel and anti-Jewish remarks and threatened to liberate the Golan by military force.</s> <s i="13">In the same vein Damascus was presumably building a nuclear plant with North Korean help (that was destroyed by Israel in September 2007) while participating a few months ago in the Annapolis peace conference that aimed at resolving the Arab-Israel conflict and notably the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.</s>

<s i="14">Thus, although Damascus has been preparing a strong military deterrent--mostly by long-range missiles--it does not appear to have a military option vis-a-vis Israel.</s> <s i="15">It still prefers the political option, namely a (cold) peace agreement with Israel, as well as mending fences with the US and the Sunni Arab states, without relinquishing its national interests.</s> 

<s i="16">The Sunni Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia and Egypt, although at odds with Syria, wish to extricate it from the &quot;Shi'ite crescent&quot; with Iran and Hizballah and enlist its help to settle the Lebanese crisis and the Palestinian-Israeli problem.</s> <s i="17">They would probably be ready to reward Syria for its services.</s> <s i="18">By contrast, the United States under the leadership of President George W. Bush is still reluctant to engage Syria unless it submits to tough American pre-conditions: ceasing to support Hizballah, Hamas and Iraqi insurgents as well as ending its meddling in Lebanese politics.</s> <s i="19">Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has held similar positions and in late September 2006 even stated that &quot;as long as I serve as prime minister, the Golan Heights will remain in our hands, because it is an integral part of the state of Israel.&quot;</s> <s i="20">Notably, though, other Israeli political and military leaders have advocated sounding out Assad's peace overtures.</s>
