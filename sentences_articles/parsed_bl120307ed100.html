<s i="0">The Israeli security fence project has, in the course of some five years of construction and operation, provided a rather incredible vehicle for Palestinians and other opponents of Israel to malign it.</s> <s i="1">The way Israel has been pilloried over the fence offers a unique and telling study of the facility with which our Palestinian neighbors (and many others who simply don't know better) grasp and manipulate symbols of the conflict in order to gain a propaganda advantage, excuse their own excesses and failings and satisfy their need for Israel-bashing.</s>

<s i="2">Bearing in mind that only eight percent of the currently existing barrier (and but four percent when the entire barrier is completed in a year or so) are constructed in the form of a movable concrete wall and the remaining 92 percent is metal fencing, it is quite an achievement for Palestinian public diplomacy to have labeled the barrier internationally &quot;the wall&quot;.</s> <s i="3">Walls, as in the Berlin Wall, have more negative connotations than fences (remember &quot;good fences make good neighbors&quot;?).</s> 

<s i="4">The International Court of Justice at The Hague, mandated to discuss the fence's legality by the UN General Assembly, called it a wall, which makes one wonder just how objective those judges could possibly be.</s> <s i="5">Jimmy Carter, in his recent book accusing Israel of apartheid, labels the fence &quot;the Great Wall&quot;, thereby establishing a parallel between a wire mesh barrier that can barely be distinguished from a distance of a few hundred meters and a structure visible from satellites orbiting the earth.</s> <s i="6">It was only a matter of time until Holocaust comparisons were introduced: a few days ago, two members of a delegation of German Catholic bishops compared the West Bank as separated by the fence to the Warsaw ghetto.</s> 

<s i="7">The fence currently attaches less than 10 percent of the West Bank to Israel.</s> <s i="8">This figure is not far from that more or less agreed in talks between President Clinton, PM Ehud Barak and Chairman Yasser Arafat as the amount of West Bank land Israel would annex in a final status agreement within the framework of &quot;land swaps&quot;.</s> <s i="9">Moreover, the fence is temporary in structure: in accordance with Israel High Court decisions it has already been moved countless times.</s> <s i="10">Yet Israel is constantly accused of abusing the fence to cantonize the West Bank and prevent the emergence of a Palestinian state.</s>

<s i="11">Undoubtedly, Israeli mistakes have made it easier to demonize Israel by means of the fence project.</s> <s i="12">Initially the fence was placed deep in Palestinian territory in several areas, thereby lending credence to the claim that it was being abused for a land-grab (it was later moved closer to the green line).</s> <s i="13">And Israel foolishly never bothered to show up at the ICJ deliberations in The Hague in order to counter deceptive Palestinian claims.</s> 

<s i="14">These mistakes have at times distorted the real and vital need for the fence.</s> <s i="15">It was built to stop the Palestinian suicide bombing campaign that had begun to generate real panic in Israel in 2002.</s> <s i="16">Coupled with additional military measures inside the West Bank, it has worked to a surprising extent, considering that only a little more than half of it has thus far been constructed and operationalized: no suicide bombers have ever successfully crossed the Gaza or West Bank fences.</s> <s i="17">Here it is important to note that, while virtually all Palestinians condemn the fence, around 50 percent of Palestinians still support suicide bombings.</s> <s i="18">In this regard, what I wrote in these virtual pages three and four years ago remains just as true today: if there were no suicide bombers there would be no fence.</s> <s i="19">Since that is not the case, we have to protect ourselves and we are doing it the right way.</s>

<s i="20">Except in one region.</s> <s i="21">If Palestinians were to concentrate their criticism of the fence on the Jerusalem area, they would find in me an ally.</s> <s i="22">Everywhere else, the fence not only stops suicide bombers but, broadly speaking, separates Palestinians from Israelis, thereby keeping alive the option of a two-state solution based on the existence of a Jewish state alongside an Arab state.</s> <s i="23">In Jerusalem, sadly, these rationales do not appear to apply.</s> <s i="24">In Jerusalem, misguided ideology trumps genuine security logic, and in the name of &quot;united Jerusalem, eternal capital of Israel&quot; some 250,000 Palestinians are being forcibly attached to Israel and separated from Palestine.</s>
