<s i="0">The conflict(s) in the Middle East cannot be reduced to the most recent Israeli asymmetrical and &quot;disproportionate&quot; war on Lebanon (which is being described in Arab media as the Sixth War).</s> <s i="1">It is also naive to believe that this war was launched because of the two Israeli soldiers captured by Hizballah.</s> <s i="2">The conflict goes deeper and the recent crisis is only a symptom of it.</s> <s i="3">One should not lose sight of the original cause of all that is going on today: the Israeli occupation of Arab lands.</s>

<s i="4">It has become a cliche that no military action can solve the Middle East conflict.</s> <s i="5">Yet, it seems that one war is only a prelude to another.</s> <s i="6">This means that during and in between these wars, diplomacy fails to address the root problems.</s>

<s i="7">For the Palestinians, there is a strong feeling of deja vu all over again.</s> <s i="8">The destruction of infrastructure that Israel is inflicting on Lebanon today, it has done and is still doing in the occupied Palestinian territories, mostly in the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="9">Israel has hit the airport in Gaza, destroyed electric power plants, bombarded bridges and private homes, killed families and children, created a no-man's zone in the north of the Strip, etc., etc., etc.
 
While Israel continues to bombard Lebanon, people around the world, including Arabs and Muslims, are bombarded with heartbreaking images such as those coming from the second massacre at Qana.</s> <s i="10">There is sadness, sorrow and anger.</s> <s i="11">These images continue to shape the collective memory of those who surround Israel.</s> <s i="12">It is a guaranteed recipe for continued conflict.</s>

<s i="13">The same could be said about the United Nations Security Council.</s> <s i="14">Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, has realized that people around the world are aware of the players and mechanisms that prevent a ceasefire in Lebanon.</s> <s i="15">He wasted no time in stating that the future of the UN was at stake.</s> <s i="16">Every resolution has to be approved by the United States; any attempt to bypass the US will be met by a veto.</s> <s i="17">Of course, Israel has not complied with a host of previous resolutions that were not to its liking.</s> <s i="18">Allowing Israel such a free hand and not holding it accountable to international law only means that the conflicts will not be solved.</s>

<s i="19">Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is interested in creating an image of a war that he will win to employ this &quot;victory&quot; for his unilateral &quot;convergence&quot; plan.</s> <s i="20">Again, this plan does not solve the conflict since it ignores the roots of the problem: the occupation.</s> 

<s i="21">All of these facts and scenarios should signal trouble for any Palestinian government.</s> <s i="22">The current Palestinian government, formed by Hamas, has been isolated by Israel and western countries.</s> <s i="23">Though it came to power through a transparent democratic process, it was not internationally accepted.</s> <s i="24">It had to fulfill Israeli and western conditions, including the recognition of Israel.</s>

<s i="25">The situation on the ground in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is very grim.</s> <s i="26">Over 65 Palestinian ministers and members of the Palestinian Legislative Council are prisoners in Israeli jails.</s> <s i="27">The government functions under very difficult circumstances; it has not been able to pay the salaries of civil servants for the past five months.</s> <s i="28">Israel continues to withhold taxes it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority.</s> <s i="29">The end result is that there is a cash crunch and ministries do not have proper running budgets.</s> 

<s i="30">It should be noted that previous Palestinian governments that included prime ministers Ahmed Qurei and Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), who did recognize Israel and were pillars of the Oslo Accords, did not stand a much better chance.</s> <s i="31">And since Abu Mazen became PA president, he has been deemed irrelevant and subsequently weakened by Israel.</s> 

<s i="32">As a possible way out, leaders of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails agreed on a document that paved the way for a potential Palestinian unity government.</s> <s i="33">Ismail Haniyeh, the current prime minister, is on record as saying that Hamas would still form this new government because it has the largest number of seats in the PLC. But even if all parties agreed to a government formed of technocrats, it would not bring the conflict to an end.</s> <s i="34">Israel continues with its unilateral steps that in practice confine Palestinians to living in Bantustans, large jails circumscribed by a huge network of Israeli colonies, military checkpoints and walls.</s>

<s i="35">An end to corruption in the PA and a unity government might be helpful steps, yet no solution will loom on the horizon until Israel is either willing or pressured to implement relevant UN resolutions to end the occupation.</s> <s i="36">But there is no apparent change of heart in Israel, nor does the international community, especially the United States, appear willing to put any pressure on Israel to comply with international law any time soon.</s>
