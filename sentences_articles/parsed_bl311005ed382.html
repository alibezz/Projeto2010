<s i="0">James Wolfensohn, former president of the World Bank and a respected statesman and businessman, took upon himself a near impossible mission when he special economic emissary of the Quartet.</s> <s i="1">His mission was to generate an economic dimension to the government of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan and to stabilize, with the help of economic components, the new political reality in Gaza in its post-occupation independent status.</s>

<s i="2">The strategy was clear: an improved economic situation in Gaza would, on the one hand, bring about stabilization of the political-security situation there, and on the other, serve as a positive example and incentive for all parties to take additional steps.</s>

<s i="3">The Wolfensohn plan comprised a number of components that appeared to be both simple and vital for the economic advancement of Gaza: 1) creating links between Gaza and Israel, Egypt and the West Bank; 2) generating immediate employment by maintaining the hothouses and operating the Erez industrial zone; 3) producing a commitment on the part of the international community to provide broad financial support in order to create an economic infrastructure and sources of employment not only in Gaza but in the West Bank as well; and 4) encouraging the Palestinian Authority to manage its economic, civil and security policies with efficiency and transparency.</s> 

<s i="4">The plan thus presumed close links with Israel, considerable international aid, and the existence of a rational PA. The following assessment of the plan is preliminary, and addresses a period of less than two months following disengagement.</s> <s i="5">It might have been advisable to wait a bit longer, but in the present reality it could be beneficial to offer a few insights in the hope of enhancing the plan's chances of success.</s>

<s i="6">First, we address the links between the Gaza Strip and the outside world.</s> <s i="7">The reality of the first two months has been particularly hard, with Gaza partially closed and passages to Israel, Egypt and the West Bank not providing the minimum input needed for stabilizing the economy.</s>

<s i="8">The link to Egypt has not been regularized.</s> <s i="9">Israel's hasty departure from the philadelphi road, without agreed and binding arrangements for the passage of goods and people, generated confusion and unhappiness in all quarters.</s> <s i="10">Israel feels its interests have been damaged by Egyptian and Palestinian failure to supervise the passage of goods and ordnance.</s> <s i="11">If this situation continues, Israel will be pushed to break the customs envelope and create separate customs regimes for Gaza and the West Bank, with all that this entails both politically and economically.</s> <s i="12">Nor are the links to Israel working; the Erez and Karni passages are partially closed, reflecting the unstable security reality.</s> <s i="13">As for the link to the West Bank, here too the security situation and acts of violence are preventing realization of Wolfensohn's proposal regarding the escorting of regular convoys between Gaza and the West Bank.</s>

<s i="14">The closure of Gaza means the removal of a foundation stone from the economic plan.</s> <s i="15">In practice this prevents not only future economic growth, but even the minimal standard of living that prevailed in Gaza prior to disengagement.</s> <s i="16">Accordingly, the primary mission is undoubtedly to create conditions for opening the Gaza Strip to the passage of goods from all sides.</s>

<s i="17">Turning to the need to create immediate sources of employment, Wolfensohn's initiative to purchase the hothouses and turn them over to a Palestinian company was unique and praiseworthy.</s> <s i="18">About 80 percent of the hothouses were transferred to the Palestinians, facilitating the creation or preservation of some 3,000 jobs in agriculture.</s> <s i="19">But the fly in the ointment is that the lack of clarity in the Gaza-Israel link is liable to sabotage any chance of exporting the hothouses' agricultural produce, while at the same time preventing supply of production inputs such as fertilizers.</s> <s i="20">Thus, despite the welcome initiative and the private financial generosity (including by Wolfensohn himself) involved here, the considerable effort invested will be for naught unless the proper transportation links, internal and external, are arranged.</s> <s i="21">Meanwhile, the initiative to reopen the Erez industrial zone is proceeding at a snail's pace.</s>

<s i="22">Third, the unstable security situation and uncertainty regarding internal governance are discouraging international initiatives to invest in the economic projects considered vital in order to create jobs for a population that maintains the highest birthrate in the world and has a current unemployment rate of some 40 percent.</s> <s i="23">Nor are the public projects involving infrastructure and welfare making progress.</s> <s i="24">The flagship project--constructing a port in Gaza--is delayed.</s> <s i="25">The infrastructure projects require links at this stage with Israel (the Ashdod port) or the West Bank (the Bethlehem stone quarries).</s> <s i="26">The danger in delaying projects assigned to the international community is that its attention will be diverted to other regions that have urgent needs.</s>

<s i="27">Finally, Israel's departure from Gaza in favor of an independent Palestinian regime has not, thus far, produced a stable and efficient government that can exercise authority and generate the necessary conditions for moving the economy forward and creating confidence, both internal and external.</s> <s i="28">The test for Palestinians is clear: maintaining governmental responsibility with all that this entails.</s> <s i="29">This means leadership.</s>

<s i="30">Wolfensohn brought to our region good will, a proven track record from public and private endeavors, and exceptional international connections.</s> <s i="31">He received the backing of all actors in the region and beyond, and formulated a precise plan for dealing with the challenges.</s> <s i="32">He now finds himself, along with his sponsors, the Quartet, as but one more in a long chain of figures over recent decades who have fallen victim to the syndrome of an extended and complex Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</s>
