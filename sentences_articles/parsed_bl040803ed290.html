<s i="0">The issue of incitement is coming again to the forefront in the midst of the finger pointing over who is abiding by the requirements of the peace process, and who is simply doing what is required to get by.</s> <s i="1">In reality, much of this discussion falls into the category of propaganda and efforts to wrack up points, rather than an attempt to understand how incitement might be reversed from encouraging aggression to inspiring understanding.</s> <s i="2">Media and education are used to fulfill both of these very different goals.</s> 

<s i="3">In the history of &quot;incitement&quot;, Palestinians used media and other educational tools to prepare the public (especially new generations) and perpetuate an enthusiasm for the national duty of defending the Palestinian land and people, both of which have been under attack by a foreign occupying army.</s> <s i="4">Palestinians saw that &quot;project&quot; in a positive light as a way of defining Palestinian nationhood.</s> <s i="5">Certainly, the Israeli side has done the same, in trying to recruit its nation in the fight with the opposing side.</s> 

<s i="6">But with the start of the peace process, in particular the Oslo agreement that marked the first codified peace between Palestinians and Israelis, both parties agreed that it was now time to move from the culture of incitement to the culture of peace.</s> <s i="7">That required educating both peoples in the values of tolerance and reconciliation in order to gradually reduce the levels of hostility and hatred and revenge.</s> <s i="8">On the Palestinian side, a great deal of progress was made in this regard, to the extent that the next Palestinian generation--those in their late teens before the Aqsa intifada--had grown up in an environment nearly free of the accumulation of hatred and hostility.</s> <s i="9">We were truly on our way to a generation that was prepared to accept coexistence with Israel under the terms of reference specified in the Oslo accords and assuming the need to end the occupation.</s> <s i="10">There were, of course, exceptions because there were those who continued to oppose the peace process and did not stop their attacks much less their message of hostility, but these people made up a small minority.</s> <s i="11">As the peace process progressed and took hold, they became even more marginalized.</s> 

<s i="12">An example of this sea change in the Palestinian environment can be seen through the lens of the Palestinian school curriculum, which was introduced in Palestinian schools several years after the Oslo accords, after much research and discussion.</s> <s i="13">The curriculum replaced Jordanian texts in the West Bank and Egyptian texts in the Gaza Strip, both of which had been administered by the Israeli military.</s> <s i="14">The Palestinian curriculum, while yet to cover all grades, is completely absent of incitement or jingoistic language.</s> <s i="15">Except for some rare cases, it refers to the Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and not to those in Israel.</s> <s i="16">It also does not refer to Israel or the Jewish people in a hostile or inciting way.</s>

<s i="17">There are some sections in the history texts that offer an account of what Palestinians and many Israelis consider historical fact: the settling of historic Palestine by the Zionist movement and the subsequent forced removal of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes, land and properties and the creation of the refugee tragedy.</s> <s i="18">The texts also remember as heroes those Palestinian forefathers who fought bravely to defend Palestinian land.</s> 

<s i="19">All too frequently one hears that the Palestinian curriculum contains no map of Israel or demarcation of Israel's borders.</s> <s i="20">That is correct.</s> <s i="21">The most important of the reasons for this is that Israel has not yet recognized the Palestinian state and its borders in kind.</s> <s i="22">Palestinians view their recognition of Israel as part and parcel of the recognition of two states.</s> <s i="23">I think that Palestinians will be prepared to include a map of Israel in their official textbooks and their national consciousness at that time that Israel is willing to allow, and officially recognizes, a Palestinian state in its own Israeli national narrative.</s> <s i="24">Even today, when one visits the offices of some high-ranking Israeli politicians, it is the map of historic Palestine that hangs on the wall--maps that include no demarcation of the green line and the occupied West Bank and Gaza.</s>

<s i="25">When the peace process collapsed into the intifada in 2000, as Israel reoccupied Palestinian Authority-controlled areas, and while Palestinian society reeled with nearly 3,000 dead and tens of thousands of arrests, Palestinians renewed a national narrative that encouraged the new generation to stand fast against aggression and defend themselves, the people and the land.</s> <s i="26">There is no doubt that Palestinians can easily turn again to the language of reconciliation and cultural understanding--when there is a concrete prospect of peace.</s>
