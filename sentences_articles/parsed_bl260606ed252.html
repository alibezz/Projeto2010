<s i="0">Nearly a year has passed since the Israeli settlements were removed and the Israel Defense Forces withdrew from the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="1">Israel has returned to the pre-Six-Day War armistice line.</s>

<s i="2">The principal reason for PM Ariel Sharon to carry out the disengagement was the pointlessness of 8,000 Jews living among 1.3 million crowded Palestinians whose rate of annual natural growth is five times the number of the settlers.</s> <s i="3">But Sharon was also prompted in his decision by another factor: after five years of violent confrontation and considerable operational success, it was clear that Israel could not eradicate Palestinian violence in the Strip.</s>

<s i="4">Israel hoped that, once the disengagement was completed, two things would happen: on the one hand, the Palestinians would have no cause to continue carrying out terrorist acts once the rationale of removing the occupation was gone; on the other, the urgent need to organize the lives of the local Palestinian population would alter domestic Palestinian priorities.</s>

<s i="5">Neither of these things happened.</s> <s i="6">In Palestinian eyes, the evacuation from the Strip was an unequivocal victory for armed struggle, and what &quot;succeeded&quot; in Gaza in their view would produce a similar success in the West Bank, Jerusalem and--why not--in Beersheba, Tel Aviv and Haifa.</s> <s i="7">In parallel, a series of domestic Palestinian problems, together with the Hamas election victory and the absence of effective central government, diverted nearly all Palestinian efforts toward more violent struggle, with the needs of the local population completely neglected.</s>

<s i="8">In the absence of IDF forces, and with the Sinai border virtually wide open, the Gaza Strip has become a giant depot for the development, manufacture and import of ordnance that fuels an unending attack on Sderot and the other Israeli settlements around the Strip.</s> <s i="9">Not only did Israel's departure not bring an end to the shooting, but today Palestinian fire is directed, without exception, at towns and villages within the green line, where there is no controversy regarding Israel's sovereignty.</s>

<s i="10">The Palestinian objective is to attack and kill any Jew, indiscriminately, within Israel.</s> <s i="11">Palestinian terrorists prefer to attack innocent civilians, particularly in crowded population centers.</s> <s i="12">Israel for its part cannot acquiesce in the firing of Qassam rockets at civilian settlements.</s> <s i="13">The IDF has no technological solution for intercepting the rockets before they reach their target.</s> <s i="14">This leaves it no alternative but to pinpoint and strike at the terrorists, their organizers and commanders, while taking care not to hurt innocent civilians--an intent that unfortunately cannot be fully realized without mishaps, particularly in the crowded Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="15">Alternatively, the IDF can bombard areas in the northern Strip where the Qassam rocket launchers are deployed.</s>

<s i="16">Thus do the actions of both sides reflect a sad characteristic of the violent asymmetrical struggle between Israel and the Palestinians.</s> <s i="17">The terrorist organizations don't care whether, where and how many innocent Israelis they hit; on the contrary, this is their objective.</s> <s i="18">They have never lost any sleep over the massive murder of Israeli boys and girls who just wanted to have fun in a Tel Aviv beach disco or the dead and wounded among hundreds of guests who came to celebrate Pesach at a hotel in Netanya.</s> 

<s i="19">This is not the case with Israel and the IDF: if and when Israeli fire hits an innocent Palestinian, Israel is called upon to prove and, what is even more difficult, to convince the world that the victim indeed chanced to be positioned next to terrorists who were defined as legitimate targets by any standard, and that under these tactical circumstances of a counter-terrorist operation casualties among the innocent were unavoidable.</s> <s i="20">Still, the expressions of regret by IDF authorities and the government of Israel are not accepted at face value; the Palestinians present them as a cynical gesture--crocodile tears.</s>

<s i="21">The Palestinian establishment hastens to exploit every child or adult victim of Israeli retaliation in Gaza for an effective propaganda campaign aimed at blaming Israel.</s> <s i="22">With great ado, it condemns IDF actions and demands a total cessation of Israeli fire and targeted assassinations, while completely, and not accidentally, ignoring the Qassam rockets fired at Israeli communities that IDF fire sought to prevent or at least reduce in effectiveness.</s> <s i="23">Moreover, this portrayal of injured Palestinian civilians is accompanied by a total disregard for the real targets of these IDF operations (who are usually killed or injured): terrorists actively involved in firing Qassams.</s>

<s i="24">There is yet another asymmetrical aspect.</s> <s i="25">The Palestinian terrorists well understand the strategic significance of their rocket barrages.</s> <s i="26">If Israel fails to stop the rockets--and this it can only do through dialogue and a genuine agreement with the Palestinians or, sadly, by using force on a far higher level than that invoked until now--and if the threat to the residents of Sderot prevails, then inevitably Sderot will become a ghost town.</s>
