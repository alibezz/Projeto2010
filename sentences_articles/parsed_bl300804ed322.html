<s i="0">It is one of the more telling ironies of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that an alleged central building block for its solution was never intended for that purpose and is largely irrelevant and even counterproductive to any genuine attempt to end the conflict.</s> <s i="1">United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, approved unanimously on November 22, 1967 in the aftermath of the Six-Day War, was an attempt to provide guidelines for peace between Israel and its state neighbors: Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.</s> <s i="2">As such, it has had 50 percent success thus far, and its principles remain relevant to future negotiations between Israel and Syria and Lebanon, because it addresses their bilateral issues and grievances: borders, territory, security, and recognition.</s>

<s i="3">But UNSCR 242 does not address the most burning issues that divide Israelis and Palestinians.</s> <s i="4">It never mentions Jerusalem or holy places.</s> <s i="5">It calls for &quot;a just settlement of the refugee problem&quot; without mentioning which refugees (Arab?</s> <s i="6">Jewish?) or providing even a hint of a formula for resolving the relevant refugee issues.</s> <s i="7">It repeatedly refers to &quot;every State in the area&quot; in the context of peace and security, thereby further emphasizing its inapplicability to non-state actors like the Palestinians, whom it never even mentions.</s> <s i="8">Thus when it &quot;affirms the necessity&quot; for &quot;guaranteeing the territorial inviolability and political independence of every State in the area, through measures including the establishment of demilitarized zones&quot;, UNSCR 242 provides a useful tool to Syria and Israel, if and when they get back to the negotiating table, in order to separate their armies.</s> <s i="9">But it clearly does not refer to Palestine, which was not a state in 1967, did not fight in that war, and does not have an army.</s> <s i="10">And finally, UNSCR 242 requests the secretary-general to designate a special representative to promote Middle East agreement; that emissary, Gunnar Jarring, never chose to negotiate with Palestinians.</s>

<s i="11">The PLO accepted UNSCR 242 only in 1988, in response to a set of American conditions that culminated in Yasser Arafat's renunciation of terrorism (one of several) and led to a US-PLO dialogue.</s> <s i="12">Accepting UNSCR 242 was considered a kind of entry ticket to the Middle East peace process.</s> <s i="13">Ever since, it has been included, knee-jerk fashion, in the preamble to all formulae for Israeli-Palestinian peace--Oslo, Geneva, the roadmap, etc--always along with UNSC Resolution 338, which was passed after the 1973 War and which says absolutely nothing relevant to the Israel-Palestine conflict beyond calling on the sides to implement UNSCR 242.</s>  <s i="14">In the best case, when real negotiations do take place, UNSCR 242 is set aside in favor of a substantive discussion of the real issues.</s> <s i="15">In the worst case the two sides get hung up on arguments about how much West Bank and Gazan territory UNSCR 242 demands that Israel withdraw from (territories or &quot;the&quot; territories).</s>

<s i="16">In 2002, the Security Council passed Resolution 1397, for the first time (since General Assembly Resolution 181 in 1947) calling for a two state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.</s> <s i="17">That was a step in the right direction, and UNSCR 1397 is rightfully mentioned since then as a building block for peace.</s> <s i="18">Would it, then, be fair to say that the repeated, robot-like mention of 242/338 in the Israeli-Palestinian case is detrimental to the chances of a settlement?</s> <s i="19">Or is this simply the harmless, ritual dead wood that any prolonged and complex international political process carries with it?</s>

<s i="20">Better to leave UNSCR 242 for the history books, and for Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese peace talks.</s> <s i="21">The Israeli-Palestinian issue badly needs a better set of internationally-mandated guidelines for negotiations.</s> <s i="22">US President Bill Clinton tried in December 2000.</s> <s i="23">So has President George W. Bush, over the past three years.</s> <s i="24">He has affirmed US support for a two state solution, a viable Palestinian state, no return of Palestinian refugees to Israel and, implicitly, Israeli annexation of the large settlement blocs adjacent to the green line.</s> 

<s i="25">One problem with these presidential guidelines is that, at least on refugees, the two presidents themselves don't agree on a formula.</s> <s i="26">Another is that both Israel and Palestine take exception to one or another of the presidential criteria.</s> <s i="27">Indeed, had the Security Council gone beyond projecting a two state solution (1397) in March 2002 and tried to spell out a formula regarding, say, Jerusalem or refugees, the five major powers would have failed to reach agreement, and 1397 would not have passed.</s>
