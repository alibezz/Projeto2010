<s i="0">While the rest of the Arab world was experiencing a great blow to morale after the dramatic collapse of the Iraqi army and regime, Palestinians were having mixed feelings.</s> <s i="1">On the one hand, they shared the great sense of loss of their Arab brethren at the taking of the historic city of Baghdad.</s> <s i="2">On the other hand, Palestinian self-confidence was boosted as they remembered their heroic resistance in invasion after invasion, beginning with Beirut in 1982 and ending with Jenin in 2002.</s> 

<s i="3">What will happen on the Palestinian-Israeli track with the end of this war is the subject of heated debate.</s> <s i="4">Some analysts are saying that this war has shifted the balance of power further against the Arabs and consequently reduced the chances of a negotiated solution.</s> <s i="5">They believe that the end of the Iraq war will only encourage Israel�s appetite to end this conflict by force.</s> <s i="6">Their line of thought says that Israel will be spurred by the American army�s disregard in Iraq for human life and international law to carry out its own atrocities.</s> 

<s i="7">Their opponents, of course, argue that with the end of the war in Iraq, the American administration and the international community will have to balance out the regional scales by reducing damage done to their regional positioning and credibility--i.e. by addressing the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</s> <s i="8">Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon�s statements to Ha�aretz newspaper appear to confirm this second analysis.</s> <s i="9">When Sharon spoke of possibly renewing the peace process and the need for the Israeli public to be prepared for difficult decisions, including the dismantling of some settlements, he indicated that he expects some international efforts to be exerted vis-a-vis the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</s> <s i="10">He expects some pressure on Israel.</s> 

<s i="11">Indeed, Sharon�s statements were an attempt to inoculate his government against any imminent international pressure.</s> <s i="12">One need only recall Sharon�s previous style.</s> <s i="13">It is impossible to judge him and his government on speeches offered for public consumption.</s> <s i="14">Even as Sharon talks of dismantling settlements and advocates a Palestinian state, the military administration he commands over the occupied territories has been expanding Israeli settlement blocs--colonies in the very heart of the Palestinian state.</s> <s i="15">The major means of augmenting these settlements is currently the �separation wall� publicly proclaimed necessary for the protection of Israeli civilians, but which cartographers show will neatly slice away the majority of agricultural areas from the northern West Bank, placing them further in Israeli hands.</s> <s i="16">Speaking no less loudly about the need to alter or �reform� the Palestinian Authority in the name of security, Sharon has dismantled or rendered useless most aspects of the nascent Palestinian political entity--the nucleus of a Palestinian state.</s> 

<s i="17">Until the Israeli people realize that this right-wing approach is responsible for the ongoing suffering of both Palestinians and Israelis and the evaporation of the prospects for peace and economic prosperity, there is no opportunity for real peace.</s> <s i="18">In order to shorten the wait, the international community, led by the Quartet and including the United States, must seize this opportunity to invite the Israeli government and the Palestinian leadership back to the negotiating table after convincing both of them to replace their attempts to achieve objectives by force with peaceful talks.</s>
