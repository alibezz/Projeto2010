<s i="0">What possible chance does the new American &quot;benchmarks&quot; proposal have for improving internal Palestinian movement and security, when Hamas rejects it and Khalid Meshaal calls it a &quot;farce&quot;?</s> <s i="1">Even in the days before Hamas came to power in the Palestinian Authority, security plans proposed by the US and others in which PA forces were supposed to suppress and prevent attacks on Israelis generally failed for lack of a genuine and comprehensive Palestinian commitment.</s> <s i="2">Why is there a better chance now?</s>

<s i="3">Optimists cite two possible reasons.</s> <s i="4">First, Israeli PM Ehud Olmert appears to be genuinely committed to lightening the burden of Israeli checkpoints, roadblocks and other restrictions on Palestinian movement within the West Bank.</s> <s i="5">There are indications that the dialogue he has established with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is generating some sort of basis for progress.</s> <s i="6">Obviously, the sort of confidence-building measures comprised in the benchmark plan would be an important adjunct to a high-level Israeli-Palestinian political dialogue.</s> 

<s i="7">Secondly, the benchmarks plan is part and parcel of the effort made by US General Keith Dayton, in coordination with Israel, Jordan and Egypt, to beef up Abbas' Presidential Guard and organize the office of National Security Adviser Mohammad Dahlan in order to give forces loyal to Fateh and Abbas a stronger hand in Palestinian internal security affairs.</s> 

<s i="8">But these encouraging aspects of the environment accompanying the plan are more than overshadowed by the bad news.</s> <s i="9">For one, Olmert is on the way out; he is already a virtual lame duck prime minister thanks to the Winograd report.</s> <s i="10">Hence, under the very best circumstances there is little chance his dialogue with Abbas will get anywhere.</s> <s i="11">One indication of this growing political stalemate is the decision by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to cancel her monthly visit to Israel/Palestine.</s>

<s i="12">Then too, the Dayton plan does not appear capable of enabling Fateh to neutralize Hamas as a negative security factor.</s> <s i="13">On the contrary, by strengthening Fateh to the point where it might challenge Hamas, which has demonstrated clear superiority on the Gaza street, Dayton's scheme could reignite a Palestinian civil war and bring down the new unity government, thereby spreading chaos rather than security.</s> <s i="14">In general, the Dayton plan appears to reflect a broad American strategy--across the region, from Somalia via Palestine and Lebanon to Iraq--of strengthening internal forces that oppose militant Islamists.</s> <s i="15">Yet those Islamists in many cases owe their rise to power to US-supported democratization schemes.</s> <s i="16">The obvious contradictions embodied in this American approach are not lost on the peoples of the region.</s> <s i="17">In any case, the situation in Gaza is so anarchic that it may be too late for anyone to reestablish order.</s>

<s i="18">Finally, the Israeli security community has legitimate concerns regarding some of the proposed benchmarks.</s> <s i="19">In recent years, it has succeeded in radically reducing Palestinian suicide bombings and other attacks by aggressively cutting Gaza off from the West Bank and restricting movement inside the West Bank.</s> <s i="20">It has, in recent months, cancelled internal-West Bank travel restrictions here and there, e.g., in the Jordan Valley.</s> <s i="21">But it is not likely to relax its grip much further until and unless it perceives political developments that bespeak a firmer Palestinian hand on security.</s> <s i="22">It has already indicated publicly that it opposes the benchmark plan's provision that by July 1 bus convoys of Palestinians be allowed to travel five days a week between Gaza and the West Bank.</s> 

<s i="23">With the Olmert government teetering and a possible period of domestic Israeli political re-ordering ahead of us, there is no strong Israeli political leader who might countervail his security chiefs' advice.</s> <s i="24">Indeed, the main discussion currently on the Israeli security-political agenda concerns the severity of Israel's response to Hamas' build-up of weapons and construction of fortifications in the Gaza Strip, even as Qassam rocket firing and ambushes on Israeli patrols continue daily.</s>
