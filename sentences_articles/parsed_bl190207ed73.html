<s i="0">The Washington Post on February 16 described Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's trip to the region as a &quot;high-profile&quot; peace mission.</s> <s i="1">There was only one problem with the wording.</s> <s i="2">It appeared in a news-item on page 18, a clear indication of the relatively low priority the trip enjoys on the political agenda of the United States and therefore the very low probability of its success.</s>

<s i="3">Worse still is the common denominator shared by all those who attended the &quot;high-profile&quot; meeting: PM Ehud Olmert, President Mahmoud Abbas and Rice have already proven that they can &quot;deliver&quot; little if anything.</s> 

<s i="4">Abbas does not possess a politician's fighting instinct to make him an effective prime-minister in a country like Sweden, let alone be a leader in the tumultuous, violence-ridden Palestinian arena.</s> 

<s i="5">Olmert, trapped between the fiasco of his foray into Lebanon and seemingly never-ending corruption charges against him, competes with Abbas in poor leadership qualities, while Rice has been consistently unsuccessful in almost everything she has done, serving a president whose inclination is to deal with Iran but is increasingly compelled to defend his policies in Iraq.</s>

<s i="6">Yet leadership ability, particularly regarding Abbas, would be critical to any real attempt by Rice to advance a negotiation process.</s>

<s i="7">At the very minimum, renewing negotiations that involve give-and-take by definition requires two sides sufficiently coherent and solidified to engage in the business of exchange.</s> <s i="8">The Palestinians, by their own account, have yet to reach such a level of internal coherence and solidarity despite the fanfare accompanying the signing of the Mecca accord and the resignation of Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh as a first move toward the emergence of a unity government.</s> <s i="9">With a tally of 100 deaths linked to politically motivated violence since December, Palestinian skepticism seems well-founded.</s> <s i="10">Abbas' weakness has only fed rather than decreased Palestinian polarization.</s> 

<s i="11">Even more critically for Rice, the Palestinian president would clearly have to lead the unity government and the negotiations with Israel and Hamas would have to follow.</s> <s i="12">Yet this is the dynamic Abbas has consistently failed to establish since Hamas' electoral victory in January 2006.</s> <s i="13">To the contrary, one notable failure, his inability to thwart attempts to create Hamas' Executive Force and then prevent its consistent growth, may have already cost the Abbas camp the irretrievable loss of Gaza to Hamas.</s>

<s i="14">Rice knows that it was United States policy that gave Hamas the opportunity to win and gain the political clout that has since catapulted the Syrian-based and supported Hamas political leadership to the highest forums of Arab politics.</s> <s i="15">It was United States policy that placed the movement in a position where it adeptly aligned with Iran in order to initiate counter-bids and payoffs by the opposing Saudi side in the new Middle East cold war.</s> 

<s i="16">The US watched with dismay how the game paid off handsomely for Hamas in the Mecca agreement.</s> <s i="17">The precedent of a fundamentalist government coming to power by virtue of a United States-directed policy of democratization, if not checked, could prove disastrous to US and western interests.</s>
 
<s i="18">The secretary of state's mission, then, is hardly to made peace but rather to check radical fundamentalist power in Iran, Iraq and in the Palestinian arena.</s> <s i="19">In the Palestinian arena, this means to compel Abbas to be tougher toward Hamas in two important ways.</s> <s i="20">The first is to groom the leader tough enough to handle Hamas: Mohammad Dahlan.</s> <s i="21">The second move is to stop Hamas at all costs from creating any significant internal military force in Judea and Samaria.</s> 

<s i="22">Ostensibly, the Israeli leadership should be firmly behind these attempts.</s> <s i="23">But weak and fractious leadership is jeopardizing the attainment of goals Israel shares with the United States.</s> <s i="24">Olmert has caved in to pressures by Hamas' sister organization in Israel, the Islamic Movement, over the Temple Mount, thereby further bolstering the Islamists in the territories.</s>

<s i="25">Moreover, instead of preserving a non-existent ceasefire Olmert should have aimed, as in Judea and Samaria, to achieve a threshold of penetration that would allow preventive arrests of would-be rocket launchers.</s> <s i="26">Israel was beginning to achieve such a capability in the summer of 2006, after which it erred in adopting a policy of restraint.</s> 

<s i="27">Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Zippi Livni is harming Israel's strategic interests by trying to outflank Olmert with misguided liberal policies.</s> <s i="28">Instead, the order of the day should be firmness toward Palestinians in meeting internationally-sanctified goals that require Hamas to recognize Israel, accept rather than &quot;respect&quot; all existing agreements and totally cease terrorism.</s>
