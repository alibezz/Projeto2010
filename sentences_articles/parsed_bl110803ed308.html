<s i="0">The wall that Israel has been building in the Palestinian occupied territories under the pretext of security, the wall that is being called the apartheid wall by the Palestinian side, has lately drawn a great deal of high-level attention.</s> 

<s i="1">From a Palestinian point of view, this critical attention, including the pointed comments of United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and President George W. Bush, is a success of the ceasefire.</s> <s i="2">When things started to calm down, Israel found itself without justification for its practices.</s> <s i="3">The same can be said for Israel�s wide-reaching restrictions on movement, which make no security sense but are rather collective punishment of the entire Palestinian people.</s> <s i="4">Once the gun smoke cleared, Israel�s true intentions were laid bare.</s> 

<s i="5">In this climate, the continuation of Israeli settlement expansion, and the construction of the wall (a wall I have previously dubbed &quot;settlement plus&quot;) cannot be defended.</s> <s i="6">The growth of settlements and the expropriation of Palestinian land, both of which have intensified in recent weeks, expose the true nature of Israel�s practices in the occupied territories--to consolidate occupation by creating immovable facts on the ground and therefore prejudice the final outcome of negotiations, including the vision of President Bush, which is based on the two-state solution.</s> <s i="7">To soften the impact of this project on international public opinion, the Israelis insist on calling the massive several-layered barrier fortified with guard towers, electrified fencing and tiers of barbed wire a &quot;fence&quot; and describing it as a means to prevent Palestinians with violent intentions from infiltrating Israel.</s> 

<s i="8">But even Colin Powell expressed amazement that a country would try to &quot;defend&quot; its borders by building a concrete 24-foot-high wall deep inside the territory of another country--a neighbor with which Israel purportedly wants to live in peace.</s> <s i="9">The wall has been used as a pretext to confiscate more than 20,000 acres (80,000 dunams) of Palestinian agricultural land, which has subsequently caused unemployment in the towns of Tulkarem, Qalqilya and Jenin to rise to 70 percent.</s> <s i="10">There is no security logic here.</s>

<s i="11">Seen however, as an expansion project meant to colonize more land, the wall makes perfect sense.</s> <s i="12">It surrounds and isolates Palestinian population centers and villages from their open agricultural land, while further separating Palestinians from illegal Jewish settlements also built on their land.</s> <s i="13">It is part and parcel of other Israeli measures in the occupied territories which are creating two separate communities--one Jewish, the other Arab--that are separated physically and subject to two separate legal systems, economic opportunities, and restrictions down to the very roads they are allowed to drive on.</s> <s i="14">In South Africa, they called this apartheid.</s> 

<s i="15">If Israel is trying through this settlement consolidation project and like activities to prevent the practical possibility of a viable Palestinian state, then it is well on its way.</s> <s i="16">The result will mean a heavy price for Palestinians who will likely lose their opportunity for statehood, independence and self-determination--but Israel will also lose dearly as it gives up its opportunity to maintain a Jewish state.</s> <s i="17">If the two-state solution is impossible, the result will be one political entity between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.</s> <s i="18">Regardless of what the name of that place is or who controls it, the likelihood of it being a democratic Jewish state is pretty slim.</s>
