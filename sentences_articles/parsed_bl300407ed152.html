<s i="0">If the pause, or ceasefire, between Israel and the Palestinians in Gaza has not yet officially ended, it appears to be merely a matter of time before it does.</s> <s i="1">The buildup of armed forces in Gaza by Hamas and other militants has the Israeli security community on edge.</s> <s i="2">It is like the legendary pistol that appears in act I of a Chekhov play; by act III someone will fire it.</s>


<s i="3">Hamas, emulating Hizballah and with support from that organization and its Iranian patron, has smuggled tons of explosives under the Gaza-Sinai border, along with long range rockets and sophisticated anti-tank weapons.</s> <s i="4">It is also constructing heavy fortifications.</s> <s i="5">Israel is determined not to stand idly by while this goes on, as it did for years concerning southern Lebanon.</s> <s i="6">Hence at this point in time an Israeli land incursion of some sort into Gaza seems inevitable.</s> <s i="7">PM Ehud Olmert's government announced on April 25 that for the time being it would not respond to Hamas' provocative Independence Day barrage against Israel.</s> <s i="8">But this reflects short-term internal Israeli considerations--mainly anticipation of the Winograd report--more than grand strategic calculations.</s>


<s i="9">These developments mask a nuanced reality that bears examination if we are ever to extricate ourselves from the circle of violence.</s> <s i="10">For one, all Hamas forces do not appear to be sewn from one cloth.</s> <s i="11">Part of the political wing, led by PM Ismail Haniyeh, purports to support the ceasefire in order to reinforce the new unity government, while the military wing seems bent on sabotaging that government by escalating attacks against Israel.</s> <s i="12">Political or military, the Palestinian Islamist movement's version of the causes for the deterioration of conditions in Gaza blames Israel exclusively for Palestinian misery, happily ignoring the role played by its own terrorism and rejectionism and feeding the escalation of tensions.</s> 


<s i="13">On the other hand, Hamas described its independence day barrage not as a provocation but as a response to the IDF's killing of nine Palestinians--some innocent, some unarmed--in the course of anti-terrorist operations in the West Bank scarcely a day earlier.</s> <s i="14">Hamas and Islamic Jihad argue that the ceasefire applies to the West Bank as well, while Israel rejects that claim--a position confirmed by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas--as long as the Palestinians prove incapable of enforcing the &quot;pause&quot; even in Gaza.</s>


<s i="15">This returns us to Hamas' exploitation of the ceasefire to arm and fortify itself in Gaza, a charge Hamas does not deny.</s> <s i="16">Belligerents usually exploit ceasefires in order to rearm and redeploy; Israel, too, has done so.</s> <s i="17">Israel is also abetting the plan of America's General Keith Dayton to train and arm Fateh's Presidential Guard and to strengthen the office of PA National Security Adviser Muhammad Dahlan as a counter to Hamas in Gaza.</s> <s i="18">This is hardly reassuring news for the Hamas leadership, even though there is nothing to indicate that the retrained Fateh force will be any more efficient as a security unit than its predecessor, Force 17.</s>


<s i="19">At the heart of this scheme is the notion that Hamas' election victory of January 2006, facilitated by the US, can be reversed and the two-state oriented Fateh restored to a position of power.</s> <s i="20">It is a doubtful proposition; it could make matters worse by bringing about the ultimate collapse of the PA.


In contrast, Saudi Arabia spearheaded the efforts to form a Palestinian unity government and now claims that it has maneuvered Hamas onto the path of eventually accepting a two-state solution.</s> <s i="21">This effort, too, warrants skepticism in view of Hamas' militant Islamist nature.</s> <s i="22">Still, a renewal of full-scale Israeli-Palestinian hostilities in and around the Gaza Strip will surely be seen as a setback for this cause, and could damage prospects for cooperation between Israel and the Arab League under the umbrella of the recently re-ratified Arab peace initiative.</s> <s i="23">Nor will it really put a stop to terrorism from Gaza for any length of time.</s> <s i="24">And it could involve heavy Israeli losses.</s>


<s i="25">At the end of the day, a ceasefire will never amount to more than a lull in the fighting unless the belligerents find a way to talk.</s> <s i="26">Yet Hamas refuses to talk to Israel, even informally, while Olmert and the international community insist on a set of preconditions for formal contacts that, however logical and reasonable, are unacceptable even to Hamas' politicians, not to mention its terrorists.</s>
