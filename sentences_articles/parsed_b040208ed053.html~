<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><output><s i="0">The Ehud Olmert-led government seems unperturbed by the Winograd report.</s> <s i="1">This means that business will continue as usual, including the pursuit of peace negotiations with the Palestinian Authority.</s> <s i="2">Yet the chances of reaching an agreement are dismal; the main reason for this assessment is the issue of Jerusalem.</s> <s i="3">The Palestinian demand to partition Jerusalem is a major obstacle to peace.</s>

<s i="4">The Palestinians and most of the international community fail to understand that then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak's offer to divide Jerusalem at the Camp David summit in 2000 was divorced from the strong attachment a majority of Israelis feel toward the eternal city.</s> <s i="5">This incredible concession has continually lacked the necessary domestic political support.</s> <s i="6">Strategic considerations also dictate holding on to a greater Jerusalem.</s>

<s i="7">Israeli public opinion is committed to maintaining the status quo in Jerusalem.</s> <s i="8">A recent poll shows that 68 percent of Israelis feel that Jerusalem should remain the united capital of Israel while only 29 percent favor its division and becoming the capital of both a Jewish state and a future Palestinian state.</s> <s i="9">The group of Israelis showing the largest support (78 percent) in favor of Jerusalem remaining the undivided capital was the age range of 18 to 24 year olds.</s> <s i="10">Of this group, the strongest support was expressed by ultra-orthodox and religious Israelis, who are the fastest growing segments in the Jewish population.</s> <s i="11">When asked whether Israel should relinquish its control over the Temple Mount, over 70 percent of Israelis disagree.</s> 

<s i="12">After Barak's offer in 2000, over 250,000 people demonstrated their opposition to his violation of the Jerusalem taboo, in the largest rally ever held in Israel.</s> <s i="13">The electrifying hold of Jerusalem on the Jewish psyche is not sufficiently appreciated.</s> <s i="14">Moreover, the orthodox injunction against visiting the Temple Mount has eroded, allowing for a growing number of Israelis the mystic experience of meeting a methaphysical past and future.</s> <s i="15">Such feelings are politically potent, foreclosing the possibility that Israelis will sit idly by and watch a transfer of sovereignty.</s>

<s i="16">In 2000, the division of Jerusalem lacked the necessary majority in the Knesset; Barak's coalition disintegrated (for other reasons as well).</s> <s i="17">Similarly, in 2008, Prime Minister Olmert has experienced coalition difficulties because he placed Jerusalem on the negotiators' agenda.</s> <s i="18">The Yisrael Beitenu party has already left the coalition in opposition to talks over permanent status issues, while Shas threatens to do likewise if the government starts discussing Jerusalem with the Palestinians.</s> <s i="19">Even elements within the ruling Kadima party will likely desert the coalition if Jerusalem is touched.</s> <s i="20">At least one Laborite (Yoram Marziano) shares a similar position.</s> <s i="21">Olmert was forced to delay negotiating this issue or risk the collapse of his government.</s> 

<s i="22">No Israeli government is likely to survive concessions in Jerusalem under the current political constellation, which is unlikely to change.</s> <s i="23">If elections are held in the near future, the strength of opposition to any concessions in Jerusalem will only grow.</s>

<s i="24">Jerusalem's importance to the Jews is not only historic and religious; the city also holds strategic importance in controlling the only highway from the Mediterranean coast to the Jordan Valley along which military forces can move with little interference from Arab population concentrations.</s> <s i="25">Jerusalem is the linchpin for erecting a security zone along the Jordan Rift.</s> <s i="26">If Israel wants to maintain a defensible border in the east, it needs to secure the east-west axis from the coast to the Jordan Valley via an undivided Jerusalem and Maaleh Adumim.</s> 

<s i="27">Keeping greater Jerusalem, which includes the settlement blocs that President Bush recognized as realities that must be accommodated in a future settlement, is a strategic imperative.</s> <s i="28">Arguments that ignore the immense potential for political upheaval east of the Jordan River and the fluctuating nature of military technology in order to minimize the military importance of Jerusalem and its central role in Israel's eastern line of defense are opportunistic.</s> <s i="29">Designing stable and defensible borders in accordance with current, but transient, technological state-of-the-art and political circumstances is strategically foolish.</s>

<s i="30">Finally, the partition of Jerusalem is simply a bad idea when the Zeitgeist dictates uniting cities such as Berlin, Belfast or Nicosia.</s> <s i="31">Why should Jerusalem be different?</s> <s i="32">Jews have held a majority in the city for the past 150 years.</s> <s i="33">The Palestinian demand to apply the principle of self-determination to Ramallah is valid for Jerusalem as well.</s> <s i="34">Even the Arab minority in the city has shown its preference for living under Israeli rule, as many have moved to the Israeli side of the security barrier being built around Jerusalem.</s> <s i="35">Their choice is reasonable, as Jerusalem offers the quality of life of a modern western city while only a few kilometers away the norm is a third world standard of living, chaos and religious intolerance.</s> <s i="36">An undivided Jerusalem is the best guarantee of a better life for all Jerusalemites.</s>
