<s i="0">Former US president Jimmy Carter's most recent trip to the Middle East generated much debate, especially because he met with Khaled Mishaal, Hamas' political bureau chief, in Damascus.</s> <s i="1">Carter's reputation and the high profile nature of the visit, which included visits with neighboring heads of states, could only signal another important recognition of Hamas as a major political player in the region.</s> <s i="2">This is in line with the rising political power of political Islamic movements across the region.</s> 

<s i="3">While Ehud Olmert, the prime minister of Israel, must have been listening carefully to what Carter had to say, he did not meet with him.</s> <s i="4">Carter had already become persona non grata in many Zionist quarters because of his book, &quot;Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid&quot;.</s> <s i="5">In the book Carter asserted that, &quot;Israel's continued control and colonization of Palestinian land have been the primary obstacles to a comprehensive peace agreement in the Holy Land.</s> <s i="6">In order to perpetuate the occupation, Israeli forces have deprived their unwilling subjects of basic human rights.</s> <s i="7">No objective person could personally observe existing conditions in the West Bank and dispute these statements.&quot;</s> 

<s i="8">In his book, Carter is also critical of some Palestinian behavior.</s> <s i="9">Yet despite this, and his status as a Nobel laureate and his role in the Camp David peace agreement between Egypt and Israel, he was accused of being anti-Semitic for labeling the occupation as &quot;apartheid&quot;.</s> <s i="10">That opinion is not shared by all Israelis.</s> <s i="11">Former minister Yossi Sarid reacted last week to the labeling of Carter as anti-Semitic with an article in Haaretz confirming Carter's thesis entitled, &quot;Yes, it is apartheid&quot;.</s>

<s i="12">Carter was also opposed to the war on Iraq.</s> <s i="13">His position was premised on basic religious principles and respect for international law.</s> <s i="14">The war on Iraq could not meet the conditions for a &quot;just war&quot; as a Christian theological concept.</s> <s i="15">According to Carter, this position was universal among Christians except for a &quot;few spokesmen of the Southern Baptist Convention who are greatly influenced by their commitment to Israel based on eschatological, or final days, theology&quot;.</s> <s i="16">In addition, Carter is against military action against Iran and advocates maximum political engagement, a position that runs contrary to Israel's belligerent policy vis-a-vis states building nuclear capabilities in the region.</s> 

<s i="17">Carter was highly critical of those who rejected Hamas' victory in the fair and democratic Palestinian general elections.</s> <s i="18">Monitors from his Carter Center observed the 2006 elections in which Hamas won a majority of parliamentary (i.e., Palestinian Legislative Council) seats.</s> <s i="19">He believed that this should have entitled Hamas to lead the Palestinian people.</s> <s i="20">He called on western governments not to favor Fateh over Hamas as this deepens the conflict between the rival Palestinian factions.</s> <s i="21">One could make a passing mention of the Vanity Fair magazine report on US support for elements in Fateh before Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip in June 2007 that attests to this favoritism.</s> 

<s i="22">The result was disastrous.</s> 

<s i="23">Today, the Palestinian Authority, which is essentially Fateh, and Hamas negatively mirror each other in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, including a daily barrage of ad hominem attacks aired on their respective TV stations.</s> <s i="24">The main difference is that in the West Bank, while still suffering under Israeli occupation, the Palestinian Authority, at this stage in its history, is treated by Israel with kid gloves.</s> <s i="25">The Gaza Strip, on the other hand, is hermetically sealed, with humanitarian aid brought virtually to a standstill by the lack of fuel supply, which is controlled and sold by Israel.</s> <s i="26">Israel controls the movement of goods and people to the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="27">Carter himself was not allowed to enter, and he could only meet Hamas leaders from the Gaza Strip in Egypt.</s> <s i="28">It is not clear what Israel gains from this kind of treatment of Carter.</s>

<s i="29">The appalling conditions in the Gaza Strip must weigh heavily on the nature of the ceasefire under discussion nowadays.</s> <s i="30">While in Egypt, Mahmoud Zahar, the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, confirmed the movement's approval of calm (tahdiyeh) in the Gaza Strip for six months during which a ceasefire should be extended to the West Bank.</s> <s i="31">This is in exchange for easing the restrictions on the Gaza Strip by opening the crossings.</s> 

<s i="32">The fact that Hamas agreed to the Gaza-first ceasefire could be considered a concession.</s> <s i="33">Mishaal stated that Hamas' position is a response to an Egyptian proposal.</s> <s i="34">He also said that Hamas would agree to a de facto two-state solution, without recognizing Israel.</s> <s i="35">There continue to be no direct channels of communication between Israel and Hamas.</s> <s i="36">According to Carter, his visit took place precisely because of this lack of communication, which he considers counterproductive.</s>
