<s i="0">There are clear indications that a political process is likely to start between Palestinians and Israelis in 2007.</s> <s i="1">To what degree it will be a credible process that avoids all the pitfalls of the Oslo &quot;peace process&quot; is an open question, however.</s> <s i="2">What is unquestionable since the end of last June, when the Israeli army invaded Gaza, is that the planned second &quot;unilateral&quot; withdrawal from the West Bank is shelved and &quot;unilateralism&quot; has failed.</s>

<s i="3">The purpose behind such withdrawals was in part to generate &quot;movement&quot; to fill the political vacuum resulting from freezing the &quot;roadmap&quot;, to which the Israeli cabinet under former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon appended fourteen conditions for it to be acceptable.</s> <s i="4">Sharon succeeded in convincing the Bush administration to support unilateral withdrawals in lieu of a political process, and thus fill the political vacuum resulting from the failure to quell the second intifada by military means.</s> 

<s i="5">The shelving of &quot;unilateralism&quot;, being its only agenda, left Kadima without a raison d'etre.</s> <s i="6">But the war on Lebanon created yet another need for a political process if regional alliances stretching to Palestine were to be separated, all in the context of a failing US policy in Iraq and the possibility of a wider regional conflagration that many US allies in the Middle East fear.</s>

<s i="7">Leaks in the Hebrew press concerning a &quot;peace plan&quot; being prepared by Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni appeared several weeks ago.</s> <s i="8">In a December 29 interview in Haaretz, she herself made the broad outlines clear.</s> <s i="9">Her &quot;operative diplomatic plan&quot;, as she described it, involves &quot;dividing up the country&quot; with the separation wall as the &quot;reference point&quot;.</s> <s i="10">A Palestinian state with &quot;temporary&quot; borders is to be established, with a &quot;final status&quot; agreement to be left for the future.</s>

<s i="11">There isn't much new in the plan, except that it has come from an Israeli and American point of view.</s> <s i="12">In addition to the regional situation, the withdrawal from Gaza was proof that Israel needs a Palestinian partner, and this requires &quot;movement&quot; on the political front.</s> <s i="13">In terms of substance, the nominal threshold from &quot;expanded self rule&quot; envisioned by earlier Israeli politicians to a &quot;state&quot; with the &quot;trappings of sovereignty&quot; has already been crossed.</s> <s i="14">Sharon himself said in an interview shortly after he became prime minister in early 2001 that he is not opposed to a Palestinian &quot;state&quot; in half of the West Bank.</s> 

<s i="15">Evidently, not much has been learned from the failures of the Oslo process.</s> <s i="16">It is clear that open-ended &quot;interim&quot; arrangements have a way of extending their life expectancy until another conflagration erupts.</s> <s i="17">The problem is not in principle with stages, but with the specific guarantees that the end-goal will be reached in a defined period, if such &quot;guarantees&quot; are at all possible or credible.</s> <s i="18">The Israeli-Palestinian &quot;peace process&quot; attests to this.</s>

<s i="19">No wonder then that President Mahmoud Abbas continues to call for immediate final negotiations, while rejecting the idea of a &quot;state with temporary borders&quot;, especially if the final outcome is not agreed upon before the beginning of any political process.</s> 

<s i="20">What we should therefore expect in this new year are even more difficult negotiations than at any time before.</s> <s i="21">Yet there is an opportunity for a credible political process provided two conditions apply.</s> <s i="22">First, the solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should not be left as a domestic Israeli issue governed by the electoral and local needs of Israeli politicians.</s> <s i="23">It is clear that here there is a need for an impartial and vigorous Arab and international role, a role the US has not played and could not play given Israeli influence on its policies in the Middle East.</s>
