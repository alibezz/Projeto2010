<s i="0">The conciliatory tone of US President Barack Obama's speech delivered in Cairo has attracted widespread praise.</s> <s i="1">Many skeptics, however, are asking if and how these words will be translated into action, particularly in relation to the Arab-Israel conflict.</s> 

<s i="2">The recent history of US engagement in Israel-Arab relations provides grounds for skepticism.</s> <s i="3">However, this speech and other preparatory actions taken by this new US president do offer some encouragement to those who seek a more even-handed approach from the US.</s> <s i="4">It is essential that the Arabs and Palestinians give President Obama the benefit of the doubt, at least for a limited period, and avoid acting as spoilers of his declared intention to be an honest broker.</s>

<s i="5">Ordinary citizens, as well as seasoned analysts, began poring over the text of Obama's speech from the moment it was first posted on the web, just minutes after he left the podium at al-Azhar University.</s> <s i="6">They are finding many examples of Obama's intention to be frank and even-handed.</s> 

<s i="7">He made a direct link, in consecutive paragraphs, between the tragedy of the Nakba and the Shoah.</s> <s i="8">He unequivocally called for a Palestinian state and used the word &quot;Palestine&quot;--something that previous US presidents have avoided.</s> <s i="9">In addition to repeating his demand for an end to the settlement enterprise, he stopped short of supporting the concept of a Jewish state, preferring the term &quot;Jewish homeland&quot;.</s> <s i="10">He effectively called upon Palestinians to pursue peaceful resistance, whilst equating their struggle for rights and freedom to that of black Americans and South Africans.</s> <s i="11">There was even an acknowledgement of Hamas' legitimacy as a representative of the Palestinian people.</s> 

<s i="12">And he didn't use the word &quot;terrorism&quot;--not once in 6,000 words lasting 56 minutes.</s> <s i="13">These are not coincidences or missteps.</s> <s i="14">This president and his speechwriters are well aware of the novelty of these messages coming from the US leadership; and they are cognizant of the disquiet they will cause among the Israeli political and military leadership and the settler communities.</s>

<s i="15">Obama has also made some significant gestures in the way he has related to the Arab world, Palestine and Israel since taking office less than five months ago.</s> <s i="16">King Abdullah of Jordan, a sharp critic of the new rightist Israeli government who speaks openly of his distaste for Binyamin Netanyahu, was the first Middle East leader to be welcomed into Obama's White House.</s> <s i="17">The US president overflew Israel on his way to Cairo last week and won't be paying Netanyahu a visit for a while yet.</s> <s i="18">The president has also appointed a slew of advisers and staffers who have a history of taking an uncompromising line on settlements, most notably Special Envoy George Mitchell and National Security Adviser General Jim Jones.</s> <s i="19">And Obama's chief of staff has been vilified by Israelis as a &quot;self-hater&quot; for his perceived role in formulating &quot;anti-Israel&quot;</s> <s i="20">US policies.</s>

<s i="21">US domestic political commentators who have observed Obama's career closely repeatedly refer to his genuine interest in the experience--and often suffering--of the ordinary citizen.</s> <s i="22">This interest has been given its most recent expression in his nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court.</s> <s i="23">She is undoubtedly a woman of great intellect, but also a woman of the world who has a deep appreciation of how it feels to be at the bottom of the pile.</s> <s i="24">In hearing his words in Cairo, in particular his description of the suffering of Palestinians, one wonders if he is the first US president in a long time to sense the brutality and the injustice of the occupation.</s>

<s i="25">In his speech, Obama quite rightly pointed to the responsibilities that Arabs and Palestinians share in helping bring an end to the conflict and building the state of Palestine.</s> <s i="26">Palestinian unity is an imperative regardless of Obama's speech.</s> <s i="27">Even if Obama does not fulfill his early promise, we must be united.</s> 

<s i="28">However, if his words are truly to be translated to deeds, Palestinians must be facilitators, not spoilers.</s> <s i="29">If we remain divided, we run the serious risk of being labeled the opponents of peace.</s> <s i="30">This does not mean we have to relinquish our resistance to the occupation, but we do need to pursue resistance more intelligently.</s> <s i="31">It also does not mean that we should allow ourselves to be dragged back into open-ended negotiations.</s> <s i="32">The US, Israel and the broader international community need to understand that there is a limit to our patience, and that we need to see rapid and tangible steps toward dismantling the infrastructure of the occupation.</s>

<s i="33">United Arab support is also essential.</s>  <s i="34">As President Obama stated, the Arab Peace Initiative is an important beginning, but not the end of the Arab role.</s> <s i="35">The stability and development of the region depend on concerted Arab support for the establishment of a stable state of Palestine.</s> <s i="36">They will need to expend political capital in their own countries in the long-term interest.</s> <s i="37">However, they need to be persuaded that the price is worth paying.</s> <s i="38">The Arab nations, their leaders and their citizens, need to see an early and tangible return on their investment.</s> <s i="39">They need to see an end to the suffering and indignity that has become part of the daily experience of Palestinians living under occupation.</s>

<s i="40">In his famous &quot;Wind of Change&quot; speech delivered in both Accra and Cape Town in 1960, British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan said, &quot;it is our earnest desire to give South Africa our support and encouragement, but I hope you won't mind my saying frankly that there are some aspects of your policies which make it impossible for us to do this without being false to our own deep convictions about the political destinies of free men.&quot;</s>
