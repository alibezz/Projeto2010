   <s i="0">The launch of the peace process at the beginning of the 1990s also instigated a large number of peace initiatives, activities, organizations, etc., which at face value aimed at encouraging and promoting peacemaking between Israel, the Palestinians and Arab countries.</s> 

<s i="1">These initiatives sprung up for many different reasons.</s> <s i="2">Some were fortified by honest intentions, at both government and non-government levels, and were characterized by a serious desire to facilitate relations between Israelis and Palestinians and encourage the two parties to move ahead toward achieving the objectives of the peace process.</s>

<s i="3">Some were motivated by a desire to promote specific political agendas on either side or by third parties.</s> <s i="4">Some were motivated by opportunism with individuals either interested in the money or the glory.</s>
 
<s i="5">The peace process was certainly in need of encouragement and facilitation by third parties.</s> <s i="6">The peace camps and political leaders driving the endeavor had to show their respective publics that the peace process paid dividends and could make practical changes in people's day-to-day lives.</s> 

<s i="7">But these organizations were only ever meant to be supporting actors to the headline cast.</s> <s i="8">At some point, however, the importance of this aspect of peacemaking became exaggerated to a point where some parties, whether on either side or from third countries, thought that maybe these auxiliary efforts could compensate the parties for the absence of substantial achievement in the actual process.</s>

<s i="9">Perhaps some of those involved in these activities on the Palestinian side were not aware of what should have been clear from the outset: for all the benefits of economic and development aid, job creation, democratization, gender equality and so on, none of these could ever substitute for real, substantive progress in reaching the conclusion of the peace process and the end, for Palestinians, of occupation.</s> 

<s i="10">That might be also correct for the other side.</s> <s i="11">However there is no symmetry here, because one party is enjoying the basic rights of human beings in society while the other is being deprived, whether of citizenship or statehood or any of the other privileges that are consequences of such rights.</s> 

<s i="12">Unfortunately, donor countries, particularly in the West, knew they were caught in a dilemma: on the one hand, it was clear what peace required and what the land for peace formula stood for; on the other, whether for real political, narrow interest group pressure, historical or other reasons, most of these countries were unable to take the clear, principled and determined stand such an outcome required.</s> 

<s i="13">Thus, many of these governments started to compensate with all manner of generosity by establishing humanitarian, peace, dialogue, bridge-building and development organizations.</s>

<s i="14">This led to the flourishing of a peace industry with hundreds of millions of dollars being brandished in order to encourage anything &quot;joint&quot;, anything at all, as long as both Palestinians and Israelis were involved.</s> <s i="15">That in turn created a space for people to try to make money out of this enterprise without necessarily having or intending any serious effect on the substantial relations between the two sides.</s>

<s i="16">In fact, it was Ariel Sharon who brought to an end the real and serious interactions between the two sides with his separation strategy that culminated in the building of the wall.</s> <s i="17">This strategy prevented any natural and healthy interaction between Palestinians and Israelis.</s> <s i="18">What was left were artificial interactions, with people needing either permits from the Israeli army to meet or large sums of money to travel to third countries to do so.</s> 

<s i="19">Let me be clear: the organizations that aim to promote peace can be very useful, but only under specific conditions.</s> <s i="20">First, their work has to function in support of a real political process rather than in the place of such a process.</s> <s i="21">Second, the actual activities have to be genuine rather than artificial in the sense that they have to be based on the real needs of the two sides.</s> 

<s i="22">The period just before and on the eve of the peace process witnessed examples of such genuine activities, with Israeli peace activists coming to show solidarity with Palestinians under curfew or Palestinians threatened with the demolition of their houses, the uprooting of their trees or the confiscation of their land.</s> <s i="23">At the same time, Palestinians benefited from training opportunities, medical treatment in Israel and the fulfillment of other genuine needs that could be met by the Israeli side.</s>
