<s i="0">The ceasefire agreement that was agreed upon by all major Palestinian factions several weeks ago is viewed by Palestinians as a miracle.</s> <s i="1">Prior to this watershed, it was difficult to imagine the possibility that these groups with such differences of opinion on practical and strategic matters might come to a consensus--never mind one that would hold.</s> 

<s i="2">True, this surprising consensus is driven by a wide range of objectives.</s> <s i="3">Each faction or leader has hopes of gaining in a particular way by pursuing the ceasefire.</s> <s i="4">Many are adhering to the ceasefire because it will allow the Palestinian leadership to fulfill a major obligation of the roadmap plan: to &quot;end armed activity against Israelis anywhere.&quot;</s> <s i="5">Others are seeking to pressure Israel towards reciprocity, which, according to the roadmap, means &quot;ending violence against Palestinians everywhere.&quot;</s> <s i="6">But there are still other Palestinians and Palestinian factions who are adhering to the ceasefire because they feel that the majority of the Palestinian public wants to give the ceasefire a chance.</s> <s i="7">These factions want to appeal to the Palestinian majority.</s> 

<s i="8">Needless to say, officials in the Palestinian Authority view the ceasefire as a means of fulfilling Palestiniansï¿½ obligations, particularly pertaining to security, that are written into the roadmap.</s> <s i="9">At this moment, it is difficult for the Palestinian leadership to do much more than ask Palestinian factions for a ceasefire, since there has been very little reciprocity by Israel that would create an atmosphere conducive to more advanced security intervention.</s> 

<s i="10">Later on, the Palestinian Authority is asked to take practical measures against any person or group that violates any aspect of the roadmap and its commitments.</s> <s i="11">There is a reason that this was delayed, and that is to allow the Palestinian Authority to rebuild its security apparatus (which, according to experts here should take six months and requires that Israeli troops withdraw to allow for the free passage of Palestinian security officers).</s> <s i="12">The additional time is also intended to reap some political achievements for the Palestinian Authority which would give the leadership political capital to invest in the second phase, a period focused on maintaining law and order, re-establishing a single authority and other aspects of public security.</s>

<s i="13">What is needed now, in order for the ceasefire to stick, is a series of developments that would spur the Palestinian public to gain interest in the roadmap.</s> <s i="14">In other words, the Palestinian Authority is arguing that the previous violence did not bring Palestinians any closer to their national objectives and that non-violence should enable them to become more effective in ending the occupation.</s> <s i="15">If Israel were to fulfill its obligations encoded in the first phase of the roadmap (an end to settlement expansion, the dismantling of checkpoints and roadblocks inside the occupied territories, and the opening of closed Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem) these developments should offer enough momentum and reward that the Palestinian public will want to continue upon this path.</s> 

<s i="16">If this does not happen, however, and if Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas is not able to show his public that non-violence is more useful than violence, and if Israel continues its ongoing campaign of arresting activists, confiscating land and imposing upon us the apartheid wall, which will encircle our communities and choke our economy, then the course of events will lead right into the hands of those who argue: &quot;no matter what we do or do not do, this Israeli government has no intention of replacing the current violent relationship with a peaceful one.&quot;</s>

<s i="17">The Palestinian Authority has no means of pressuring Israel to reciprocate with its obligations and is seeking an active American role of the kind that would deliver Israel to the roadmap in the same manner that the United States has succeeded in delivering the Palestinians to their obligations.</s> <s i="18">Otherwise, the current calm, which is truly a golden opportunity for political progress, will be short-lived and end in catastrophe.</s>
