<s i="0">It is hard to overestimate the importance of Palestinian parliamentary elections at a time when the ever-growing chaos on the streets of Palestine has left everyone feeling insecure and confused.</s>

<s i="1">To add to the instability of the situation there is now a growing percentage of people within Fateh opposed to holding elections on the set date.</s> <s i="2">While many are claiming to be against holding elections now because of the situation on the street and Israeli measures in Jerusalem and elsewhere, there is no doubt that divisions within Fateh are playing an important role in this trend.</s> 

<s i="3">The list of tasks that a new parliament needs to tackle is endless.</s> <s i="4">From unemployment and poverty to a consistent and unified strategy vis-a-vis Israel, the need for new blood in the PLC is pressing.</s> <s i="5">The current parliament has sat for nearly ten years, and the situation has only become worse.</s> 

<s i="6">The first priority has to be stabilizing the internal situation.</s> <s i="7">People are clamoring for a strong government, and only a strong government will be able to impose some order.</s> <s i="8">But, for a government to be strong, it needs legitimacy.</s> <s i="9">Such legitimacy can only come through a popular vote.</s>

<s i="10">The call to postpone elections is therefore a bad sign.</s> <s i="11">Undoubtedly, President Mahmoud Abbas is aware of this, and so far he has resisted all Fateh pressure to put off the vote.</s> <s i="12">As a consequence, the pressure is being applied in different ways, and there is little doubt that the recent increase in chaos is directly related to attempts to postpone elections.</s> <s i="13">Israeli measures to prevent balloting in Jerusalem as well as the obstacles placed in front of other facets of the elections process--such as allowing candidates to travel and campaign--also play a part.</s> <s i="14">Some Fateh leaders have withdrawn their candidacy and others have even threatened to disrupt voting on polling day.</s>

<s i="15">Nevertheless, postponement is a real possibility, and aware of this, Fateh and Hamas leaders have in recent days sat to discuss the possible consequences and alternative scenarios.</s> <s i="16">There has reportedly been a suggestion that an emergency government, with the participation of Hamas, could be established until elections are held.</s>

<s i="17">So far Hamas is not budging.</s> <s i="18">Elections were postponed before, and there is no guarantee that they won't be postponed again.</s> <s i="19">In addition, an emergency government might be seriously limited in what it could achieve, and Hamas is not interested in squandering popular credibility before it has proved itself at the ballot box.</s> <s i="20">On the other hand, elections are not much good to Hamas should the majority of Fateh decide to boycott.</s> <s i="21">It is a difficult position to be in.</s>

<s i="22">Hamas, however, is unlikely to resort to violence.</s> <s i="23">The lack of law and order, which in the public mind is blamed on the PA and the absence of the security forces, is a major reason for the growing popularity of the movement.</s> <s i="24">Hamas would not want to come to be seen as a contributing factor.</s>

<s i="25">Much has been made recently of the expiry of the so-called ceasefire, the calm Hamas and other opposition factions agreed with President Abbas back in March of last year.</s> <s i="26">But from the perspective of the Palestinian factions the calm never really existed, in fact was broken by Israel within two weeks of the agreement.</s> <s i="27">The reason some kind of calm nevertheless was created and maintained for so long was in part due to PA pressure and Fateh support, and in part due to Hamas' unwillingness to rock the boat in the run-up to elections.</s>

<s i="28">In addition, the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza also meant the removal of the most easily reached targets.</s> <s i="29">The situation in the West Bank is much more complicated as regards armed resistance.</s> <s i="30">With the lack of any political change, however, whether internally or with Israel, there is no doubt that the factions will resume their resistance at any and all opportunity.</s> <s i="31">Certainly, no one feels bound any longer by the agreement reached in Cairo.</s>

<s i="32">Elections might serve to create a common strategy for how to confront Israel.</s> <s i="33">Hamas believes there must be a mix between armed resistance and political negotiations.</s> <s i="34">It is a belief rooted in the fact that after ten years of PA negotiations with Israel, little or nothing has been achieved.</s>  <s i="35">It is around such a strategy that Hamas is hoping to find national consensus.</s> <s i="36">Such national consensus is important not only for internal strength but for external credibility.</s> <s i="37">If Palestinians speak with one voice, the message is more likely to be heard and respected by Israel.</s>
