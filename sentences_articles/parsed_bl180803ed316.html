<s i="0">From the political point of view, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process was jump-started with the signing of the Oslo Accords.</s> <s i="1">A famous handshake between two enemies raised hopes for a peaceful future, close at hand.</s> <s i="2">Since then, it has become clear that such diplomatic efforts alone are insufficient to bring peace to the Israeli and Palestinian communities who have been adversaries for so many years.</s> 

<s i="3">Political leaders may attempt, and occasionally succeed, to conclude agreements about borders, water and security, but their efforts, vital as they may be, are conducted in the rarefied atmosphere of high level international diplomacy.</s> <s i="4">They do not directly advance reconciliation between peoples.</s> <s i="5">In order to create a just and stable peace between Israelis and Palestinians, individuals, communities and civil institutions must join hands with the diplomats to facilitate deep changes in attitudes.</s> <s i="6">The way to do this is to design, implement and participate in creative joint activities that challenge existing stereotypes.</s>

<s i="7">Even the most honest, good faith implementation of political agreements cannot repair the chiasmic psychological, emotional and educational fault lines opened after years of conflict.</s> <s i="8">If left unattended, these &quot;black holes&quot; can swallow up years of hard diplomatic effort.</s> <s i="9">Our painful experience has taught us that we have no choice but to recognize the educational system as playing a strategic role in the political process.</s> <s i="10">This is important for two reasons.</s>

<s i="11">First, the education systems can only be used as a means for dissemination of peace if their legitimacy as shapers of attitudes is restored and recognized by political leaders.</s> <s i="12">Addressing these issues on the strategic level shows to the peoples on both sides that ultimately it is their commitment to peace and reconciliation that will assure the outcome of the political process.</s> <s i="13">If the political leaders fail to recognize the role of the educational institutions in the process and in future stability, how can we expect the next generation to put its faith in that same system?</s> <s i="14">Already we witness the strong negative effects of the mass media, as the issue of incitement is raised as a tool for each side to de-legitimize the other.</s> <s i="15">If we do not recognize educational institutions as vehicles to create and affect society, we leave a vacuum for others, proponents of hate and conflict, to fill.</s>

<s i="16">Secondly, in trying to create stability in a region so wounded and affected by violence and war, the educational institutions must be seen as central partners in the rehabilitative process.</s> <s i="17">One of the fundamental building blocks of a stable reality is an educational system that enhances the capacities, values and responsibilities of citizens.</s> <s i="18">This is not a question of how a child learns to perceive his or her former enemy, but rather a larger question of how a child becomes capable and confident to provide for his or her future.</s> <s i="19">Peace and security cannot be guaranteed by security measures alone which, as necessary as they are, can often antagonize and divide.</s> <s i="20">Such security measures will serve their purpose if they are enforced in the context of a civil society, which can exist and flourish only if supported by an effective and exciting educational system.</s> <s i="21">Thus, politicians and diplomats will find their efforts frustrated if they do not work strategically to assure an accommodating educational environment.</s>

<s i="22">What do we mean when we speak of education on the strategic level?</s> <s i="23">Clearly this does not imply that the political negotiators should begin to design textbooks or argue over relevant curricula.</s> <s i="24">It also does not mean that mere lip service should be paid to the need for including values of understanding and peace within the educational curricula.</s> <s i="25">These are issues that need to be developed on the professional level, much as any other strategic area of the negotiations.</s> <s i="26">Creating a strategic place for the educational systems would mean that just as the negotiators on all levels consult military experts, economic experts, diplomatic experts and sometimes health and media experts as well, so too an educational track should be consulted.</s> <s i="27">Once this is recognized, then there is a legitimate role for education in implementation, too.</s> <s i="28">A negotiating and follow-up educational committee should be created alongside all other such committees.</s>

<s i="29">The content of the educational component of a peace agreement would need to address the following issues:

1.</s>	<s i="30">How to ensure that schools will be accessible and safe environments for all children ages 3-18;
2.</s>	<s i="31">How to provide adequate support (including compensation) for teachers to contend with (a) the dynamic changes in the reality, and (b) the suffering and trauma of themselves and their students;
3.</s>	<s i="32">How to address issues of a core unified curriculum; to what extent is such a curriculum advisable in creating a stable, confident and open-minded society;
4.</s>	<s i="33">How to address the role of communications (mainly TV, radio and internet) as competitors (with a negative impact) to the formal educational systems;
5.</s>	<s i="34">What should be the role of the educational systems in reaching out to the communities (mainly parents and informal education);
6.</s>	<s i="35">What shall be the criteria for renewing textbooks; who is in charge of monitoring them, and at what frequency?</s>

<s i="36">Any peace process, even if just at the stage of a ceasefire, must recognize the role of those who stand at the forefront of society day in and day out--the educators.</s> <s i="37">The questions outlined above require strategic discussion, as well as policy decisions.</s> <s i="38">These cannot be taken only at the grassroots level.</s> <s i="39">If we demand of the educational system to work for the implementation of a peace agreement, including a detoxification of society from hate and animosity and an enhancing of skills for non-violent conflict resolution, it is necessary to provide the leaders of that system with the mandate to do so.</s>
