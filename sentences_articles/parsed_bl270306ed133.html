<s i="0">January 25 marked a fundamental transition in Palestinian politics.</s> <s i="1">It is a transition away from the old way of doing things toward a new direction not yet fully formed.</s>

<s i="2">It will take time for the new Hamas-led government to settle on a clear direction.</s> <s i="3">That direction is liable to be hugely influenced by the new set of pressures on Palestinians that Hamas' parliamentary election victory has created.</s>

<s i="4">Internally, pressures will arise from those not yet able to accept their defeat.</s> <s i="5">It is evident from the refusal of the PLO factions to cooperate with Hamas that there will be an ongoing contest for power in this new reality.</s>

<s i="6">This in turn necessitates a very careful and balanced approach from Hamas, forced as it is to shoulder the burden of governance on its own.</s> <s i="7">This internal power struggle will therefore be crucial in the formulation of the new Palestinian government's approach to many issues, whether social, economic or political.</s>

<s i="8">Externally, meanwhile, it is abundantly clear that the threats directed at Palestinians according to which they will pay the consequences should they lean toward Hamas in their vote will almost certainly be translated into practical measures.</s> <s i="9">Political isolation will become the norm rather than the exception.</s> <s i="10">Economic aid will be terminated or at best slowed down.</s> 

<s i="11">Meanwhile, the new Israeli government, most likely led by Kadima, will be encouraged to pursue its unilateral measures, and will now with greater emphasis claim there is &quot;no Palestinian partner for peace&quot; in order to secure international acceptance and recognition of that unilateral strategy.</s> 

<s i="12">In other words, Palestinian society will find itself under siege both internally and externally.</s> <s i="13">The response of Hamas will be crucial.</s> <s i="14">Hamas in government cannot remain the same as Hamas in opposition.</s> <s i="15">Previously, it was enough for the movement to raise the banner of resistance and thus avoid the many political and diplomatic issues that a government must deal with.</s> <s i="16">That is no longer an option.</s>

<s i="17">The first task for Hamas will be to allay Palestinian fears over the future.</s> <s i="18">A serious commitment to the democratic process and reform of the workings of the Palestinian Authority should thus be high on the agenda, while too much tinkering on the social level could be detrimental.</s> 

<s i="19">If Hamas, in spite of all the challenges, is able to cater to the needs of Palestinians and maintain services, then the movement will succeed in sustaining the level of its popularity.</s> <s i="20">However, if due to internal pressures and external isolation Hamas is unable to adapt, then a whole new set of questions and scenarios might arise.</s>

<s i="21">The secular movements will likely continue to weaken further as people become more rejectionist.</s> <s i="22">Further starvation and isolation of Palestinians might very well bring about more radicalization in their political tendencies.</s> <s i="23">This could open the way for new players to enter the Palestinian arena with full force.</s>
