<s i="0">Whenever Palestinians complain to the international community about the consolidation of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the response is invariably that this is an issue to be taken up after the Gaza withdrawal is completed.</s> <s i="1">In other words, the position of the international community, as represented by the Quartet members, on the unilateral Israeli disengagement plan is based on the assumption that this plan marks the beginning of the implementation of the Quartet's roadmap plan for peace.</s> <s i="2">This underlying hypothesis holds that the Israeli disengagement from Gaza and the evacuation of four small settlements in the northern West Bank will facilitate and lead to the resumption of negotiations toward a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</s> 

<s i="3">It is because of such optimism that the unilateral Israeli plan gained international support.</s> 

<s i="4">The signals emanating from Israel, however, are completely different.</s> <s i="5">In most of his statements on the aftermath of disengagement, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has been keen to &quot;assure&quot;</s> <s i="6">Israelis that the withdrawal from Gaza will not be followed by more withdrawals in the West Bank.</s> <s i="7">Even the small steps taken in the northern West Bank were reduced so that now Israel is talking about evacuating the four small settlements without changing the status of that area from Area C to B or A, which would leave them under Palestinian Authority control and responsibility as in Gaza.</s> 

<s i="8">Alas, this is not just about signals.</s> <s i="9">Israeli actions in the West Bank, including the expansion of settlements and the completion of the illegal wall, all clearly indicate that Israel has in mind another unilateral disengagement plan for the West Bank.</s> <s i="10">The combination of the accelerated settlement expansion program and the completion of the wall will leave what some people have started to call the autonomous Palestinian walled state.</s> <s i="11">In this &quot;state&quot;</s> <s i="12">Israel will have confined the vast majority of the Palestinian population to within the wall and within the closed area of Gaza, while the rest of the West Bank, almost half of it, will serve to accommodate the expansion of settlements and become contiguous territory to Israel.</s> 

<s i="13">Without a serious international effort to force Israel to move from a unilateral into a bilateral process and consequent negotiations based on the roadmap, the post unilateral Gaza disengagement plan might be followed by another in the West Bank.</s> <s i="14">Such unilateralism is not only not helpful to a peace process, it is antithetical.</s> <s i="15">Any attempt by Israel at imposing a solution will only cause frustration and anger and subsequently violence.</s>
