<s i="0">Syria and Iran do not interact with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the same way.</s> <s i="1">While there could be both advantages and disadvantages for Israel in prospective American-Iranian talks, there is a slim but nevertheless intriguing possibility that talks with Syria, by both the US and Israel, could produce a variety of positive benefits for Israel.</s> <s i="2">This is far less likely with Iran.</s> 

<s i="3">Because at the regional strategic level Israel appears to be headed on a collision course with both Syria and Iran, it behooves Jerusalem to exploit any opening for talks that might help avoid an open and devastating conflict.</s> <s i="4">Equally important, talking to Syria could conceivably have far-reaching consequences for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</s>

<s i="5">Broadly speaking, Iran's and Syria's self-appointed roles in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are to support the most extreme Palestinian movements that refuse to recognize Israel and reject a two-state solution.</s> <s i="6">Iran, indeed, itself rejects a two-state solution, and calls for the elimination of Israel.</s> <s i="7">But Syria does not, creating the impression that its support for Hamas has less to do with Islamist ideology than with Damascus' alliance with Tehran and its desire to hold a few trump cards for eventual negotiations with Israel.</s>

<s i="8">In another striking contrast between the two, Syria calls openly for peace negotiations with Israel, whereas Iran refuses to have any political or diplomatic contact with Israel.</s> <s i="9">In recent days the contrast has been particularly striking, with Iran hosting a Holocaust-denial conference while Syrian leaders entice Israel with offers of future joint ventures on the Golan.</s>

<s i="10">Syria is the odd-man out in the web of influence that Iran is weaving all the way to the Mediterranean.</s> <s i="11">The other members of the &quot;Shi'ite crescent&quot;--Iran itself, the new Iraqi ruling majority and Hizballah--are Shi'ite.</s> <s i="12">Syria is a Sunni-majority country ruled primarily by the Alawites, who have a tenuous historic relationship with Shi'ite Islam.</s>

<s i="13">Finally, Syria is weak militarily and economically and confronts problematic relationships on all of its borders: with Iraq (and the 140,000-strong US military force there), Turkey, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon.</s>

<s i="14">Taken together, these factors point to a number of possible advantages that Israel could now gain from successful negotiations with Syria--advantages that did not exist in the past.</s>

<s i="15">During the 1990s, no fewer than four Israeli prime ministers (Rabin, Peres, Netanyahu and Barak) negotiated with Syria.</s> <s i="16">They were prepared to give up more or less all of the Golan Heights in exchange for a cold peace that would presumably have involved a chance for peace with Lebanon and an ending of Syrian support for Hizballah and for the Palestinian &quot;rejectionist&quot; organizations that found shelter in Damascus.</s> <s i="17">The latter, at the time, were relatively incapable of challenging Fateh's primacy on the Palestinian political scene, while the Iran-Syria link was considered a relatively manageable problem from Israel's standpoint.</s> <s i="18">An added advantage of an Israeli-Syrian settlement was understood to be the weakening of the Palestinian negotiating position by virtue of the isolation engendered when Israel closed the circle of peace with all its Arab state neighbors.</s>

<s i="19">Today, the Iran-Syria-Hizballah-Hamas link is far stronger and more dangerous than in the past.</s> <s i="20">Successful negotiations with Syria would presumably yield not only a cold peace with Damascus, a chance for peace with Lebanon and isolation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but by severing the &quot;Shi'ite crescent&quot; link could also generate a radical weakening of Hamas in the Palestinian arena and at least partial removal of Iran from its current growing position of negative influence in the Levant.</s>

<s i="21">In other words negotiating with Syria, as the Baker-Hamilton report suggests, could if successful produce a host of benefits for Israel in the Palestinian and other spheres that were not nearly as relevant during the 1990s.</s> <s i="22">Note that this linkage--Syria first, then Palestine--is the reverse of that advocated indirectly by Baker-Hamilton and directly by so many Arab and many western actors, who insist that a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the key to everything else in the region falling into place.</s> <s i="23">It builds on the fact that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is in any case currently not ripe for a peace process.</s> 

<s i="24">Syria is aware of this enhanced payoff to a successful negotiating process with Israel (and with the US, which would seek Syrian commitments regarding Iraq and Lebanon).</s> <s i="25">In view of the American debacle in Iraq and Israel's difficulties in fighting Hizballah this past summer, Damascus will undoubtedly drive a hard bargain.</s> <s i="26">Indeed, there is no guarantee at all that the Assad regime with its mafia-like behavior and general lack of credibility is really a candidate for a viable agreement with Israel or the US.</s>
