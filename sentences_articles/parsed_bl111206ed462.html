<s i="0">Stating the painfully obvious, the Iraq Study Group report begins: &quot;The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating.&quot;</s> <s i="1">Judging from the 96 pages of assessment, alternative courses and 79 recommendations deriving from that opening sentence, it is really America's position in and throughout the Middle East, and not only Iraq's, that is at once both &quot;grave and deteriorating&quot;.</s>

<s i="2">We are all witnessing Iraq's descent into sectarianism and civil war.</s> <s i="3">National disintegration--not reconciliation or unification but partition--begins to assume an air of inevitability, in open defiance of America's presence or preferences.</s> <s i="4">Both before and after Baker-Hamilton, the US is powerless to either arrest the process or to determine its results.</s> 

<s i="5">Gone is any ambitious attempt at a concerted Greater or Broader Middle East Initiative.</s> <s i="6">In its place is an ill-disguised salvage operation, billed as &quot;the best strategies and tactics to positively influence the outcome in Iraq and the region&quot; and originating from within the US foreign policy establishment.</s> <s i="7">It is a pastiche of wishful thinking, conventional Washingtonian wisdom and desperate stop-gap measures patched together to mask both the embarrassing decline of American power and prestige and a sharp policy divide.</s> 
 
<s i="8">For America's well-wishers there can be no satisfaction--rather, if anything, profound discomfort--at watching a superpower in the deep throes of Middle East policy disarray.</s> <s i="9">This is particularly so for Israeli observers, given shared value systems and threat assessments and our direct regional proximity and appreciation for how the deterrent value of a strong, confident and determined United States factors into our own country's security posture.</s> 
  
<s i="10">Let there be no mistake.</s> <s i="11">The true import of the report has far-reaching implications beyond the confines of Iraq.</s> <s i="12">Globally, it puts paid to the so-called hegemonic or uni-polar interpretation of contemporary world affairs, revealing in so many words that the United States--tested and found wanting in Iraq, possessing the hard and soft power but not the will power--is unprepared and possibly ill-equipped to bear the full responsibilities of world order leadership.</s> 

<s i="13">In terms of the Middle East, the dual containment doctrine toward Iraq and Iran lies in ruins.</s> <s i="14">This power vacuum in the Persian Gulf owes to a combination of resolute and open Iranian defiance, Iraqi self-destruction and misplaced US priorities.</s> <s i="15">As a result, the Arab world's vulnerable southern tier--Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Arab emirates, Jordan, Lebanon, an ambivalent Syria and Palestinian moderates who are being swept aside by radical Islam--now lies exposed and insecure, bereft of the surety of a resolute United States acting from a position of strength.</s>

<s i="16">The blue ribbon commission, striving to put a positive face on an emerging foreign relations fiasco, calls for a &quot;change of course&quot; by launching a &quot;comprehensive New Diplomatic Offensive&quot; to deal with the problems &quot;of Iraq and of the region&quot;.</s> <s i="17">This in fact signals scarcely-veiled bipartisan dissent from the four central components that have constituted the Bush presidency's Middle East game plan: democratization as the overarching principle and highest priority; a united front against terrorism and abetting countries like Syria and Iran; unilateralist action, extending to demonstrations of military force and, where deemed necessary, preemption; and lower profiling of an Israeli-Palestinian conflict deemed unripe for resolution, decoupling it from other regional problems and downsizing the US role from indispensable to auxiliary.</s>

<s i="18">Yet what the report then proposes as a replacement for these fallen pillars is patently neither comprehensive nor new, foremost with respect to a depressing impasse in Israeli-Palestinian relations where the substitution default policy resurrects the notion of linkage.</s> <s i="19">&quot;Iraqis will have an opportunity for a better future, terrorism will be dealt a blow, stability will be enhanced in an important part of the world, and America's credibility, interests, and values will be protected&quot;.</s> <s i="20">How?</s> <s i="21">Only by the US dealing directly with the Arab-Israel conflict through &quot;a renewed and sustained commitment&quot; to &quot;a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace&quot;--on all issues, on all fronts and only within a wider regional context.</s>    

<s i="22">The conceptual as well as practical weaknesses in this line of reasoning are staggering, as are the attendant risks for all concerned parties.</s> <s i="23">Israelis, Palestinians, moderate Arab rulers and the US itself should carefully think through whether linkage, multilateral conference diplomacy and the quest for an omnibus solution, whether imposed or by consent, is really the best pathway to peace or even the desired quick fix as Baghdad continues to burn.</s> 

<s i="24">That the United States &quot;does its ally Israel no favors in avoiding direct involvement to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict&quot; is a debatable proposition at best.</s> <s i="25">Similarly, orchestration of the 1991 Madrid international conference by the US came on the wings of a stunning military-diplomatic triumph in forging a multinational coalition of the willing, all looking to Washington for leadership and sharing an interest in blocking a regional predator, Iraq's Saddam Hussein.</s> <s i="26">Then, America enjoyed great credibility and leeway, whereas for the foreseeable future the United States will be on the defensive.</s> <s i="27">Indeed, once having convened the talks it will be susceptible to demands from Arab delegations to press Israel for concessions, if only to avert yet another failed American enterprise.</s>

<s i="28">Moreover, embedded in recommendations 12 through 17 is the nagging suspicion that, if adopted by President Bush as policy, the United States will for all intents be rewarding intransigents: Iran, for helping foment instability; Hamas for its inflexibility; Syria for its duplicity; and the Saudis, the Egyptians and other Arabs for timidity and inaction while Iraq deconstructs and Iran, exporting its lethal brand of Islamic militancy, emerges as a regional superpower.</s>

<s i="29">There is folly in willfully associating the Palestinian question with what ails Iraq, tying an historical territorial dispute to an ancient tribal feud.</s> <s i="30">Each issue needs to be dealt with on its own merits, imaginatively, with extreme sensitivity and, whatever else, not by aggregating and thus compounding both problems as well as America's discomfort.</s>
 
<s i="31">Regionalizing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict contributes little if anything toward promoting the report's declared goals of supporting the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq, stopping destabilizing interventions by Iraq's neighbors, securing Iraq's borders, preventing the expansion of instability and conflict beyond those borders and promoting assistance for the Iraqi government from non-neighboring Muslim nations.</s>
