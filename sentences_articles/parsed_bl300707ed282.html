<s i="0">The young generation's quest for peace should begin with capitals &quot;D&quot; and &quot;C&quot;.</s> <s i="1">&quot;D&quot; for &quot;Don't repeat our parents' mistakes&quot;.</s> <s i="2">&quot;C&quot; for &quot;Creative, Constructive Cooperation&quot;.</s> <s i="3">The peace-quest alphabet would however be incomplete without &quot;I&quot; - for &quot;Identity&quot;: a key element we must take into account when discussing the young generation's role in ending the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</s>

<s i="4">Like most other conflicts, this one is based on two entirely contrary narratives: two entirely opposite ways of perceiving the conflict's past and present triggers.</s> <s i="5">Narratives of political conflicts seem harmless.</s> <s i="6">But when their perpetuation becomes an end in itself, peace becomes utopia.</s>

<s i="7">So what determines which collective narrative we believe in?</s> <s i="8">Identity!</s>

<s i="9">Political, religious and ideological identities are stronger than any rational argument, fact or emotion.</s> <s i="10">Rather, they shape arguments, facts and emotions so as to suit the opposing narratives of the conflict--regardless of the geo-political and historical context.</s>

<s i="11">In the best case, it is the political identity absorbed with regular socialization that determines which narrative we carry in our hearts.</s> <s i="12">Best case, because the substance and weight of this identity construct are given to change.</s> <s i="13">In the worst case, it is propaganda and incitement at an age and to an extent that cause irreversible hatred.</s> 

<s i="14">Too many Palestinian children--yes, here I point the finger--are incited and instrumentalized to perpetuate this conflict.</s> <s i="15">Half of the children from six to eleven dream of becoming suicide bombers!</s> <s i="16">Formal and informal education mechanisms openly teach these children an identity that is defined by enmity to Israel.</s> <s i="17">The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has turned into a vicious circle of destructive blame games, political dilettantism of decision-makers and propaganda, all fed by the power of the media, all instrumentalizing the power of political and ideological identities.</s>

<s i="18">The consequence for the young generation?</s> <s i="19">We must let go of dogmatized narratives and reframe the meaning of political identity within the larger and so much richer mosaic of sub-identities, of which we share so many.</s> <s i="20">We must create and concentrate on a superior, shared identity inspired by common interests: peaceful co-existence, democracy, freedom and economic development.</s> <s i="21">History shows it is possible when political will exists.</s> 

<s i="22">In 1910, a good German boy was he who hated the French, and vice versa.</s> <s i="23">Before this, there was the enemy-identification between France and England and before that, between England and Spain.</s> <s i="24">This enmity-image ruled in Europe for centuries--it ruled and broke Europe--again and again.</s> <s i="25">Historically, Europe is the example for disasters, but also for overcoming them.</s> <s i="26">TV snapshots say it all: Merkel hugs Blair, Blair hugs Sarkozy, Sarkozy-Zapatero - one big &quot;shmooze&quot;.</s>

<s i="27">Step one for the young generation to contribute to the peace process?</s> <s i="28">Respect and rebel!</s> <s i="29">Respect other identities, because the opposite of respect is identity imperialism, the unforgivable intention to impose one's own identity on others.</s> <s i="30">Always, this has led to war and misery, generation after generation.</s>

<s i="31">Rebel against hate propaganda and instrumentalization.</s> <s i="32">Information applied to brainwashing and for the formation of identity-imperialism must be recognized and denounced as an illegitimate weapon--like a landmine.</s>

<s i="33">This leads to step two: step out of the blame game.</s> <s i="34">Instead, young Israelis and Palestinians should each create internal mechanisms and infrastructures to unite moderate and peace-oriented young voices under a formal or informal, virtual or real entity.</s>

<s i="35">The third step is to open and push channels of dialogue between these two entities.</s> <s i="36">Here, as in the steps before, the young generation should use its big advantage vis-a-vis the &quot;old guard&quot;: the &quot;natural&quot; use of the internet.</s> <s i="37">The internet is an incredibly efficient platform for cooperation.</s> <s i="38">Young Palestinians and Israelis should turn it into an impact-rich tool to pressure and inspire decision-makers and foster and institutionalize constructive dialogue among decision-critics.</s>

<s i="39">Enough young, moderate voices are out there to make a significant change but they are not yet loud enough.</s> <s i="40">The internet is a powerful tool to turn up the volume and transform sound-bytes into action.</s> <s i="41">Think, for example, about the idea of a Palestinian-Israeli peace network: a culture- and civil society-oriented meeting point; an exchange of ideas, feelings, hopes, visions, transformed into actions through virtual conferences or informal meetings.</s> 

<s i="42">A young Israeli-Palestinian peace network embedded in a powerful pool of bloggers could open our path toward peaceful coexistence.</s> <s i="43">Sounds naive and simplistic?</s> <s i="44">Perhaps, but as a matter of fact, blogs today create opinions, and opinions shape policy-making.</s> <s i="45">Furthermore, without a small dose of naivete and an overdose of good will and optimism, we will make the same mistakes, cope with the same tragedies and live within the same vicious conflict as our parents, and so will our children.</s>
