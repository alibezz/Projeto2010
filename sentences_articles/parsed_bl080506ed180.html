<s i="0">The senior ministries in Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's new government are manned by people of relatively limited decision-making experience at the national security level.</s> <s i="1">The prime minister himself has always dealt with economic or municipal matters; Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni was catapulted to high office by Ariel Sharon; Minister of Defense Amir Peretz was a labor union leader.</s> <s i="2">Their detractors argue that they are not up to the heavy issues awaiting them; that a few seasoned ex-generals are needed.</s> <s i="3">Their supporters say it's about time &quot;ordinary people&quot; ran the country.</s>

<s i="4">What can we expect from them regarding Israeli-Palestinian issues?</s> <s i="5">Their declared agenda is &quot;convergence&quot;, meaning more disengagement.</s> <s i="6">Their immediate timetable is fairly clear.</s> <s i="7">Initially, in the coming two months, they will reach a maximum degree of coordination at the international level, first with US President George W. Bush, followed by the Europeans, Egypt and Jordan.</s> <s i="8">Then, they will launch a &quot;national dialogue&quot; in an attempt to galvanize public opinion behind an agreed Israel-Palestine border (agreed, that is, among most Israelis).</s> <s i="9">Then the government will legislate the convergence program, offer inducements to settlers to leave voluntarily, and begin building houses for the settlers who will be displaced.</s> <s i="10">All the while, it will complete the security fence as quickly as possible, along a path that defines the disengagement and improves the Palestinian situation in several sensitive areas, including East Jerusalem.</s>

<s i="11">Olmert and Livni face a challenge with regard to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen).</s> <s i="12">They don't want to negotiate with him.</s> <s i="13">They assess he lacks the necessary authority and leadership qualities, that his negotiating demands would preclude a successful outcome, and that in any event he would need Hamas government approval for any deal he strikes with Israel.</s> <s i="14">But Peretz does want to try another round of talks with Abu Mazen, and the US administration may agree with him.</s> <s i="15">In any case, Olmert and Livni will wait a few months just in case the Hamas government accepts the international conditions and agrees to negotiate on reasonable terms.</s> <s i="16">Washington may also insist that Olmert begin by dismantling those troublesome outposts that Sharon long ago committed to remove.</s> <s i="17">Here, then, are several reasons why Olmert may feel he needs two years to actually begin implementing convergence.</s>

<s i="18">All in all, there is precious little space for an active Palestinian role in Olmert's plans.</s> <s i="19">That is one reason why some Palestinians accuse him of planning an apartheid map.</s> <s i="20">Another is that Olmert's unilateral fence and settlement removal project do not go back to the green line.</s> <s i="21">These arguments are wrong-headed, and the world, including our neighbors Egypt and Jordan, should tell the Palestinians so.</s> <s i="22">They are wrong because the settlement blocs Olmert plans to hold onto are more or less within the parameters negotiated in 2000 between Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak; because the world will in any case not recognize Israel's unilaterally-delineated fence-border as a sovereign boundary; and because Olmert clearly describes the Israeli presence in the Jordan Valley as a security (not political) border.</s> <s i="23">This means the Palestinians get more territory, more contiguity and fewer settlers in return for nothing, without prejudicing final status borders in terms of international law, and at a time when they themselves are not capable of mounting a viable effort to negotiate a two-state solution.</s> 

<s i="24">Olmert, and Sharon before him, represent a post-Camp David II, post-intifada II Israeli approach to the conflict with the Palestinians.</s> <s i="25">It is based on conflict management rather than conflict resolution.</s> <s i="26">It seeks first and foremost to extract Israel from a demographic trap laid by the settlers and the Palestinians, each for their own reasons, and to create better conditions for dealing with Palestinian suicide bombings.</s> <s i="27">Palestinians can blame us for their situation, here and there convincingly.</s> <s i="28">But they had also better begin blaming themselves: it is they who have been launching the suicide bombers, who elected Hamas, and who still insist on the right of return and other conditions that preclude a genuine peace.</s>
