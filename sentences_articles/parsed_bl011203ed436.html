<s i="0">Common wisdom, sometimes laced with a degree of malice, has it that the US cannot do much to help the peace process along in an election year, let alone an election year as contentious and tense as 2004 promises to be: &quot;no president would antagonize American Jews by imposing a solution on Israel, when he is up for re-election.&quot;</s>

<s i="1">There is, of course--as in all effective distortions--a kernel of informative truth in this assertion.</s> <s i="2">No US president--in an election year, or any year--would gladly antagonize an active and highly committed and mobilized community.</s> <s i="3">Moreover, being attentive to the legitimate needs of Israel--for reasons which combine good strategic sense, a commonality of values, and shrewd political calculation--is by now &quot;as American as apple pie,&quot; and has been a mainstay of policy for every administration, at least since President John F. Kennedy first defined this as a special relationship.</s> <s i="4">After all, there is little left of the artificial lines separating foreign and domestic policy.</s> <s i="5">North Atlantic Treaty Organization expansion, policy on AIDS in Africa, relations with Mexico all have merit, but were also influenced by the support and active advocacy of important and pertinent American constituencies.</s>

<s i="6">And yet, this in itself is not the whole story, or even the most important factor.</s> <s i="7">Considerations related to &quot;the Jewish vote&quot; are neither the first nor the fourth reason why the US will not impose a solution:

1.</s>	<s i="8">To begin with, American policy in general--indeed, the basic concepts underlying the new &quot;industry&quot; of mediation, based on US practices--rejects the prospect of externally imposed solutions, which will always be, by definition, unpopular and brittle.</s> <s i="9">Experience has shown that a strong and stable outcome can only emerge if the two sides learn to listen to each other's needs, not steer them into a collision course with an external power.</s>
<s i="10">2.</s>	<s i="11">Moreover, in the specific Arab-Israel context, American administrations--ever since President Eisenhower came to regret the pressure on Prime Minister Ben Gurion to withdraw from Sinai without peace in 1957--have come to the conclusion that an overly intrusive role by the US makes peace less likely to happen.</s> <s i="12">Given the basic asymmetry of the situation, it tends to play up Arab expectations, and thus reduces the prospects for meaningful compromise.</s> <s i="13">Hence the famous statement by Secretary of State James Baker, back in 1989, that the US cannot want peace more than the sides themselves, and will not &quot;deliver&quot;</s> <s i="14">Israel.</s>  
<s i="15">3.</s>	<s i="16">Any US commitment to support some Palestinian aspiration, at the present time, must first be based on a Palestinian commitment--to decide which side they are on in the war on terrorism, and to act accordingly.</s> <s i="17">Until they do, they cannot appeal for a US role--and then complain bitterly that the president is openly calling for a new Palestinian leadership and refuses to do any further business with Yasser Arafat.</s>
<s i="18">4.</s>	<s i="19">Finally, the US will not be swept into a position in which it agrees to bypass the Israeli political process.</s> <s i="20">Respect for the outcome of a democratic vote is a profound American value.</s> 

<s i="21">American Jews love peace.</s> <s i="22">Every other synagogue, congregation or temple carries the term &quot;shalom&quot; in its name.</s> <s i="23">And yet for these four reasons, they stand guard against the temptation of choosing the option of American coercion--and will continue to do so in the future.</s> <s i="24">A great majority among them feels that coercion cannot serve as a &quot;shortcut&quot; to peace.</s> <s i="25">Today, as ever, they are able to influence policy only when the broad outlines of their positions fit comfortably with general American interests and values.</s> <s i="26">Thus, they will support and even demand some Israeli &quot;give&quot; on controversial questions, such as the settlements; but will always back Israel on security and identity issues, such as the fence, the &quot;right of return,&quot; and above all, the status of Jerusalem.</s> <s i="27">On all of these issues, they can expect their sensibilities to be in line with those of the majority of Americans, as represented by the US Congress.</s>
