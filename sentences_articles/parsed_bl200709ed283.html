<s i="0">In a recent speech in London, Javier Solana devoted special and rather innovative attention to the Middle East conflict.</s> <s i="1">This was not a message directed at us; rather, it was one dimension of a broader picture the European Union's chief foreign and security policy official painted for his superiors under the header, &quot;Europe's global role: what next steps?</s> <s i="2">[sic]&quot;</s>

<s i="3">This in itself is interesting and important: the Middle East, with our conflict at its center, is part of Europe's world view.</s> <s i="4">It is not merely a nuisance on Europe's eastern fringes, but a genuine threat to Europe and to its delicate relationship with its own component parts, its immigrants and its neighboring countries and peoples.</s> <s i="5">Our peace is their interest, and our wars are an immediate and continuous threat to their lives as well.</s>

<s i="6">This was not an anti-Israel speech.</s> <s i="7">It was one of the most original and courageous stands taken in recent years--in our favor.</s> <s i="8">Solana filled, in Europe's name, the job of responsible adult who enters the kids' room and tries to put a stop to the endless squabbling between its occupants.</s> 

<s i="9">Once, until not long ago, talk of two states for two peoples, one of them a Palestinian state, sounded like an optimistic vision: the right strategy waiting for the right timing; a kind of carrot awaiting the Palestinians at the end of the process if they fulfill all of Israel's demands and whims.</s> <s i="10">But times have changed beyond recognition.</s> <s i="11">The carrot has dried up and withered while the problems have grown to such an extent that it is doubtful whether the creation of a Palestinian state can deal with all the baggage created here during the years of arrogance, evasion, indifference and smugness.</s>

<s i="12">It sometimes appears to me that the days of the two-state solution are numbered.</s> <s i="13">The Israeli and Palestinian majorities that until lately provided the opportunity to end the conflict have been hijacked by fanatics driven by a very different vision.</s> 

<s i="14">Israel has fallen hostage to the settlers who believe in the vision of the greater land of Israel, meaning one state for the two peoples with structural supremacy for the Jewish component even at the cost of discrimination, an end to democracy and abandonment of the constitution of human rights that stood at the foundation of Israel's creation.</s> <s i="15">On the other side, Palestinian society has been hijacked by its own religious extremism that preaches the vision of greater Palestine under Shari'a law.</s> <s i="16">Both societies, ours and theirs, have developed a kind of &quot;Stockholm syndrome&quot; toward their captors: empathy and psychological identification with their kidnappers' deeds and values.</s>

<s i="17">Despite all their attempts and efforts, neither official Israel nor official Palestine appears to have the energy or capacity to free itself from the prison it has voluntarily locked itself in.</s> <s i="18">We are rapidly sliding down the slippery slope toward one entity between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean, all of whose component parts are linked by perpetual bloodshed in endless mutual hatred: a dialogue of national violence between two tortured peoples, fueled by religious fanaticism and dangerous messianic dreams.</s>

<s i="19">Hence the importance of the Solana initiative.</s> <s i="20">Apparently the picture Solana sees from &quot;there&quot; is one that Israel's leaders don't see from here.</s> <s i="21">One of the most significant developments in our contemporary world--one that is evolving before our eyes--is strategic deployment for global challenges.</s> <s i="22">Global warming, chronic shortages of water, energy, economic and business infrastructure, development of alternative energy resources and historic conflicts are no longer local problems.</s> <s i="23">Everything has a much broader significance--ramifications in depth and laterally that mandate the establishment of broad coalitions and new partnerships to deal with global tasks.</s> <s i="24">The Middle East no longer belongs only to us; we are not the only players in the arena.</s> <s i="25">Nuclear issues, terrorism, religious extremism and fanaticism are not our problems alone: their source may be here, but they project across the globe.</s>
