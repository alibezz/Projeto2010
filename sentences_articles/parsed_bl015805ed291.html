<s i="0">Whatever else happens after disengagement, an Israeli-Palestinian peace process is not likely.</s> <s i="1">Indeed, the period confronting us is one of great uncertainty, in which both the positive predictions of peace and the negative prognoses regarding large-scale violence have to be treated very skeptically.</s>

<s i="2">One reason for the uncertainty that is shared by both sides is politics.</s> <s i="3">Israel and Palestine are heading for national elections.</s> <s i="4">These will be the focus of public attention for the next six months, with another two or three months required to digest the results, form governments, and plan policies.</s>

<s i="5">Beyond this political timetable, there are plenty of additional variables to take into account.</s> 

<s i="6">We don't know whether Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) will succeed in maintaining PA/PLO rule in Gaza, or whether there will be chaos or rule by Hamas.</s> <s i="7">We don't know whether Palestinians will continue firing Qasam rockets and mortar rounds from Gaza--or will now begin firing them from the West Bank.</s> <s i="8">We don't know how well Hamas will do in Palestinian Legislative Council elections slated for January 2006, and what effect this will have on Palestinian policymaking regarding Israel.</s> <s i="9">If Abbas ceases to rule, we don't know who will replace him.</s>

<s i="10">On the Israeli side, we don't know whether PM Ariel Sharon will succeed in remaining at the head of the Likud, much less whether he will be the next prime minister.</s> <s i="11">If he remains in office, we don't know what sort of coalition he'll be able to form, and whether it will seek a peace process, another round of disengagement, or something else.</s> <s i="12">Lately he has been telling both sides of the Israeli political spectrum what they want to hear: to the right his message is that there will be no more unilateral disengagements and no negotiations unless all terrorism stops; the left hears him hinting that Israel will eventually leave both the West Bank mountain heartland and the Jordan Valley.</s> 

<s i="13">If someone else is prime minister of Israel, we may be better able to predict his course: Netanyahu will shun both disengagement and serious territorial concessions, but will allow himself to be dragged into a peace process due to weakness.</s> <s i="14">Peres will reopen final status negotiations.</s> <s i="15">Barak will initiate comprehensive disengagement.</s>

<s i="16">In Washington, we don't know what President Bush's Middle East agenda will look like nine months from now, though it is safe to assume that Iraq and Iran will still dominate it.</s> <s i="17">This renders highly unlikely a serious administration initiative to sponsor a new roadmap-based peace process, particularly one that entails confrontation between Washington and Jerusalem over the extent of territorial concessions.</s>

<s i="18">We do know that disengagement is good for Israel and Palestine.</s> <s i="19">It ends part of Israel's occupation of another people and serves its vital demographic needs, while it transfers land and a degree of sovereignty to the Palestinians.</s> <s i="20">Thus amidst the many uncertainties, it seems imperative to express a few hopes for the coming weeks:


	that the actual disengagement will go relatively smoothly and the accompanying internal Israeli controversy will do no permanent damage to the Israeli social and political fabric, which is essentially very resilient;
	that the Israeli public, which on the eve of disengagement continued to support the unilateral pullout by a solid majority--with a slim majority even expressing some readiness to countenance more such unilateral moves--will, post facto, continue to see this as a positive precedent;
	that the views of a majority of Palestinians, who consistently tell pollsters that they do not believe Israel is &quot;fleeing&quot;</s> <s i="21">Gaza due to military weakness, will prevail over the hotheads who cite the withdrawal as a Palestinian military victory to be emulated;
	that the international effort to mobilize the Gazan economy, spearheaded by the US, will reflect lessons drawn from past failures and register some success;
	and that Abu Mazen, who has thus far survived politically against considerable odds--and who favors a non-violent Palestinian effort to show that the PA can manage Gaza well and is therefore deserving of additional Israeli territorial concessions--will prevail over the terrorists, the extremists, and the bullies of lawlessness in Gaza.</s>




<s i="22">Finally, two closing, and troubling, thoughts.</s> <s i="23">In closing down the settlements in Gaza we encounter, up close, the folly of building them in the first place: the huge waste in resources and human suffering--including that of the departing settlers, which for many Jews is wrenching.</s>
