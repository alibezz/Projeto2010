<s i="0">As well as being a thorny and complicated issue, prisoners and detainees enjoy a special status in Palestinian society and consciousness.</s> <s i="1">Throughout the long years of occupation, more than a quarter of a million Palestinians have sampled the bitter experience of detention and arrest by the Israeli occupation army.</s> 

<s i="2">Today there are around 10,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons, including women and children.</s> <s i="3">The issue is a bleeding wound in Palestinian society, and since Oslo, Palestinian negotiators have failed to secure any clear criteria for the release of groups of Palestinian prisoners and detainees according to a set timetable.</s>

<s i="4">Instead, the Israeli government has maintained complete control over the issue.</s> <s i="5">Sweeping arrest campaigns are ongoing and Israel even wants the Palestinian Authority's security apparatuses to do the same.</s> <s i="6">When Israel has released detainees, it has done so according to its own criteria, and as a goodwill gesture rather then as part of a negotiations process.</s> <s i="7">In addition, the detainees Israel did release were usually people who had served most of their time, those who were arrested for marginal reasons or common criminals.</s> 

<s i="8">The core of the issue revolves around those arrested for resisting the occupation.</s> <s i="9">For them, Israel invented a new classification, &quot;those with blood on their hands&quot;.</s> <s i="10">These prisoners were excluded from any release process, even at the peak of detente in the political process.</s> <s i="11">As a result, the issue has remained a prime cause of concern to the Palestinian street and a source of embarrassment for the PA and Palestinian negotiators.</s> 

<s i="12">Palestinians have gradually learnt from experience that for any serious process to release detainees to happen it must involve an exchange.</s> <s i="13">This is what happened with the Popular Front/General Command and with Hizballah in the past when Israeli prisoners were released in exchange for Palestinian, Lebanese and Arab prisoners.</s> <s i="14">Hence, the Palestinian street is totally persuaded that any serious release of Palestinian prisoners requires capturing Israeli prisoners to exchange.</s> 

<s i="15">When Hamas entered the Palestinian Legislative Council elections, it ran on a program and performance different from what prevailed in the Palestinian arena.</s> <s i="16">Hamas' program is predicated on &quot;change and reform&quot; of the Palestinian track, especially in relation to the means of dealing with the Israeli occupation, whether as regards negotiations or prisoners.</s> <s i="17">A total siege was imposed on the government formed by Hamas, including an end to international financial assistance, when the government and Hamas refused to yield to Israeli demands that were also adopted by the international community.</s> 

<s i="18">Hamas found itself facing a serious crisis that threatened its ouster.</s> <s i="19">The movement tried to break the siege in various peaceful ways but failed, and the only option left was escalation.</s> <s i="20">Hamas sent signals that it would attempt to abduct Israeli soldiers, and, in cooperation with other Palestinian factions, succeeded in doing so in a unique operation against an Israeli military target.</s> 

<s i="21">The military wings of the factions involved considered the operation a change in the balance of power in their favor.</s> <s i="22">They honored the promise they made to the relatives of Palestinian prisoners in a manner different and more effective than the promises that have been made by Palestinian negotiators who have consistently failed in this mission.</s> 

<s i="23">The Palestinian side demanded a prisoner exchange deal, but Israel refused and instead launched an attack against the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.</s> <s i="24">Pressure started to come from the Israelis, as well as international and even Arab parties stressing the urgent need to resolve this crisis and release the Israeli soldier.</s> <s i="25">A proposal was floated to conduct a prisoner exchange that was staggered, whereby the Israeli prisoner of war would be released first and in exchange a number of Palestinian prisoners would be released at a later stage as a goodwill gesture toward Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who acted as mediator.</s> <s i="26">The number of Palestinian prisoners to be released was left unstated as was the kind of prisoners.</s> <s i="27">The date of release was not set.</s> <s i="28">The proposal was rejected by the Palestinian side and the Israeli aggression escalated in return.</s> 

<s i="29">When Hizballah captured another two Israeli soldiers, Palestinian morale, within the government, on the street as well as among prisoners and their relatives, was boosted.</s> <s i="30">Expectations that a deal would now be possible rose.</s> <s i="31">The experience of Hizballah added a practical dimension.</s> <s i="32">The message was that Palestinians were not alone and there is actual support from outside the borders that is more than simple statements of solidarity.</s> 

<s i="33">But Israel launched an open and insane war on Lebanon, encouraged by a US administration that found in the recent events a golden opportunity to forcefully rearrange the conditions in the region and settle scores with the &quot;evil&quot; axis that opposes its policies, including Iran, Syria, Hizballah and Hamas.</s> <s i="34">Fearing for their status and interests in the region, Arab countries came out very clearly against support of Hizballah, which was blamed for &quot;an adventure&quot; that could start a regional war.</s> 

<s i="35">As the military pressure increased on all of Lebanon and as political pressure mounted on Hizballah internally and externally, a Lebanese proposal came from Nabih Berri, the speaker of the Lebanese parliament and a close ally to Hizballah, which commissioned him to launch the initiative.</s> <s i="36">The offer was to conclude a deal for the release of the two Israeli soldiers in exchange for the release only of Lebanese prisoners as part of an integrated scheme to end the Lebanese-Israeli crisis.</s> 

<s i="37">This contradicted the expectations of all popular Palestinian parties, who were counting on the linkage between the Palestinian and Lebanese tracks, at least in relation to a prisoner exchange deal.</s> <s i="38">The Lebanese proposal did support the position of President Mahmoud Abbas, who from the beginning stressed the need to separate the tracks because the Palestinian situation is unique and different from the conditions in Lebanon.</s> <s i="39">Abbas has insisted on the necessity of releasing a number of Palestinian prisoners even if in a process that is staggered.</s> 

<s i="40">If the Lebanese position on separation between the Palestinian and Lebanese tracks on the prisoners file remains unchanged, and this appears likely, Palestinian hopes for a release of a significant number of Palestinian prisoners will fade quickly.</s> <s i="41">The only offer will be the initial one of a staggered exchange, and that, in turn, relies entirely on Israeli promises.</s>
