<s i="0">I continue to believe that a bilaterally negotiated two-state solution between Israel and the PLO is the optimal outcome and is possible.</s> <s i="1">But not under the leadership currently in power in all the relevant capitals: Jerusalem, Ramallah, Gaza, Cairo and last but not least (on the basis of its first 10 months' performance) Washington.</s> <s i="2">In the absence of credible hope for a near-term solution, a number of alternative paths to progress present themselves.</s> <s i="3">Two are reflected in evolving realities on the ground, hence appear to be the most pragmatic.</s> <s i="4">They are not mutually exclusive.</s>

<s i="5">One is Palestinian Authority PM Salam Fayyad's plan to create the institutions of statehood in the course of two years.</s> <s i="6">If, by August 2011 when those two years have elapsed, Israel and the PLO have not successfully negotiated a solution, the Palestinians would turn to the United Nations for recognition and third party international intervention.</s>

<s i="7">This is &quot;bottom up&quot; state-building that has proven itself thus far.</s> <s i="8">Fayyad, with international help, is successfully creating security, economic and governance institutions.</s> <s i="9">His efforts are not incompatible with those of Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu regarding &quot;economic peace&quot;.</s> <s i="10">They have already produced the best security situation in the West Bank in years.</s> <s i="11">There is something to work with here.</s> <s i="12">Besides, as of today this is the only constructive game in town.</s>

<s i="13">Obviously, to make Fayyad's scheme work, state-building must be paralleled, in real time, by serious negotiations.</s> <s i="14">If these negotiations are tried but, almost inevitably (like all their predecessors), fail due to lack of agreement regarding core final-status issues, then at least by August 2011 the international community will have something substantive to dig its teeth into: the makings of a Palestinian state on the ground, along with clearly defined gaps between the two sides' positions to be bridged through international intervention.</s> 

<s i="15">But Fayyad's scheme, along with other variations on unilateral or partial peace process themes being discussed today, applies to the Gaza Strip only in theory.</s> <s i="16">Assuming Egypt's prolonged efforts to bring about genuine Palestinian geographical and political unity continue to falter, any peace and/or state-building achievements emanating from Ramallah do not apply to Gaza and Hamas.</s> <s i="17">This brings us to the second non-bilateral process that can be characterized as an evolving reality: the existence of two separate Palestinian proto-state entities or, in political shorthand, the three-state solution.</s>

<s i="18">As matters stand, whatever Fayyad accomplishes and whatever Israel and the US contribute in parallel toward Palestinian state-building and Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation, this does not directly affect Hamas in Gaza.</s> <s i="19">The current international attitude toward Gaza can be characterized as non-benign neglect.</s> <s i="20">Israel, Egypt, the Quartet and the PLO all prefer to do nothing about Gaza in the blind hope that the reality of the Strip will either &quot;go away&quot; or at least not bother them too often.</s> <s i="21">The economic blockade continues; the military situation can be characterized as quiet for the time being, but only for the time being; all Arab parties pay lip service to non-existent Palestinian unity; and Egypt's mediation efforts are tailored to suit its own agenda of making sure Gaza remains Israel's problem, not Egypt's.

This situation will not last forever.</s> <s i="22">Anyone who hopes that success on the West Bank--economic, political, diplomatic or all of the above--will somehow bring Hamas rule in Gaza crashing down rather than inspire Hamas to invoke serious acts of sabotage--is gambling against the odds.</s>
