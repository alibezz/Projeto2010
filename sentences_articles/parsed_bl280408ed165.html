<s i="0">The controversy over the recent visit by former US president Jimmy Carter and the negotiations he ostensibly held with the heads of Hamas and the Syrian leadership can be divided into two aspects.</s> <s i="1">One is pragmatic and pseudo-diplomatic; the other involves the principle behind Carter's intervention and what it represents.</s>

<s i="2">Contacts and negotiations between Israel and the diverse actors of the Arab world have in recent years taken place against the backdrop of America's unwanted involvement in regional diplomacy.</s> <s i="3">The United States continues to provide strategic backing for the state of Israel.</s> <s i="4">And it leads the war against terrorism as well as the diplomatic and--in future--perhaps military effort against the Iranian nuclear program.</s> <s i="5">But in everything concerning the political processes likely to lead to agreements and perhaps even peace between Israel and the Palestinians or Syria, the Americans are not really wanted.</s>

<s i="6">There has now evolved an independent and fairly pragmatic regional framework for managing Israel-Arab relations.</s> <s i="7">There is an important Israeli-Palestinian track in Qatar; as concerns contacts with the Palestinians, whether Hamas or the PLO, Israel prefers Egypt's good offices.</s> <s i="8">To the north, Turkey is mediating with Syria.</s> <s i="9">It is into this system, which one day will generate a positive dynamic and agreements, that Carter has burst so crudely.</s> <s i="10">We can say confidently that he will fight against Israel to the last drop of Palestinian blood.</s> <s i="11">He is totally oblivious to the substance and depth of the Israeli-Palestinian tragedy of what is in fact a civil war.</s> <s i="12">He identifies Hamas, Syria's current leaders and Iran as anti-Israel and anti-US actors and in the name of peace and dialogue hastens to offer them legitimacy, thereby sabotaging the existing infrastructure of negotiations described above.</s>

<s i="13">Carter's behavior reminds us of the complaint of the dissidents advocating democracy in the Soviet Union at the peak of the cold war.</s> <s i="14">They argued against all those well-known intellectuals who legitimized the oppressive Soviet regime, praised it as the epitome of progress and, during the Vietnam War in the 1960s, demanded that the USSR join North Vietnam and the Vietcong in their war against the US.</s> <s i="15">Put differently, that was when Jean Paul Sartre and friends recommended world war III and instead got the Six-Day War.</s> 

<s i="16">Thus, real advocates of democracy and peace in Palestinian society, Lebanon and Syria cannot rejoice over the help that is ostensibly arriving in the person of the former American leader; indeed, they can feel betrayed by him.</s> <s i="17">Carter has over the years hastened to extend a hand, a friendly hug and the gift of legitimacy to every sorry dictator.</s> <s i="18">He made a pilgrimage to Fidel Castro in Havana and created the illusion of compromise and agreement over the nuclear issue vis-a-vis the communist dictatorship in Pyongyang.</s> <s i="19">Last week, he rounded off this humiliating performance in his contacts with Khaled Mishaal.</s>

<s i="20">These days, as the world becomes aware of the truth about the supposedly diplomatic solution reached with North Korea regarding its nuclear project, there is something symbolic in Carter's emergence at the geographic center of nuclear attention.</s> <s i="21">It turns out, according to the CIA's report to a US Senate committee, that North Korea deceived the West and effectively transferred its nuclear efforts to Syria.</s> <s i="22">That apparently explains the &quot;mysterious&quot; operation of September 6, 2007.</s> 

<s i="23">Carter's mediation efforts and, unfortunately, those of Egypt as well, must be understood in terms of Hamas' war strategy in Gaza.</s> <s i="24">The facts on the ground point to continuous attrition along the borders of the Strip, particularly focusing on the border crossings.</s> <s i="25">Some among us ask with astonishment why the Palestinians attack the very border passages through which moves the aid that sustains Palestinian society in Gaza.</s> <s i="26">This offers horrible testimony to the Somalization taking place there.</s> 

<s i="27">Those who suffer immediately are the Palestinians; Israel has no interest in this dire development whereby a terrorist revolutionary leadership is fighting by means of weapons of starvation and neglect of the population.</s> <s i="28">From Israel's standpoint, the war is about sovereignty and control on its border.</s>
