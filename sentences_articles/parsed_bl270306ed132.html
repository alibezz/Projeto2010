<s i="0">The election of Hamas has prompted an epidemic of self-induced amnesia among pundits who interpret Palestinian politics.</s> <s i="1">For years they argued that Israel should do everything to bolster Yasser Arafat, and later Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), lest Hamas gain ground.</s> <s i="2">Hamas would grow if Israel did not make far-reaching concessions, thus destroying any prospect of a negotiated peace.</s>

<s i="3">But now that Hamas has assumed power, these very same pundits ooze reassurances that Hamas is a partner for Israel after all.</s> <s i="4">True, it has yet to recognize Israel, renounce violence, or dismantle its clandestine &quot;military wing&quot;.</s> <s i="5">True, it declares openly that it will do none of those things.</s> <s i="6">But this is mere rhetoric, insist the pundits.</s> <s i="7">Now that Hamas is in power, it will have no choice but to accept Israel de facto.</s> 

<s i="8">The problem with this interpretation is not that it ignores the past history of Hamas.</s> <s i="9">The problem is that Hamas acquired power too easily.</s> <s i="10">It has never sat in opposition, joined a larger coalition, or acquired the habit of compromise.</s>

<s i="11">Hamas entered parliament with an absolute majority in its first election.</s> <s i="12">It has achieved, in 20 years, what the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has not achieved in 80 years.</s> <s i="13">Turkey's Islamists, regarded as the model of Islamist moderation, came to power only after decades of up-and-down parliamentary politics.</s>

<s i="14">Hamas, in contrast, has never experienced any period of across-the-board suppression.</s> <s i="15">Leaders of the movement were targeted by Israel, and some of its activists did time in Israeli prisons or were forced into exile.</s> <s i="16">But Hamas has been largely free to organize, publish, acquire arms and launch attacks.</s>

<s i="17">Islamist movements have been domesticated in strong states, where they have learned to interact with more powerful forces.</s> <s i="18">But in the West Bank and Gaza, Arafat preferred struggle to state-building.</s> <s i="19">Hamas accepted his nominal status as figurehead of the Palestinian cause, in return for almost complete freedom to do as it pleased.</s>

<s i="20">Not only has Hamas assumed power on its first try.</s> <s i="21">It has done so with its militia, its guns and its ideology intact.</s> <s i="22">Its speedy and sweeping ascent has simply validated its past militancy.</s> 

<s i="23">Now, late in the game, the United States, Israel and Europe seek to extract from Hamas those gestures of acquiescence Hamas would not make when it was weaker.</s> <s i="24">It is no surprise that Hamas evades them.</s> <s i="25">Like Hizballah, it believes itself to have forced an Israeli retreat.</s> <s i="26">It won a decisive electoral victory without parallel in the Arab world.</s> <s i="27">And Hamas is convinced it enjoys the sympathy of millions of Arabs and Muslims, prepared to extend unconditional moral and financial support.</s> <s i="28">Why should it bend?</s>

<s i="29">Hamas will devote its rule to achieving three goals.</s> <s i="30">First, it will seek to consolidate its grip over the institutions of the Palestinian quasi-state, at the expense of Fateh.</s> <s i="31">Second, it will move gradually to Islamize Palestinian life.</s> <s i="32">(Hamas will meet less resistance than secular observers think.</s> <s i="33">Last year, a poll showed that two-thirds of Palestinians believe Islamic law should be the sole source of legislation.)

Third, it will write its own &quot;roadmap&quot; in Palestinian consciousness, leading away from a two-state solution.</s> <s i="34">For that purpose, Hamas will make the media and the schools into extensions of the mosques.</s>

<s i="35">Hamas might continue the tahdiya, the informal &quot;hold-your-fire&quot;, if Israel executes more unilateral withdrawals.</s> <s i="36">But this process will slow or stop somewhere well short of the green line.</s> <s i="37">Then, if not earlier, Hamas is liable to open space for &quot;resistance&quot;--terror which, to its mind, is the only language Israel understands.</s> 

<s i="38">The Hamas concept of victory through &quot;resistance&quot; not only delegitimizes Israel's peace with Egypt and Jordan.</s> <s i="39">It undercuts the United States, which trades on its reputation as the only force that can deliver Israeli concessions.</s> <s i="40">Israel, the US, Egypt and Jordan thus have a vital interest in seeing Hamas fail.</s> <s i="41">So too does Europe, which has invested heavily in Palestinian civil society.</s>

<s i="42">To make Hamas fail, the Palestinian electorate must be made to realize that, tough as life has been, Hamas is making it worse.</s> <s i="43">If Hamas is allowed to feed the Palestinians both bread and illusions, the bread will sustain the illusions.</s> <s i="44">Only a regime of targeted economic sanctions can break the cycle.</s>

<s i="45">Palestinian pollsters tell us that Palestinian opinion largely favors negotiation with Israel.</s> <s i="46">Hamas thus needs the illusion of a &quot;peace process&quot; created by desultory contacts with foreign governments and mediators.</s> <s i="47">If Hamas is to fail, it must be denied any legitimacy for which it refuses to pay a price.</s> <s i="48">That requires an effective diplomatic blockade.</s>
