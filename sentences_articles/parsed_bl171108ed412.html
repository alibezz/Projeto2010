<s i="0">As is so often the case when the Palestinian issue is involved, it is impossible to view any one incident or dynamic in isolation.</s> <s i="1">A week or so ago, Hamas torpedoed the Egyptian-sponsored Palestinian unity talks by refusing to come to Cairo.</s> <s i="2">But Hamas also contributed in the past week to escalating violence between Gaza and Israel, possibly to distract attention from its anti-unity move.</s> <s i="3">And Hamas is seemingly gearing up for an official end to its ceasefire with Israel on December 19 and a declared end to the presidential term of Mahmoud Abbas on January 9.</s> <s i="4">In parallel, Israel's calculations regarding Hamas and Gaza are affected by all of the above as well as by the prospect of elections on February 10.</s>

<s i="5">These are, in outline form, the bare facts and dates.</s> <s i="6">The strategic reality runs deeper.</s> 

<s i="7">First and foremost, with the passage of time everyone--Israelis, Palestinians, Egyptians, the rest of the world--is growing accustomed to the existence of not one but two Palestinian political entities or mini-states, in Gaza and the West Bank.</s> <s i="8">Hamas cannot afford to openly support such a &quot;three-state solution&quot; lest it lose popular support.</s> <s i="9">But it also could not accept the conditions Egypt set forth as a basis for unity talks.</s> <s i="10">After all, those conditions bespoke a Gaza-West Bank reunification in which Hamas' grip on Gaza and over Palestinian security forces would have been weakened and Abbas' term of office extended.</s> 

<s i="11">On the other hand, Hamas leaders in Gaza presumably recognize that neither Egypt nor Israel--nor, for that matter, the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank--has developed a workable strategy for dealing with their militant Islamist mini-state.</s> <s i="12">This gives them a measure of flexibility in responding to events and external challenges.</s> 

<s i="13">Egypt restricts movement of people and goods between Gaza and Sinai and periodically cracks down on the border smuggling tunnels, just as it suppresses its own Muslim Brotherhood, the &quot;mother&quot; of Hamas.</s> <s i="14">Yet it also sponsors Hamas-Fateh reconciliation talks and Hamas-Israel prisoner-exchange talks.</s>

<s i="15">Israel consistently avoids entertaining the notion of an all-out military offensive to eliminate Hamas.</s> <s i="16">Yet it has no effective reply to Qassam and Grad rockets fired from Gaza.</s> <s i="17">It repeatedly falls back on collective economic sanctions against the Gaza population despite the total absence of evidence that this harsh violation of basic humanitarian standards substantively softens Hamas decision-making regarding the launching of violence against Israel or even its rejection of Israel's very existence.</s> <s i="18">And Israel's decision-making regarding Gaza is at least partially dictated by the fate of a single soldier, Gilad Shalit, in Hamas captivity.</s>

<s i="19">Anyone who thought the current ceasefire would solve some or all of these strategic quandaries was mistaken.</s> <s i="20">In both the Hamas and Israeli establishments there are powerful lobbies arguing that the &quot;tahdiyeh&quot; is a mistake.</s> <s i="21">Last week's flare-up of violence reflected each side's rejection of the other's ceasefire conditions and understandings, as December 19 inches ever nearer and both jockey for position.</s>

<s i="22">Thus Hamas' attitude toward the Cairo national reconciliation talks has far-reaching implications.</s> <s i="23">If the Hamas leadership changes its mind and goes to Cairo, this presumably reflects not only acceptance of Egypt's pro-PLO terms but also a readiness to extend the ceasefire on conditions acceptable to Israel.</s> <s i="24">If Hamas remains adamant in its refusal to discuss reconciliation along the terms proffered by Cairo with Arab League backing, then it is willingly entering into additional confrontation with Israel, Egypt and the PLO.</s>
