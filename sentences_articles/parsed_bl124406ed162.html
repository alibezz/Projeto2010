<s i="0">Israel confronts several options with regard to the Hamas Palestinian Authority government: seek to isolate it so that it cannot function and fails; actively seek to destroy it by military, economic or subversive means; deal with it minimally on a purely technical level; or negotiate with it directly or indirectly.</s> <s i="1">These are not all mutually exclusive, but they do represent quite different objectives.</s> <s i="2">The question is, which objective is in Israel's best interest?</s>

<s i="3">If Israel's interest is to reduce or eliminate the threat of terror and violence against it from the Palestinians, then creating greater suffering for the Palestinian population by seeking to destroy or further weaken the PA is hardly the option.</s> <s i="4">Rather, this would strengthen the Hamas government and legitimize an end of the hudna and greater violence.</s> 

<s i="5">If Israel's interest is to reduce or eliminate the violence against it, the objective must be to end the occupation and the conflict.</s> <s i="6">Parenthetically, taking down settlements, even in large numbers, will not end the occupation and certainly will not end the conflict--only an agreement regarding borders, refugees and security can do that.</s>  <s i="7">Clearly, such an agreement is not an easy task, and it may necessitate a series of agreements or interim steps.</s> <s i="8">But if those steps are not to be accompanied by violence, they too must be bilateral (Israel and the Palestinians, not Israel and itself or the US).</s>

<s i="9">How to do this when there is a PA government unwilling to speak with Israel?</s> <s i="10">One way is to resume negotiations with the president of the PA, Mahmoud Abbas.</s>  <s i="11">Officially and legally, Abbas does indeed represent the Palestinians, not only as chairman of the PLO but as the elected president of the authority.</s> <s i="12">Moreover, Hamas itself has allotted Abbas the task of dealing with Israel.</s> <s i="13">If and when an agreement is reached with Israel, the PA (Hamas), according to implicit if not explicit statements, would submit it to a referendum.</s> <s i="14">(Of course, if Israel had been willing to negotiate with Abbas before the Palestinian elections, Hamas might not be in power there today...) This is indeed one option, though admittedly a precarious one, for such talks might be de-legitimized at any time the Hamas government saw fit.</s>  <s i="15">Nonetheless, it is a door still open.</s>

<s i="16">Alternatively, there are a number of options for negotiating more directly with the Hamas government itself.</s> <s i="17">Much of our rhetoric today is reminiscent of the 1970s and 1980s with regard to talks with the PLO (&quot;they refuse to talk--understand only force;&quot;</s> <s i="18">&quot;they want to destroy us--viz., their charter;&quot;</s> <s i="19">&quot;nothing to talk about;&quot;</s> <s i="20">&quot;they are all alike--their so-called moderates represent no one;&quot;</s> <s i="21">&quot;their moderate words are only words&quot;).</s> <s i="22">And lest the religious nature of Hamas be seen to rule out any chance for pragmatism, let us not forget Israel's invocation of Arafat's references to &quot;jihad against the Zionist enemy...and for Jerusalem&quot;, not as a religious cause but certainly as one that seemed to brook no pragmatic compromise.</s>

<s i="23">If we have returned to the rhetoric of those days, let us return to some of the solutions from then.</s> <s i="24">There was the Shemtov/Yariv formula: the PLO has to &quot;recognize Israel's right to exist and abandon the use of terror&quot;.</s> <s i="25">Then, as now (Hamas too uses the old rhetoric), the response was that this puts the cart before the horse, demanding the fruits of negotiations before the negotiations themselves.</s> <s i="26">The PLO did finally decide to give priority to the political/diplomatic road over armed struggle, and in 1988 accepted the Shemtov/Yariv formula.</s> 

<s i="27">That pragmatic decision was brought about (as in many examples of conflict resolution) by a number of factors:1) domestic popular opinion (not at the height of Palestinian suffering but rather the height of resistance, the first intifada); 2) regional and global pressures, particularly the attitude of the US but also of most Arab states; and 3) indications that such a move would be worth doing, i.e., that it would elicit a positive response and in fact open the way to the end of occupation.</s> <s i="28">In sum, the locals wanted it, the outside community pressed for it, and there was the belief that Israel would make a deal (indicated unofficially by both American and Israeli representatives).</s>

<s i="29">The first two factors exist today.</s> <s i="30">Why not try to introduce the third: a declaration by Israel that it will, as before, speak with any representative of the Palestinians willing to negotiate with Israel.</s> <s i="31">This would imply both recognition and the preference for negotiations rather than bombs.</s> <s i="32">A mutual recognition of &quot;the right to exist&quot; such as occurred at the outset (not the end) of the Oslo talks would presumably suffice.</s> <s i="33">If this is too minimalist for Israel, negotiations might be opened in an international forum, based on mutual acceptance of UNSC Resolution 242--an old formula that might work once again--or the version updated by the Saudi Initiative/Arab League resolution.</s>
