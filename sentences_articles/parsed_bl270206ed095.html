<s i="0">Hamas has responded to international threats to withhold or end funding to the Palestinian Authority with a certain measure of calm.</s> <s i="1">There are several reasons for this.</s>


<s i="2">First is the question of principle.</s> <s i="3">Hamas is not ready to sell its political positions for money.</s> <s i="4">That is something the world should understand.</s> <s i="5">In the Palestinian case money cannot, and should not, be the first priority.</s> <s i="6">The cause of Palestine is first and foremost a political cause and not a case of alleviating poverty.</s>


<s i="7">Secondly, on a psychological level, Palestinians have lived under miserable conditions for a long time.</s> <s i="8">They have survived, grown stronger and more steadfast under these conditions.</s> <s i="9">Palestinians, as were evidenced by the recent elections, primarily want to see clean and efficient governance by a group of people dedicated to the interests, security and political aspirations of the people.</s> 


<s i="10">On a practical level, with or without funding, there is a lot of room for improving and streamlining the financial performance of the PA. An effective program to combat corruption and a serious review of financial policy should save millions.</s> <s i="11">There is much scope for improvement.</s> <s i="12">There are too many employees in the security sector and not enough in productive sectors.</s> 


<s i="13">Hamas will try to minimize expenditure and has already vowed to take lower salaries in high positions.</s> <s i="14">All ministries can bear expense cuts.</s> 


<s i="15">And there are other ways of redirecting money.</s> <s i="16">How many mosques are being built at the moment?</s> <s i="17">In the Gaza Strip, each mosque needs at least $200,000.</s> <s i="18">These mosques are built with money from private contributions and donations.</s> <s i="19">If people have trust in their government, if Hamas can convince people that they will use their money with probity, this money can go to other projects.</s> 


<s i="20">Do people trust Hamas with their money?</s> <s i="21">Recently, Hamas conducted a fund-raising campaign in the Gaza Strip and raised over $1 million there alone.</s> <s i="22">The answer, it would appear, is yes.</s>


<s i="23">In addition, there are promises of funding from non-western sources.</s> <s i="24">Muslim and Arab governments have vowed to support the new Palestinian government.</s> <s i="25">And while it may be true that some Arab governments are wary of Hamas and the ramifications of a successful Hamas-led government, there can be no doubt that the election of Hamas has proved widely popular among the peoples of the Muslim and Arab worlds, and all Muslim and Arab governments will be more wary of the feelings of their own people.</s> 


<s i="26">Still, should the West be adamant on cutting funding to the Palestinian Authority, it can seriously tighten the screw.</s> <s i="27">But tightening the screw will ultimately lead to the collapse of the PA and that, Hamas believes, is not in the West's interests.</s> <s i="28">It will harm the Palestinian people rather than Hamas.</s>


<s i="29">Look at the evidence.</s> <s i="30">People voted for Hamas in spite of it having been designated by the West as a terrorist organization.</s> <s i="31">People voted for Hamas even though Fateh warned it would affect salaries.</s> <s i="32">People voted for Hamas, because people trust Hamas and know Hamas.</s> <s i="33">They did so in spite of all the threats.</s> <s i="34">Should the PA collapse as a direct result of western pressure, there is no reason people will blame Hamas.</s> <s i="35">On the contrary, people will blame the West.</s>


<s i="36">From whatever sources, therefore, and whether directly or indirectly, Hamas is confident that funding will continue.</s> <s i="37">We can see this already.</s> <s i="38">The US says it will direct money through President Mahmoud Abbas.</s> <s i="39">Hamas has no problem with this.</s> <s i="40">Abu Mazen is the head of the PA and Hamas will not stand in his way, whether it is a matter of finance to help the Palestinian people or in his political pursuits.</s>
