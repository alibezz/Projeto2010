<s i="0">Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is maneuvering to establish a broader-based government in order to proceed with disengagement from the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="1">The alternatives to such a government appear to be either new elections or a right-religious coalition under Binyamin Netanyahu.</s> 

<s i="2">Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmad Qurei (Abu Ala) tendered his resignation against the backdrop of growing anarchy in the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="3">In the Palestinian case, there is no clear alternative to the present government--other than more anarchy.</s> 

<s i="4">The obvious connection between the two governmental crises is the advent of Sharon's disengagement plan.</s> <s i="5">In the Israeli case, Sharon's center-right coalition collapsed over the issue; his challenge is to put together a pro-disengagement coalition with a comfortable majority, despite the reservations of many in his own Likud party concerning both disengagement and the entry of the Labor party into the coalition.</s>

<s i="6">In the Palestinian case, the prospect of Israel's departure beginning in March 2005 has further destabilized an already chaotic situation in the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="7">Local power brokers there vie for control by means of violent demonstrations, abductions, and elections to Fatah branches.</s> <s i="8">The authority of Qurei and his superior, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, is being challenged and eroded.</s>

<s i="9">In a broader sense, Sharon is following in the footsteps of all his predecessors since the late 1980s--Shamir, Rabin/Peres, Netanyahu, and Barak--each of whom was eventually unable to remain in office because the Israeli-Palestinian conflict/peace process destabilized the coalition.</s> <s i="10">And while Qurei in his resignation statement did cite the economy alongside anarchy and the absence of a peace process as reasons for his intention to leave office, clearly in the Palestinian case too the cause is the conflict and its ramifications.</s>

<s i="11">In Israel, the split in public opinion over the Palestinian issue finds expression in an orderly parliamentary procedure that follows constitutional rules.</s> <s i="12">While that procedure is flawed and problematic and has thus far proven incapable of delivering on a peaceful resolution, it remains better than all the alternatives.</s> <s i="13">In this regard the greatest threat to disengagement is the intention of extremists among the ideological settler minority to bypass the democratic process, while the lesser threat is the built-in constraint within the Israeli system that allows a highly energized political minority like the settlers to delay or even disable the process.</s>

<s i="14">In contrast, Palestinians in their current dilemma have nothing by way of democratic precedent and little in terms of democratic practice to fall back on.</s> <s i="15">They have Arafat, and he is increasingly understood, even by them, to be part of the problem rather than the solution.</s> <s i="16">While some of Sharon's policies of the past three years have undoubtedly deliberately destabilized Palestine--Israel's prime minister seemingly does not believe in genuine peace with our Arab neighbors--at this juncture the Palestinians have only themselves to blame.</s> <s i="17">The dynamic in Gaza is liable increasingly to resemble Lebanon, or even Somalia; that would be disastrous for the entire region.</s>

<s i="18">One way or another, the interaction between Israeli-Palestinian peace and the functioning or malfunctioning of democracy in both countries could not be more obvious.</s> <s i="19">While the conventional wisdom of the Bush administration and many on the Israeli right holds that democracy--Palestinian, Iraqi--must precede peace and stability, this appears to be a luxury we in Israel are increasingly unable to afford.</s> <s i="20">On the contrary, Israeli-Palestinian peace, or even far-reaching unilateral separation initiated by Israel, could have the beneficial effect on Israeli democracy of finally removing or at least minimizing a divisive political issue that has been stymieing the system for nearly two decades.</s>

<s i="21">On the Palestinian side, the problems are more complex; there are no political precedents for linking greater democracy with peace, or vice versa.</s> <s i="22">There has been one democratic election, in January 1996, followed to a large extent by paralysis, corruption, and a culture of violence.</s> <s i="23">Now the mere threat of Israeli withdrawal has further exacerbated instability.</s>
