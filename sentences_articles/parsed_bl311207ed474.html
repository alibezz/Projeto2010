<s i="0">I built my home in the hills of the land of Binyamin: my homeland in the historic, national and personal sense.</s> <s i="1">I live in the pure and absolute belief that this is the only way my children and grandchildren and the children of all of Israel for generations to come can live in the Land of Israel.</s> <s i="2">Israel's declaration of independence is both a Zionist vision and a remarkably simple promise of survival: my people have no other place in which to live and develop.</s> 

<s i="3">The Arabs of the Land of Israel, if they so desire, have 22 countries and millions of square kilometers to which to move.</s> <s i="4">But I am ready to live with them; I want to know them, their culture and language.</s> <s i="5">I am prepared to reach an arrangement under which they receive personal residence rights, but never national rights.</s> <s i="6">I am not prepared to recognize them as a people, which they are not.</s>

<s i="7">To the credit of the Arabs of Israel, when they arrived in our barren land against our will they preserved the traditional names of Jewish settlements from before our exile: Maaleh Michmash/Muhmas, Geva Binyamin/Jaba, Harama/a-Ram, etc. Thus they kept the faith with the true owners of the Land of Israel.</s> <s i="8">As a son of the land returning home, I do not belittle the short history of the Arab residents in the area.</s> <s i="9">But nothing in this presence can detract from our absolute right to the land.</s> <s i="10">Against my will, I have become an enemy of the Arabs of Israel because that is how they chose to define me.</s> <s i="11">This is their choice, not mine: I never started a war with them.</s>

<s i="12">I am a settler, mitnahel: this is the term I have been ordained to use from the days of our Biblical fathers to the age of Zionism.</s> <s i="13">The construction of new settlements or &quot;outposts&quot; and the expansion of existing ones are first and foremost the realization of the divine command of inheriting the land and continuing to conquer the wilderness, an expression of Hebrew labor and the values of the renewal of Zionism, as well as a necessary humanitarian step for a population whose growth rate is among the highest in the land.</s> <s i="14">Maintaining and developing the settlement project is an existential requirement in terms of both values and security.</s>

<s i="15">What is an unauthorized outpost?</s> <s i="16">Migron, for example, is populated by some 350 people, with nursery schools and a developing, dynamic community most of whom live in structures that are government property and were brought there from 1999 in accordance with government and IDF instructions.</s> <s i="17">Construction was based on a development plan prepared by the Ministry of Housing.</s> <s i="18">The state of Israel linked Migron to electricity and water infrastructures and paved approach roads in clear recognition of the importance of settling the area.</s> <s i="19">The outpost is situated at a strategic point on route 60 on a rocky hilltop located 748 meters above sea level.</s> <s i="20">According to aerial photographs, prior to settlement this spot was completely free of agriculture and buildings and was not populated.</s> <s i="21">Based on these facts, can this be labeled an unauthorized location?</s> <s i="22">In whose eyes?</s> 

<s i="23">In American eyes.</s> <s i="24">US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, along with President George W. Bush, both of whom I'm sure don't know the names of many towns across the United States where tens of thousands of their own citizens live, know the name &quot;Migron&quot;.</s> <s i="25">Why?</s> <s i="26">Because they have no way to solve the Middle East problem and are committed to the American vision enshrined in the roadmap.</s> <s i="27">Yet the roadmap states that a basic condition is that the Arabs dismantle the terrorist infrastructure and that Hamas, too, cease violence and collect weaponry.</s> <s i="28">Has any of this happened?</s> <s i="29">Of course not.</s> <s i="30">Instead, what has happened is the unilateral expulsion, with American support of course, of some ten thousand innocent Jews from the Qatif Bloc in the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="31">The reader will judge whether this brought about the hoped-for peace or perhaps the end of violence.</s> 

<s i="32">Accordingly, the decree placing a total freeze on all construction in Judea and Samaria--needless to say, restricting Jewish construction only--including the cities of Ariel and Maaleh Adumim and the neighborhoods of Jerusalem, is an immoral, un-Zionist and inhuman step that will not withstand the test of reality.</s>

<s i="33">Not so long ago, there were different times: when ten 12-year olds from Ofra could bike alone through the streets of Jericho; when the mother of a third-grader from Ofra who broke his hand could hail an Arab taxi from Ramallah to a Jerusalem hospital, with no checkpoints or separation walls to stop them.</s> <s i="34">This was before peace &quot;broke out&quot; and the unfortunate Oslo accords delivered suffering upon us and the Arabs and destroyed the fabric of coexistence and peace that prevailed de facto between me and my Arab neighbors.</s> 

<s i="35">At the Saban seminar held in early November in Jerusalem, I was shocked to hear the prime minister of Israel analyze for the entire world the immediate need for the Annapolis Conference: &quot;Years ago, the Oslo Accords were signed.</s>  <s i="36">I was not among its [sic] supporters. . . .</s>  <s i="37">The opportunity that ripened then collapsed under the furor of terror, the lack of credibility of the Palestinian leadership at the time and the stormy disagreement in Israeli society. . . .</s> <s i="38">There was another chance developing in 2000--the special effort made by the State of Israel that reached its peak at the Camp David summit in July of that year.</s>  <s i="39">That meeting unfortunately ended with an explosion that led to the bloody intifada, which even today continues in the most sensitive areas of our lives.&quot;</s>

<s i="40">Then, amazingly, he concluded: &quot;Now is the time [for another conference].&quot;</s> 

<s i="41">Olmert continued: &quot;We do not ignore the weaknesses of the Palestinian leadership; we are completely aware of the failures of the Palestinian Authority--of the lack of stable governing mechanisms, of the total disintegration of the security mechanisms in Judea and Samaria, of the Hamas rule over the Palestinian parliament and of the violent control of the murderous organizations in the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="42">Their control allows for unceasing firing of Qassam missiles at residents in the south of the country&quot;.</s> 

<s i="43">Yet Olmert does not allow these facts to bother him as he proceeds along the same sad road of weakness, alienation from basic values, abandoning of parts of the homeland and endangerment of Israeli citizens to the point of a new bloodbath.</s> <s i="44">All this, in the hope of saving his skin from police investigations and enhancing his reputation with world opinion.</s>
