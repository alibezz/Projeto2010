<s i="0">US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's recent visit to Jerusalem and Ramallah was different from her eight previous trips to Israel and the PA in her current job.</s> <s i="1">This time, Rice announced a deeper American involvement in Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking, a notable departure from the erstwhile hands-off policy of the Bush administration.</s> <s i="2">Moreover, Rice appeared ready to explore new initiatives in Middle East diplomacy; she told her interlocutors that she intends to return every six weeks to baby-sit talks between Israeli PM Ehud Olmert and PA President Mahmoud Abbas.</s> <s i="3">Wrapping up her tour, the secretary spoke about a &quot;very positive development&quot; in opening informal talks between Abbas and Olmert, and once again pledged to &quot;do whatever I can do to try to help establish a Palestinian state&quot;.</s>

<s i="4">At face value, there are compelling reasons for the declared change in American policy and for Rice's optimism.</s> <s i="5">First and foremost, Israeli-Palestinian violence is at one of its lowest points since September 2000.</s> <s i="6">The shaky ceasefire in Gaza appears somehow to be holding despite ongoing Qassam rocket attacks into Israel.</s> <s i="7">Second, Olmert and Abbas are publicly committed to negotiating a two-state solution and share better personal chemistry than their predecessors.</s> 

<s i="8">Third, there is growing domestic pressure on Rice and the administration--from the media, from the new Democratic rulers of Congress and from the Baker-Hamilton commission--to shift gears on the peace process.</s> <s i="9">And fourth, aligning the moderate Arab regimes against the looming Iranian threat entails &quot;doing something&quot; on the Palestinian issue--a requirement understood by Israel.</s> <s i="10">Recognizing these developments, Rice argues that circumstances are better now for peacemaking than they were during the failed Camp David summit of 2000.</s>

<s i="11">Rice's high spirits notwithstanding, there is little she can hope for beyond helping to improve the regional atmosphere and laying the ground for future negotiations.</s> <s i="12">While important in and of themselves, these goals fall far short of a serious attempt to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</s> 

<s i="13">The main stumbling block for meaningful negotiations is the political weakness of the parties.</s> <s i="14">Olmert is the least popular leader in Israel in recent history and faces sharp criticism for the blunders of the second Lebanon war and criminal investigation for alleged corruption.</s> <s i="15">His stable coalition with right-winger Avigdor Lieberman keeps Olmert on the job, while tying his hands vis-a-vis the Palestinians.</s> <s i="16">Abbas' authority was devastatingly weakened by the success of Hamas in last year's elections.</s> <s i="17">Subsequently, Fateh and Hamas entered into an increasingly violent power struggle and exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal became the final arbiter on PA matters.</s> <s i="18">As a result, it is unrealistic to imagine either Olmert or Abbas making the necessary compromises to reach an agreement, let alone implementing one.</s> <s i="19">They have yet to conclude even a prisoner exchange deal, pending approval by Hamas.</s> 

<s i="20">Moreover, despite mutual declarations supporting the two-state solution, both sides have very different interpretations of the concept.</s> <s i="21">Olmert's suggestion of withdrawal to the security barrier line while delaying discussion about the future of Jerusalem and the refugees is way below the minimum acceptable to Palestinians.</s> <s i="22">Abbas opposes any interim deals and insists on negotiating final status.</s> <s i="23">This is anathema to the Israeli side, which fears touching the most sensitive issues.</s> 

<s i="24">Climbing down the rhetorical ladder, Rice made clear that negotiating final status is currently unrealistic.</s> <s i="25">Instead, she focused on removing a procedural stumbling block: Israel's insistence on adhering to the roadmap &quot;sequence&quot;, interpreted as putting negotiations on hold until the Palestinians eradicate terror.</s> <s i="26">Rice and Tzipi Livni, her Israeli counterpart, developed a plan for separating talk from action.</s> <s i="27">Let both sides draw the contours of the future Palestinian state, while holding off on implementation according to the roadmap phases.</s> <s i="28">Rice said she sold the idea to a reluctant Olmert, who had previously opposed it, as the basis for next month's trilateral Olmert-Abbas-Rice summit.</s>

<s i="29">To ordinary Israelis, these formulas seem like diplomatic blabber--something to let diplomats and foreign ministers chew on, but with little influence over or relevance to events on the ground.</s> <s i="30">As long as there is no credible military or political response to the rocket fire, a deep West Bank withdrawal--the ultimate precondition to any long-term settlement--is off the table.</s> 

<s i="31">Olmert and Abbas must recover from their political dilemmas if they are ever seriously to move forward.</s> <s i="32">Nevertheless, Rice's new effort may help them to prepare the ground for future negotiations, implement confidence-building measures and, most importantly, prevent another escalation.</s> <s i="33">Under American stewardship, it has been easier for Olmert to hold Israel's fire in Gaza, transfer withheld tax revenues to Abbas and call off a controversial settlement-building project beyond the barrier.</s> <s i="34">American help is also instrumental in keeping Abbas afloat.</s>
