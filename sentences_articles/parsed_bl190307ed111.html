<s i="0">The advent of a Palestinian unity government once again clouds the issue of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and contacts.</s> <s i="1">In reality, in considering the potential role of Hamas in preventing negotiations there are two categories of such talks to be discussed.</s>

<s i="2">According to the Oslo accords, any and all peace talks or even conflict-management negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians must involve the PLO, headed by Mahmoud Abbas, and not the Palestinian Authority in which Hamas has now welcomed Fateh as a partner.</s> <s i="3">In this regard, Israeli PM Ehud Olmert has been free to negotiate with Abbas over the past year and will continue to be able to negotiate without any direct Hamas-related constraints for the foreseeable future, or at least until Hamas actually becomes part of the PLO.</s> <s i="4">It is not at all clear why Olmert declared that the advent of the new government somehow reduces the potential scope of his talks with Abbas, when previously the government was composed only of Hamas.</s>

<s i="5">Logically, the fact that Abbas, as president of Palestine, now oversees a government in which Fateh has a stake in a power-sharing arrangement should make him more attractive to Israel as a negotiating partner.</s> <s i="6">After all Abbas, who is generally considered a weak and ineffective leader but a man of integrity, could now conceivably be able to &quot;deliver&quot; a little more effectively than previously, when Hamas constituted the entire government.</s> 

<s i="7">Then too, Abbas retains control over the National Security Council and has appointed Mohammad Dahlan his national security adviser.</s> <s i="8">This presents Israel with an attractive non-PA &quot;address&quot; for its security concerns.</s> <s i="9">Moreover, Saudi sponsorship of the agreement that produced this government ostensibly reflects an enhanced degree of Saudi influence over it--an additional factor mitigating in favor of exploring with Abbas the prospects for a viable political process.</s> 

<s i="10">So discussion of the possibility of negotiations with Hamas over a political settlement, which would almost certainly focus on the latter's proposals for a long-term hudna, or ceasefire, is theoretical until such time (and it may come within a year or two) as Hamas assumes the presidency of Palestine and the leadership of the PLO.</s> <s i="11">There remains, then, the question of &quot;dealing&quot;</s> <s i="12">(rather than negotiating) with the unity government now that it comprises Fateh as well as Hamas.</s> 

<s i="13">Israel has indicated it will refuse all contact, even with such respected figures and veteran negotiating partners as Finance Minister Salam Fayad and Foreign Minister Ziad Abu Amr.</s> <s i="14">After all, this new government has accepted none of Israel's and the Quartet's three conditions.</s> <s i="15">Indeed, the new government's guidelines endorse armed struggle or resistance as a &quot;legitimate right of the Palestinian people&quot;, ostensibly rejecting even the most easily negotiated of the three conditions, abandoning violence.</s> <s i="16">Needless to say, the Olmert government will not turn over tax revenues to Fayad (although it has already begun to do so with Abbas and could now continue in this path).</s>

<s i="17">In contrast, the international community, led by the Europeans and the United Nations, already appears to have rationalized the ethical and moral conflicts involved here and to have decided in favor of renewing contacts at least with the Fateh ministers and possibly with those from Hamas as well.</s> <s i="18">Some international financial support will now enter Palestinian coffers directly through Fayad's ministry.</s> <s i="19">The US position is not yet clear, but it's hard to imagine Washington refusing to talk to Fayad, whose rise to prominence under the late Yasser Arafat reflected a virtual American diktat.</s>

<s i="20">Indeed, it is equally hard to contemplate Olmert himself holding for long to his refusal to talk to the likes of Fayad and Abu Amr.</s> <s i="21">First, because Israel is liable to find itself isolated on this issue and subject to American pressure to show some flexibility.</s> <s i="22">Second, because Israel understands that the new unity government is the child of much-appreciated Saudi involvement.</s> <s i="23">As such, it is linked to the Arab peace plan that Israelis have begun to take seriously and by extension to the aspiration, however tenuous and divorced from inter-Arab realities, to make common cause with the moderate Sunni Arab states against Iran and its allies.</s> <s i="24">Third, because a much-desired prisoner exchange may require closer contacts.</s> <s i="25">And fourth, because Olmert's days as prime minister are almost certainly numbered and his successor will be free to ignore the taboos of yesterday and start with a clean slate.</s>

<s i="26">The Saudis, incidentally, point out that the new Palestinian government's guidelines also pledge to &quot;work to maintain the tahdi'a [pause, or ceasefire] and extend it&quot;.</s> <s i="27">As the Saudis understand the Mecca agreement that produced this government, they are in the process of successfully drawing Hamas into a commitment to a two-state solution and will make sure Hamas does indeed maintain and expand the ceasefire.</s>

<s i="28">In any case, Olmert or his successor would be well advised to reevaluate the three conditions, which were neither pragmatic nor historically justified to begin with.</s> <s i="29">Israel doesn't need Hamas' recognition to begin talking with it; close adherence to previous agreements, which is paid qualified lip service in the Mecca agreement and the new government's guidelines, has not been a characteristic of Abbas' administration or that of Arafat before him.</s> <s i="30">If the ceasefire can be maintained and expanded (a concept that must include cessation of smuggling of ordnance into Gaza) and a prisoner exchange implemented, this should qualify Hamas with Israel's guarded readiness to open contacts.</s>
