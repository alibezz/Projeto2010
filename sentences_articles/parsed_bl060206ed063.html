<s i="0">The response by the international community to Hamas' parliamentary election victory has unfortunately been hasty and unwise.</s> <s i="1">Before Hamas has even had a chance to form a government and clearly formulate policy, the international community has showered the party with demands and conditions for being deemed acceptable to even talk to.</s>

<s i="2">Essentially, Hamas was exposed to cheap blackmail from day one.</s> <s i="3">The movement was asked to do three things: recognize Israel, accept all previous agreements signed between the PA/PLO and Israel and denounce the armed resistance.</s>

<s i="4">In return, Hamas was expected to accept nothing other than continued development aid for a Palestinian Authority whose status is unclear and whose borders are fluid.</s> 

<s i="5">Two things need to be said here.</s> <s i="6">One is practical, the other political.</s>

<s i="7">On a practical level, it is not at all clear to Hamas that the international community's bluster is anything other than that.</s> <s i="8">The point has been made, but it bears repeating: withholding funding and aid to the PA will not harm Hamas, which has its own sources of funding, but will harm the Palestinian people.</s> 

<s i="9">What good will that do?</s> <s i="10">The Palestinian people have already made it clear that they are capable of defying the international community--after all they voted Hamas into power in the first place--and Palestinians do not trust the international community's intentions vis-a-vis the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</s> <s i="11">US backing for Israel is seen as one of the fundamental reasons for the failure of the peace process.</s> <s i="12">Should the international community, led by the US, stop funding the PA and thus punish ordinary Palestinians, Palestinians will blame not Hamas but the international community.</s> 

<s i="13">Further, there are alternative sources of funding.</s> <s i="14">Countries such as Iran have been suggested.</s> <s i="15">It is not clear that the international community, especially the EU, will want to see their primary source of political influence whither in favor of regional powers.</s> 

<s i="16">Then there is the political level.</s> <s i="17">Hamas' position is that the main problem in the last decade of negotiations with Israel has been that Palestinians have been asked to compromise and have gotten nothing in return.</s> <s i="18">That is the mistake Hamas will not repeat.</s> <s i="19">It wants to create a new dynamic.</s>

<s i="20">This is where the conditions of the international community come in.</s> <s i="21">If Hamas is to recognize Israel, will Israel recognize Palestine?</s> <s i="22">If Hamas is to honor previous signed agreements with the PA, will Israel?</s> <s i="23">And if Hamas is to end the armed resistance, will Israel end the belligerent military occupation?</s>

<s i="24">Without any answers to these three questions the position of Hamas is clear and has been voiced already.</s> <s i="25">There is nothing to talk about.</s> 

<s i="26">Hamas is not against a political compromise.</s> <s i="27">It is not against a state on the 1967 borders.</s> <s i="28">Israel, it is often said, is a de facto reality.</s> <s i="29">But so are Palestinian refugees.</s> <s i="30">There are 4.1 million registered Palestinian refugees in the Middle East.</s> <s i="31">These people cannot and should not be ignored.</s> 

<s i="32">Hamas wants a solution to all of these problems.</s> <s i="33">And it wants it in one package.</s> <s i="34">The previous agreements and negotiations between the PA/PLO and Israel have not led us any closer to a solution on any of these issues.</s> <s i="35">It should be obvious to even the most casual observer that rather than bring us closer to peace, the process based on stages has failed.</s> <s i="36">Israel has not lived up to its commitments under Oslo or under the so-called roadmap plan for peace, and has thus cancelled both.</s> <s i="37">It is time for a new approach to be tried.</s>
