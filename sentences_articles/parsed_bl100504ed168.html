<s i="0">Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's controversial proposal to &quot;unilaterally disengage&quot; from the Gaza Strip and the &quot;pay-off&quot; he was given for that package by United States President George W. Bush have stirred a great deal of debate in the region and throughout the world.</s> <s i="1">Unfortunately, many people have confused the Palestinians' reaction to these two events, which should be seen as separate, albeit related.</s> <s i="2">First of all, Sharon's purported plan was never really made clear enough for Palestinians to react to, and therefore was not taken seriously by the Palestinian side.</s> <s i="3">The letter of reassurances offered by the United States to Israel, on the other hand, was abundantly clear and viewed as damaging to the future of peace in the region.</s> 

<s i="4">Palestinians have always been suspicious of Sharon's real intentions.</s> <s i="5">When Sharon's letter to Bush was made public, those feelings were confirmed.</s> <s i="6">The reasons that Palestinians were fairly certain that the plan was a gimmick to lend legitimacy to Israel while extending Israel's illegal occupation, were first, that Sharon's plan would have kept Gaza under complete siege with the Israeli army controlling all entry and exit points and seaports and airports; second, that Israel was reserving the right to conduct any military operations in Gaza that it deemed necessary; and finally, that the Israeli military would remain stationed in some areas inside the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="7">That's pretty much the situation today, in fact.</s> <s i="8">Israel's army maintains a heavy armed presence outside Palestinian Authority governed population centers and then storms in at whim.</s>

<s i="9">Certainly, the promised evacuation of the Israeli settlements was a positive step, but it was a plum in an otherwise bitter pudding.</s> <s i="10">Gaza cannot stand on its feet alone economically.</s> <s i="11">Further, the plan would have altered Gaza's legal status, thus dividing it from the West Bank both in economic continuity and administratively.</s> <s i="12">Just to give an example, with the assumed change in legal arrangements, how might any kind of official registration been handled in order to span both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank as joint legal entities representing the future Palestinian state?</s> <s i="13">The likely chaos seemed to be a trap for the Palestinian Authority and its already disintegrating sovereignty.</s> 

<s i="14">A further reason for Palestinian suspicion was the intersection of this plan and the second stage of the roadmap, which calls for an &quot;interim&quot;</s> <s i="15">Palestinian state before a final status agreement on borders.</s> <s i="16">Palestinians have always feared that these temporary borders would become permanent by virtue of Israeli might.</s> <s i="17">Lest we forget, Sharon took office promising to arrive at a &quot;long-term interim solution&quot; with Palestinians.</s> <s i="18">According to his vision, Sharon believed that he could arrive at a truncated Palestinian entity (call it what you like) that would be comprised of all of Gaza and 40 percent of the West Bank, and thus bypass final status negotiations based on the 1967 borders that are rooted in international law.</s> 

<s i="19">All of this brings Palestinians to the conclusion that the ultimate objective of Sharon's strategy (including this plan) is intended to maintain the occupation and secure settlement expansion over two-thirds of the occupied territories, all the while preventing the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and consequently, the right to self-determination.</s> <s i="20">No less significant, they feel, is Sharon's goal of rendering Palestinian objectives impossible vis-a-vis basic final status issues, including the status of Jerusalem and the refugee right of return.</s>

<s i="21">Nevertheless, Palestinian officials did not reject outright the prospect of an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</s> <s i="22">They tried to make it clear to the outside world that without a coordinated handover and the necessary economic conditions for improvement and viability, including finding jobs for Gaza's 78,000 unemployed, the situation there was destined to remain explosive and a source of instability.</s> 

<s i="23">In sum, without major adjustments Sharon's plan cannot constitute a constructive step towards stability and peace building, but rather would contribute to deepening the conflict.</s> <s i="24">The international community must play the role of assuring a reasonable transition, one that will be a real end to the occupation rather than a &quot;withdrawal&quot;, and provide the Palestinian Authority with the necessary financial support for ensuring economic and political stability and control.</s>
