<s i="0">On both sides of the green line and, indeed, wherever people think about solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a lot of old/new thinking is taking place.</s> <s i="1">Old, because there is really nothing new under the sun when it comes to solutions for Israelis and Palestinians.</s> <s i="2">But new, because after 15 years of concentrated and largely fruitless efforts to solve the conflict with a negotiated two-state solution, we now encounter more and more discussion of alternatives.</s> 

<s i="3">Essentially, the dismal current status and future prospects of the Israeli-Palestinian two-state peace process are encouraging discussion among some Palestinians of reverting to the one-state solution championed by the PLO in its early years and by Hamas.</s> <s i="4">Meanwhile, among Israelis discouraged with the peace process, the Gaza-West Bank split is spurring consideration of solutions based on the existence of two Palestinian entities separated by Israel (in effect, a three-state solution) or of variations in which Israel and Jordan divide the West Bank and Israel and Egypt possibly deal jointly with the Gaza Strip.</s>

<s i="5">Most of these ideas are patently unrealistic.</s> <s i="6">Discussion of them often reflects despair, not pragmatic strategic thinking.</s>

<s i="7">Beginning with three-state solutions, it is difficult to assess how deep and long-lasting the Gaza/West Bank, Hamas/Fateh split really is.</s> <s i="8">Virtually all Palestinians insist that it has to end and that the two territories must eventually be rejoined, whether within a two-state solution or as part of a single bi-national state.</s> <s i="9">But a historical review of the course of Palestinian dispersal since 1948, including the 1948-1967 period during which Gaza was ruled by Egypt and the West Bank by Jordan, can only conclude that yet another phase of division and fragmentation is a possibility.</s> <s i="10">Here a lot depends on Hamas and militant Islam in general and the evolution of their approach toward the existence of Israel.</s> <s i="11">With its current extremist ideology toward Israel, Hamas can perhaps be tolerated in Gaza but certainly not in the West Bank.</s> <s i="12">This points to the possibility of Gaza emerging as a separate Palestinian entity within some sort of three-state or three-entity setup.</s>

<s i="13">Israeli variations on a three-state solution, championed primarily by settler ideologues and others on the right wing, are patently unrealistic insofar as they call upon Egypt and Jordan to relieve or lighten Israel's Palestinian &quot;burden&quot; by annexing, administering or enlarging (into Sinai) Palestinian territories.</s> <s i="14">Neither Cairo nor Amman has evinced the slightest readiness to comply.</s> <s i="15">Nor does Washington appear inclined--based on the wishful thinking of some Israeli right wingers--to somehow compel them to do so.</s> 

<s i="16">But Israeli right-wing wishful thinking pales compared to that of Palestinians who appear to believe that if they advocate a one-state solution it could somehow become a reality.</s> <s i="17">Put simply, the vast majority of Israeli Jews would not agree to live in a bi-national Israeli state.</s> <s i="18">Hypothetically, if for some cataclysmic reason they could no longer live in a Jewish, democratic state in their historic homeland, they would prefer renewed dispersion and Diaspora to life in a bi-national Arab-Jewish (essentially Muslim-Jewish) state that by definition would not be Zionist and would almost certainly quickly relegate Jews to the status of a persecuted minority.</s> <s i="19">Nor do Israelis intend to let that &quot;cataclysmic reason&quot; come to pass.</s>

<s i="20">Precisely because Palestinians who proffer a one-state solution do not have a Jewish negotiating partner, the threat to somehow revert to this position (most recently voiced by PLO chief peace negotiator Ahmed Qurei) unless Israel is more forthcoming in two-state solution negotiations is totally counter-productive.</s> <s i="21">Not only does it not soften the Israeli negotiating position--it generates indifference or even hostility.</s> <s i="22">In traditional &quot;stick and carrot&quot; terms, the Palestinians making this threat are beating themselves with their own stick.</s>

<s i="23">Perhaps most important for Israel and its supporters, failure of a two-state solution does not mean that the alternative is a one-state solution.</s> <s i="24">Precisely because there is no such alternative, other options more readily suggest themselves, ranging from temporary conflict management to three states or entities.</s> <s i="25">Nor does failure today mean that tomorrow we cannot try again to arrive at a two-state solution, which remains the best option for all.</s>
