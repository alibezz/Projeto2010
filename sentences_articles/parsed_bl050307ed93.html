<s i="0">The Palestinians argue that Israel is taking the deliberate and premeditated step of separating Judea and Samaria from the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="1">They list a number of primary reasons for this determination.</s>

<s i="2">Hamas, which rejects Israel's existence, has absolute majority support in Gaza.</s> <s i="3">In Judea and Samaria, on the other hand, Fateh, which is ostensibly committed to the Oslo agreements, holds the reins.</s> <s i="4">According to this logic, Israel is helping Fateh establish its rule because the latter, in order not to lose power at least in Judea and Samaria, will not press at this stage (an obvious Israeli interest) to link up the two parts of the designated Palestinian state.</s> <s i="5">In just a little while--Israel is alleged to be plotting--everyone will become accustomed to this new status quo, by which time it will be too late to unite Judea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="6">Thus will Israel also evade its commitment to open a passage between Gaza and Judea/Samaria.</s>

<s i="7">Yet another Arab allegation is that in Judea and Samaria Israel has allowed itself almost total freedom of military maneuver, whereas any military entry into Gaza is operationally problematic and politically complicated.</s>

<s i="8">Paradoxically, because all these accusations make perfect sense, and because a government dedicated to serving the interests of the public that elected it would follow precisely this policy, Israel is impelled to act otherwise.</s> <s i="9">After all, for some time now, particularly with regard to policy regarding the Palestinians, Israel has not behaved in accordance with orderly and calculated policies that give primacy to the interests of its citizenry.</s> <s i="10">After all, had there been governments in Jerusalem that assessed the situation in an orderly fashion, planned intelligently and then executed their plans, the devastating Oslo agreements would not have been launched; the panicky flight from Lebanon would not have taken place in May 2000; the war against terror, catalyzed by that flight, would not have lasted seven years and counting; and Jews would not have been expelled from the Qatif Bloc in Gaza.</s> 

<s i="11">Moreover, once Jews were expelled from Qatif and the Palestinians nevertheless continued to launch Qassam rockets at Sderot and the western Negev, Israel would have used the means at its disposal to overcome this form of terrorism.</s> <s i="12">Nor would the government have acquiesced in the massive smuggling of weaponry into the Strip under cover of a &quot;ceasefire&quot; that Hamas requested primarily in order to rebuild its forces and arm itself to the teeth.</s> <s i="13">Above and beyond everything else, Israel would not have deluded itself that the primary danger to the Zionist state's existence is the Iranian bomb and that consequently it can degrade its conventional army.</s> <s i="14">As a by-product of these delusions, Israel both suffered a painful defeat in the second Lebanon war and, as we have seen, failed to win the war at home against terrorism.</s>

<s i="15">Israel's inability to take steps that are important to its real national interests also influenced the timing, though not the substance, of the most dramatic development it has witnessed in recent times: the advent of the &quot;vision&quot; document composed by the elected leaders of the Palestinian citizens of Israel.</s> <s i="16">This paper, which constitutes a sort of declaration of divorce on the part of the Arabs in Israel from the Jewish state, does not surprise those who knew all along, but especially since the revolt of the Israeli Palestinians against the state in October 2000, that it was just a matter of time until the rupture surfaced.</s> <s i="17">Undoubtedly, though, the timing of the divorce was linked to Israel's inability to win the long war on terror and particularly to its unbelievable--in Arab eyes as well--failure to inflict a resounding defeat on Hizballah.</s>

<s i="18">Hence it can be argued that Israel's weakness has enabled not only more and more terrorism against it but also the chaos and short civil war within the Palestinian Authority.</s> <s i="19">A strong and determined Israel, acting in accordance with its existential interests, would long ago have put an end to Palestinian terrorism, i.e., to the very existence of terrorist organizations capable of hurting it.</s> <s i="20">In so doing it would have prevented the internal fighting within the PA and the rise to power of elements that oppose the very existence of a Jewish entity in the Middle East.</s>

<s i="21">Let's be honest with ourselves: since Israel failed in this struggle, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which are correctly seen as the primary parties responsible for Israel's failure to overcome the &quot;Palestinian resistance&quot;, have reached positions of influence and a capacity to sabotage, at least in the near term, any possibility of a settlement between Palestinian Arabs and Jews in this part of the world.</s>

<s i="22">Even the Mecca agreement, which has not yet been implemented only because of conflicts of interest within the PA, is a product of Israeli weakness.</s> <s i="23">Practically speaking, Mecca constitutes a retreat by the so-called moderates from their recognition of Israel.</s> <s i="24">Hence it memorializes on paper Hamas' victory on the battlefield.</s> <s i="25">This time the victory is over a faction of Fateh.</s> <s i="26">Had Israel acted in accordance with its interests it would from the start not have enabled Hamas to reach a position where it could defeat Fateh or attain genuine military capabilities.</s>

<s i="27">To summarize and return to the subject at hand: it is indeed in Israel's interest that Gaza be separated from Judea and Samaria, and that Gaza be linked to Egypt and not to Judea and Samaria by means of a corridor crossing Israeli territory.</s> <s i="28">Gaza would be Egypt's headache; Cairo would have to deal with political, economic, religious and military developments in the Strip.</s> <s i="29">Meanwhile, in areas A and B of Judea and Samaria, Israel could maintain its military rule as long as terrorism continues.</s>
