<s i="0">The 20 civilian deaths last week at Beit Hanoun constituted a tragic closing accord to an otherwise successful IDF operation against Palestinian terrorists.</s> <s i="1">And not for the first time: sophisticated military operations inevitably involve costly mistakes; sometimes we kill our own soldiers with &quot;friendly fire&quot;, sometimes enemy civilians with errant bombs, shells and bullets.</s> <s i="2">The resulting deaths are shocking, and decent people everywhere must deplore them and extend condolences to the bereaved, along with whatever aid the bereaved agree to accept.</s>

<s i="3">Yet precisely at this sad juncture, it behooves us to recall a simple but very important truth in Israel's conflict with the Palestinians--for that matter, with Hizballah as well.</s> <s i="4">Israel does not deliberately target enemy civilians; Palestinian and Lebanese terrorists do.</s> <s i="5">I realize that in the view of many Palestinians, Israeli civilians are &quot;soldiers&quot;, past and future, and the settlers in the territories colonialist thieves, hence fair game.</s> <s i="6">Undoubtedly, too, many Palestinians and others are convinced that the IDF devalues Palestinian lives and takes little care to avoid civilian casualties.</s> 

<s i="7">These views are typical of the third world liberation struggles of the past 50 years.</s> <s i="8">The Palestinians' insistence on presenting their struggle in this guise is politically and historically unacceptable to most Israelis and to many in the developed world, for whom there is an important difference here: there is no moral equivalency between the civilians killed deliberately by Palestinian terrorist groups and Hizballah and those killed unintentionally by Israel.</s>

<s i="9">Will the Beit Hanoun tragedy have any significant strategic consequences?</s> <s i="10">At the time of writing, last week's tragic events seemed rather surprisingly (since they strengthened Hamas' militant position) to have helped move Hamas toward a genuine compromise with President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen).</s> <s i="11">This is projected to produce, in a few weeks time, a new Palestinian unity government headed by a non-Hamas figure, one conceivably capable of persuading Israel and the Quartet that it has accepted their conditions for financial aid and political interaction.</s> <s i="12">But we have been at this optimistic juncture more than once in recent months, and there are plenty of reasons to believe that the unity government initiative will once again be scuttled by the internal Hamas leadership, or the external leadership, or Syria.</s>

<s i="13">The shocking global photo coverage from Beit Hanoun came at a bad time for Israeli PM Ehud Olmert, whose approval ratings are scraping bottom and who had hoped to arrive in better shape for his meeting in Washington with US President George W. Bush.</s> <s i="14">He compensated in recent days by generating spin about his readiness to make concessions to Abu Mazen: more troops and arms for loyal Fateh forces, reopening the Karni crossing, etc. Bush presumably will ask Olmert to find additional ways to strengthen Abbas and Olmert will agree.</s> <s i="15">If and when a new &quot;Hamas lite&quot;</s> <s i="16">Palestinian government is formed and prisoners are released, Olmert will meet with Abu Mazen and perhaps explore new ways of negotiating limited progress in the Israeli-Palestinian relationship.</s>

<s i="17">But Beit Hanoun will not generate any real breakthrough.</s> <s i="18">Nor, as long as Palestinian terrorism continues and Israel responds, will it be the last tragedy.</s> <s i="19">Neither Olmert nor Abbas nor Bush has the mandate, the authority or the leadership capacity to significantly reverse the present negative course of Israeli-Palestinian relations.</s> 

<s i="20">Moreover, and perhaps most important, both Olmert and Bush have weightier issues to deal with in the Middle East than Beit Hanoun and the Palestinian question.</s> <s i="21">Both are concerned about Iran and its sphere of influence: Syria and Hizballah.</s> <s i="22">And Bush has two years to work with a Democratic Congress and find a way out of Iraq.</s> <s i="23">The Palestinian issue is no longer the central focus of attention in the region that it was a few years ago.</s>
