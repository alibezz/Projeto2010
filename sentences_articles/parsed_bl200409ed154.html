<s i="0">Reconciliation between Hamas and Fateh is in the best interests of the Palestinian people and their national cause.</s> <s i="1">An agreement to end the current political divide and to form a unifying transitional government to rebuild Gaza and prepare for elections is our best hope.</s> <s i="2">The most likely outcome, however, is a protracted dialogue resembling the so-called &quot;peace process&quot; and improvised arrangements to manage the conflict between the factions and relieve the appalling situation in Gaza.</s> 

<s i="3">We can now expect to be captive spectators of a game in which players are obsessed with keeping the unity negotiations process alive rather than achieving its goals, a game designed to distract our attention from the factions' continued pursuit of power and self-interest.</s> <s i="4">This would leave the West Bank and Jerusalem to the tender mercies of Israel and condemn Gaza to a future as an underdeveloped state-like entity surrounded by powerful neighbors determined to keep it that way.</s>

<s i="5">The lack of significant progress on core issues at the Cairo talks indicates that the time is not ripe for a deal between Hamas and Fateh.</s> <s i="6">Indeed, the Egyptian proposal to form a coordination committee is clear evidence that Cairo has already given up on the notion of reconciliation in the near future.</s> <s i="7">Cairo is almost certainly correct in this assessment; reaching a deal requires compromise and concession, which neither side is ready for.</s> 

<s i="8">The way forward was clear in Cairo: Hamas needed to allow the formation of a cabinet that would receive the necessary regional and international backing to serve the Palestinian citizens in Gaza and the West Bank.</s> <s i="9">Fateh needed to agree on measures to incorporate Hamas into the PLO.</s> <s i="10">However, Hamas remains determined to hold on to the authority it has gained in Gaza and Fateh is clinging onto the power, resources and international legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority.</s>

<s i="11">The Egyptian proposal represents the first step toward the creation of arrangements to manage, rather than end, the factional divide.</s> <s i="12">The core objectives of these &quot;management arrangements&quot; will be to facilitate a resumption of the peace negotiations with a reluctant, rightist Israeli government and to allow the reconstruction of Gaza.</s> <s i="13">Designing arrangements that satisfy all key domestic, Israeli, regional and international stakeholders will be an extremely complicated exercise.</s> <s i="14">The issues of opening border crossings, prisoner exchanges, a tahdiyeh and the free flow of international aid will all come into play and the management arrangements will need to address them all as a package.</s>

<s i="15">In the event that suitable arrangements that deal with these four core issues can be cobbled together, Israel will almost certainly be required to turn a blind eye to the commencement of dialogue between the international community and Hamas.</s> <s i="16">Despite its previous implacable opposition to such dialogue, coupled with Israel's recent lurch to the right, the Israeli government may be willing to concede on this matter in pursuit of two strategic goals.</s> 

<s i="17">First, showing apparent flexibility at this stage will likely help keep relations with Washington and Brussels cordial and quell international community demands for explicit commitment to the roadmap and Annapolis.</s> <s i="18">Second, arrangements that merely manage the Hamas-Fateh split and postpone its resolution will allow Israel to deal with Gaza and the West Bank as separate entities and invoke the &quot;no partner&quot; excuse to postpone a peace agreement.</s> <s i="19">It also creates further diplomatic space and time for Israel to continue consolidating its control and settlement growth in the West Bank and Jerusalem.</s> <s i="20">This will require the international community to be convinced of Israel's good intentions and swallow disingenuous schemes akin to &quot;Gaza first&quot; or &quot;economic peace&quot;.</s> <s i="21">But this has worked before and it will almost certainly work again.</s>

<s i="22">Palestinian participation in the creation of such &quot;management arrangements&quot; may help alleviate the appalling humanitarian crisis in Gaza more quickly, though past experience of sieges and embargos imposed by Israel and the international community gives us just cause for skepticism.</s> <s i="23">However, the long-term costs of going down this path will be enormous if it leads to the creation of a quasi-state of Gaza, ruled by Hamas that accepts sovereignty over the Rafah crossing in return for a prolonged hudna and cessation of arms smuggling.</s> 

<s i="24">In such circumstances, Israel will be able to declare that its willingness to give the Palestinians sovereignty in Gaza is a clear illustration of its commitment to the creation of an independent Palestinian state.</s> <s i="25">Under the banner of &quot;Gaza first&quot; the Israelis would simply request that the international community give them more time to pursue &quot;economic peace&quot; until &quot;conditions are right&quot; to withdraw from the West Bank and East Jerusalem.</s> <s i="26">Then, with the passage of time and the continued consolidation of facts on the ground, Israel will persuade its international supporters that reunification of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza is impossible and that a West Bank-Jordanian confederation is the only practical way forward.</s> <s i="27">Meanwhile, Gaza will be destined to a future as a pariah state, perhaps with de jure sovereignty: a people whose day-to-day lives remain under the de facto control of its powerful neighbors.</s>
