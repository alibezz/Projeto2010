<s i="0">In looking at the likely status of the Arab-Israel conflict or diplomatic process during 2007, a key factor is the dramatic change taking place in Arab politics.</s> <s i="1">On a strategic level, there is the rise of a new alliance, which might be called the HISH powers (Hizballah, Iran, Syria and Hamas).</s> <s i="2">And on the ideological front, this bloc is accompanied by a new worldview, which can be called National Islamism.</s>

<s i="3">Until recently, the key battle within Arab politics was that between Arab nationalism and Islamism, with the former in power and the latter furnishing the main opposition movements.</s> <s i="4">Liberal democratic trends were a distant third.</s> <s i="5">Yet National Islamism is presenting itself as a synthesis between the two main warring sides, in theory able to mobilize the Arab masses.</s>

<s i="6">Briefly, National Islamism simultaneously bids to replace and incorporate nationalism.</s> <s i="7">The idea is that Islam is such a vital part of the Arab nation that the two cannot be separated.</s> <s i="8">The best way to defend the nation, runs the argument, is to accept an Islamist leadership.</s> <s i="9">Most obviously, Hamas seeks to lead the Palestinians and Hizballah to take over Lebanon--the latter demanding that all other political forces accept its rule as the most patriotic (despite its subservience to Iran and Syria).</s>

<s i="10">This new approach very much suits the interests of Syria and Iran.</s> <s i="11">For Syria, National Islamism lets it downplay the fact that the regime is dominated by a non-Muslim Alawite minority while winning support from the country's Sunni Muslim majority.</s> <s i="12">For Iran, this doctrine makes it possible to leap the Sunni/Shi'ite and Arab/Persian divide.</s>

<s i="13">A key element in National Islamism is for all Arabs (and Muslims) to unite in a struggle against Israel, the United States, and the West.</s> <s i="14">National Islamism demands total victory over Israel and rejects a negotiated compromise solution.</s> <s i="15">The summer 2006 Israel-Lebanon (or Israel-Hizballah) war is claimed as proof that the proper leadership and ideology can defeat and destroy Israel.</s>

<s i="16">The combination of HISH and National Islamism is responsible for the much harder line in the Arab world generally toward Israel than appeared to be the case a decade ago.</s> <s i="17">Its rise is still another factor bringing the chances for progress on resolving the conflict in 2007 close to zero.</s>

<s i="18">Beyond this, however, the picture is more hopeful in one very important respect.</s> <s i="19">The HISH/National Islamism combination poses a major threat to most Arab regimes, and especially Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the majority in Lebanon.</s> <s i="20">Because of their own ambitions, the HISH forces have gone out of their way to antagonize Arab governments.</s> <s i="21">To some extent, this is because they are trying to appeal to the Arab masses over the heads of their local rulers.</s> <s i="22">Yet that is all the more disturbing to less radical Arab states.</s>

<s i="23">Objectively, then, most Arab regimes have roughly parallel interests to those of Israel on the regional level.</s> <s i="24">They are especially not thrilled about Iran getting nuclear weapons.</s> <s i="25">This does not mean they will move closer to Israel or accept direct cooperation but it does indicate they are likely to want to avoid confrontation.</s> <s i="26">In a real sense, many in the Arab elites would like to see Israel and the United States cut the HISH forces down to size.</s> <s i="27">But they are unlikely to do much themselves toward that end.</s>

<s i="28">Another interesting factor is how this development plays with the Muslim Brotherhood groups.</s> <s i="29">The Syrian branch is against it, since that group wants to overthrow the Syrian regime and is angry at the Syrian rulers' ability to portray themselves as proper Islamists.</s> <s i="30">The Egyptian Brotherhood is also suspicious since it is hostile to Shi'ite Muslims.</s> <s i="31">The Jordanian Brotherhood, however, is enthusiastic.</s> <s i="32">Among the Saudis and the jihadis--including Osama bin Laden's followers--hostility to Shi'ites also makes them anti-HISH.</s>

<s i="33">Especially complex is the effect of these developments on Palestinian politics.</s> <s i="34">Hamas won the January 2006 Palestinian elections and has a strong base of support.</s> <s i="35">In many ways, the worldviews of Hamas and mainstream Fateh are not all that different except on the specific question of Islamization of society.</s> <s i="36">Yet institutionally the two groups are serious rivals.</s> <s i="37">Ironically, Fateh would be much more likely to accept National Islamism if it were in control.</s> <s i="38">But the prospect of a permanent shift in power to Hamas shocks and angers Fateh people to the point of violence, if largely due to the battle over power and patronage.</s>

<s i="39">This means that the differences between Hamas and Fateh are likely to prove irreconcilable, no matter how many meetings, quickly violated agreements or fast-evaporating truces they have.</s> <s i="40">In short, they will not be able either to unite against Israel or make any agreements with it.</s> <s i="41">And since both groups are trying to prove how militant they are--Mahmoud Abbas has little power even within Fateh--moderation is also not on the agenda.</s>
