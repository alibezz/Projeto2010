<s i="0">The government of Israel's unilateral plans should be of great concern to anyone still dreaming of some sort of agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</s> <s i="1">They should worry anyone concerned with the ongoing momentum of the radical Islamic wave.</s> <s i="2">And they should preoccupy anyone who understands that Israel must not allow itself to be perceived as having folded under the pressure of terrorism.</s>

<s i="3">Of course it behooves us to recall that the government's actions reflect the heavy disappointment felt by many Israelis as a result of the Oslo process, which was predicated on the assumption that there is someone ready to compromise on the Palestinian side.</s> <s i="4">Bitter experience has taught us that you cannot rely on the Palestinians, that no agreement is ever fully carried out by them, that Arafat was a terrorist incapable of evolving into the leader of an orderly state, that he was personally corrupt and that his followers plundered the Palestinian treasury and international aid money.</s> 

<s i="5">Ultimately, the Palestinians democratically elected a terrorist government.</s> <s i="6">No one compelled them to.</s> <s i="7">Now the naive Israelis who believed in them look forlornly and in shock upon a terrorist state.</s>

<s i="8">All these events generated a situation in which the government of Israel confronted two options, both bad.</s> <s i="9">The first would have been to maintain the status quo: to fight terrorism in Judea and Samaria relatively successfully, absorb the Qassam rocket attacks on Sderot and Ashkelon, pray that standard long-range katyushas with heavy payloads are not fired from the Gaza Strip, and hope the Palestinians get smart in the face of international pressure and that Hamas' power declines.</s> <s i="10">Then and only then would it be possible to try to advance in accordance with the roadmap, on the assumption that the Palestinians had elected a responsible non-terrorist leadership.</s>

<s i="11">The second option is the unilateral one.</s> <s i="12">In order to prevent terrorism and illegal immigration to its territory, Israel removes the settlements located to the east of the fence, strengthens the settlement blocs to the west of the fence, allows the Israel Defense Forces to operate freely to the east of the fence, as it does today, and does not permit a single Palestinian to enter its territory.</s> <s i="13">In the long term, the new line would be Israel's point of departure for negotiations, on the understanding that it satisfies the criteria laid down by President George W. Bush in his letter to PM Ariel Sharon, hence more or less constitutes the state of Israel's final eastern border.</s>

<s i="14">This line would constitute a heavy blow for Palestinians.</s> <s i="15">It would leave them less territory to control than what PM Ehud Barak offered them before the terrorism war, and would be easier for Israel to defend.</s> <s i="16">Moreover, completion of the fence, thereby preventing civilian passage across the line, would engender genuine difficulties in Palestinians' daily lives, in their economy and for those seeking to enter Israel illegally.</s> <s i="17">It would be harder to work in Israel, but also harder to carry out terrorist attacks.</s> <s i="18">In order to strike at Israel, Palestinians would have to develop in Judea and Samaria the rocket-firing capabilities that they have in Gaza.</s> <s i="19">But if the IDF can operate freely inside Palestinian territory this would be no easier than it is today.</s> 

<s i="20">Yet for Israel, too, unilateral withdrawal would be a serious blow: thousands of Jews would be expelled from their homes in return for nothing, in a step that advances neither a political settlement nor peace and quiet.</s> <s i="21">Indeed, the move would be perceived, like the withdrawal from Gaza, as yet another success for the terrorists and one more confirmation of Hizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah's argument that Israel is in the process of retreating in the face of continuing terrorism.</s> <s i="22">It would provide yet more wind in the sails of the terrorists.</s> 

<s i="23">Moreover, it is likely that the world, and particularly Europe, would not recognize Israel's line of withdrawal as a legitimate border for ending the conflict.</s> <s i="24">Accordingly, Israel would negotiate at some point in the future from a position of weakness, having foregone the territories it could have offered the Palestinians in return for peace--the strategic territories it now contemplates withdrawing from unilaterally.</s>

<s i="25">This analysis points to the only party to benefit from unilateral withdrawal: the terrorists, who would be able to wage their terrorist war from a stronger position and with high morale in view of their successes.</s> <s i="26">Ostensibly, then, the strong support for such a move in Israel is bereft of logic.</s> <s i="27">Yet, in the atmosphere of bitter disappointment with the Palestinians after Oslo, many decisions are being made in Israel out of despair.</s> <s i="28">The leading question is no longer what's good for Israel, but rather, what step would harm Israel the least.</s>
