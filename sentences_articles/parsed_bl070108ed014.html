<s i="0">Seven years after taking office, US President George W. Bush will visit Jerusalem and Ramallah for the first time to promote Israeli-Palestinian peace.</s> <s i="1">His stated goal is unpretentious: Bush seeks an agreement &quot;to define what a Palestinian state would look like&quot; by the end of 2008.</s> <s i="2">Implementation, however, will be contingent on fulfilling the terms of the roadmap, meaning that it will be deferred to the post-Bush era.</s> <s i="3">The other goal of this week's trip is to assuage the anxiety in Israel and the Gulf states over the recent American National Intelligence Estimate on Iran's nuclear program, which prompted fears in the region that the United States is leaving its allies to face Iran alone and bare-handed.</s>

<s i="4">Bush's modest plan for promoting the two-state solution is hardly exciting, but nevertheless, without his close stewardship even its meager goals will prove unattainable.</s> <s i="5">In the five weeks following their pledge to &quot;make every effort&quot; to conclude a deal, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have failed to move even an inch forward.</s> <s i="6">Once back from the American-orchestrated international event in Annapolis, both sides have quickly returned to their old habits of mudslinging and procrastination.</s> 

<s i="7">Olmert and Abbas may share personal chemistry and even similar views about the advantages of coexistence over conflict, but they lack either the public support or the political strength to overcome their respective obstacles.</s> <s i="8">Even the minuscule progress they have achieved so far was made possible only through Bush's intervention.</s> <s i="9">The president's decision to hold a peace conference, prodded by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, prodded Olmert to withdraw the Israeli refusal to discuss final-status issues before the roadmap's first-stage conditions are met.</s> <s i="10">The joint statement read in Annapolis was attained by aggressive American mediation, and only after any politically contentious language was edited out.</s>

<s i="11">Can Bush facilitate a deal, even on principle?</s> <s i="12">The answer depends on his political and personal stance, and on the situation on the ground.</s> <s i="13">Is Bush the omnipotent leader of the world, or an extremely unpopular lame duck marred by his failure in Iraq?</s> <s i="14">Apparently, he is a little of both.</s> <s i="15">His involvement is necessary but insufficient in itself.</s> <s i="16">Even Bush's more involved predecessor, Bill Clinton, lacked the ability to cut a deal during his last year in office.</s> <s i="17">An outgoing American president has more time to play foreign policy--after all, the domestic arena shifts to the election campaigns--but given his early expiration date, his efforts are extremely sensitive to foot-dragging by his interlocutors.</s> <s i="18">They can always bet on a better deal with a successor.</s> 

<s i="19">To his credit, Bush is aware of his limits.</s> <s i="20">In his pre-trip interviews to the Israeli media he pledged not to impose a deal, but merely offered his good offices to the parties.</s> <s i="21">&quot;I'm a known quantity,&quot; Bush said.</s>

<s i="22">The situation on the ground is hardly more promising.</s> <s i="23">The war of attrition in Gaza is heating up.</s> <s i="24">And while Bush has all but ignored that Hamas-controlled area in his public statements, the outcome of events in Gaza will have considerable influence on any Israeli-Palestinian deal.</s> <s i="25">Lacking a credible response to rocket fire, Israel will not withdraw from the West Bank's high terrain and turn its population centers and international airport into the next Sderot.</s> <s i="26">In the West Bank, Abbas has acted against Hamas but failed to rein in the militant elements of Fateh.</s> <s i="27">Security cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian authorities is at best half-hearted, and the IDF operates daily in Palestinian-supervised areas like Nablus.</s>

<s i="28">Olmert, whom Bush called &quot;a man of vision, a strong man, and my friend&quot;, looks to the presidential visit mainly as a tool in his political survival game, in anticipation of the Winograd report due on January 30.</s> <s i="29">While showing remarkable political skill in running the country, Olmert's performance vis-a-vis the Palestinians has been humble.</s> 

<s i="30">Facing strong opposition from Israel's defense organs, Olmert has failed to implement goodwill gestures to ease the economic hardships of the West Bank Palestinians.</s> <s i="31">His promises to remove illegal outposts, as mandated by the roadmap, are not taken seriously.</s> <s i="32">And only when Israel was caught red-handed in approving another housing project in Har Homa in the midst of negotiations did Olmert announce his intention to strengthen his personal oversight over settlement construction.</s> <s i="33">Clearly, the Israeli bureaucracy was oblivious to the new winds of peace.</s> <s i="34">And that's before the explosive issues like Jerusalem and refugees, which threaten to implode Olmert's coalition, were even discussed.</s>
