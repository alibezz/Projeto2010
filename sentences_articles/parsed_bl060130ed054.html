<s i="0">Hamas emerged the victorious party in the January 25, 2006 Palestinian elections.</s> <s i="1">This is bad news primarily for the Palestinians.</s> <s i="2">Israelis, their most immediate neighbors, have good reasons to be concerned as well.</s>

<s i="3">The Hamas electoral victory reflects a larger phenomenon in the Arab world--the growing estrangement of the masses from the current leaders, and the failure of the Arab states to modernize their countries and to bring prosperity to their people.</s> <s i="4">Concomitantly, fundamentalist Islamic organizations have filled the vacuum of governance by providing welfare services and by channeling the widespread frustrations toward greater religiosity.</s>  
  
<s i="5">Similarly, the surprising electoral outcome in the Palestinian Authority was primarily the result of the colossal failures of the ruling party, Fateh.</s> <s i="6">Given the opportunity of self-rule in 1993, the Fateh leadership established a corrupt, inefficient, lawless and authoritarian political system, which eventually degenerated into chaos and disorder.</s> <s i="7">The main failure of the Fateh-led PA was in the area most critical to state-building--monopoly over the use of force.</s>

<s i="8">In contrast, the Hamas leadership acquired popularity by providing welfare and education services to the people, and by establishing a reputation for honesty.</s> <s i="9">Moreover, the armed wing of Hamas has been at the forefront of the extremely popular terrorist campaign against Israel.</s> <s i="10">Yet it is questionable whether or not Hamas will be able to transcend Yasser Arafat's political legacy.</s>

<s i="11">The mere fact that the Palestinians could only choose between these two alternatives testifies to the depressing reality within Palestinian society.</s> <s i="12">It is a frustrated society, mesmerized by force, clearly displaying pathological dysfunctionalities.</s>
  
<s i="13">Unfortunately, however, Hamas is an unlikely candidate for reforming Palestinian society in a positive direction.</s> <s i="14">Essentially, Hamas represents a fundamentalist political force that regards modernity and western values as dangerous decadence and an affront to its version of Islam.</s> <s i="15">It is unlikely to serve as a modernizing agent by welcoming integration into a globalized economy, improving standards of education or allowing women equality.</s> <s i="16">Moreover, Hamas is not in any way committed to democracy.</s> <s i="17">The 2006 elections may well become the last free elections for some time to come.</s> <s i="18">If Hamas stays in power, it will establish a polity in the image of the Taliban regime, which is inimical to a Palestinian journey into modernity.</s> <s i="19">A Hamastan dooms the Palestinians to backwardness, poverty, and easy recruitment of fanatic terrorists.</s> 

<s i="20">While Hamas is capable of tactical flexibility, the expectation that it will become a moderate force in Palestinian politics is mere wishful thinking.</s> <s i="21">The role models for the Hamas leadership are Mahmoud Ahmedinezhad, the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hizballah in Lebanon.</s> <s i="22">Both, enemies of the West and its culture, have nourished relations with Hamas.</s>

<s i="23">The most important domestic challenge confronting Hamas is to impose law and order.</s> <s i="24">Yet it is not likely that the Fateh-linked militias will disarm in light of the election results and accept the new authority.</s> <s i="25">We have already witnessed the first violent reactions.</s> <s i="26">The struggle over control of the organs of force may well bring about bloody confrontations and even civil war.</s> 

<s i="27">This portends a political climate inhospitable to regular economic activity and growth.</s> <s i="28">Moreover, the PA is heavily dependent upon foreign aid and the recent political developments are likely to hinder transfer of aid by the international community.</s> 

<s i="29">For Israel, a Hamas-controlled PA primarily means the continuation of the conflict.</s> <s i="30">The growing influence of Hamas will inevitably harden Palestinian positions against Israel, making an agreement more difficult to reach.</s> <s i="31">Ideologically, Hamas opposes recognition of Israel.</s> <s i="32">It may decide on a truce, but the competition among the armed factions will assure the continuation of terrorist attacks.</s> <s i="33">Hamas will educate additional generations of Palestinians to regard Jews as those who stole their land and will attribute to them characteristics taken from the crudest anti-Semitic motifs.</s> <s i="34">The shaheed will continue to be the role model for Palestinian children.</s> <s i="35">These messages already form part of the consensus in Palestinian society.</s>

<s i="36">Israel's stance must be clear.</s> <s i="37">Jerusalem must demand recognition, cancellation of the Hamas covenant and cessation of all hostilities.</s> <s i="38">Terrorism must be dealt with harshly.</s> <s i="39">Moreover, the Hamas takeover constitutes an opportunity to establish reciprocity as the yardstick for Israeli policies.</s> <s i="40">Only good Palestinian behavior should warrant Israeli aid.</s> <s i="41">It is plain senseless to allow the transfer of funds, the supply of electricity, water, health services, and access to the Israeli labor market to neighbors who pray for Israel's demise.</s> <s i="42">The Palestinian people voted Hamas into power and they should bear the consequences.</s>
