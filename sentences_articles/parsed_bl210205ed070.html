<s i="0">From a Palestinian perspective, as well as from the perspective of international law, to distinguish between settlements and the settlements known as outposts is neither here nor there.</s> <s i="1">All of them--whether the large and long-established Ma'ale Adumim settlement bloc that tries to encircle Jerusalem and reaches down into the Jordan Valley almost splitting the West Bank in two, to any small caravan moved onto a hilltop overnight and to which the Israeli army winds up providing protection--are illegal, an obstruction to a peace based on two states, and a crime of the military occupation.</s>

<s i="2">International law as embodied by the Fourth Geneva Convention states quite clearly that it is forbidden for an occupying power to move, in whole or in part, its civilian population into occupied territory.</s> <s i="3">That law could have been written with Israel and its settlement policy in the West Bank and Gaza in mind.</s> <s i="4">It was of course written as a logical consequence of the most important axiom of international law: that it is forbidden for any state to acquire territory through military conquest.</s>

<s i="5">Nevertheless, on both a practical level and a political level, the outposts have become an issue separate from the overall settlement issue.</s> <s i="6">The Palestinian position on all settlements is constant.</s> <s i="7">On the Israeli side, however, the law that &quot;allows&quot;</s> <s i="8">Israel to build settlements in the occupied territories in the face of international law does not apply to settlement outposts.</s> <s i="9">In other words, even by Israeli law they are illegal.</s>

<s i="10">The outposts are also a direct transgression of the Sharon government's obligations to the US government.</s> <s i="11">Both domestically and diplomatically there would seem to be enough incentive as well as a legal framework to make the Israeli government force these outposts out.</s> 

<s i="12">On a practical level, too, the issue would appear to be one that can be addressed immediately.</s> <s i="13">Outposts consist of mobile trailers.</s> <s i="14">They can be placed quickly.</s> <s i="15">They can be removed quickly.</s> <s i="16">Furthermore, the Israeli army prides itself on preventing Palestinians from crossing the green line.</s> <s i="17">Logic would dictate that the army should be equally good at preventing Israelis from doing so too, thus re-establishing outposts as they have done the few times an Israeli government has made a half-hearted attempt at removing them.</s> <s i="18">Logic would dictate.</s>

<s i="19">But then logic would dictate that we ought to be talking about when settlements, all settlements, are removed, rather then if.</s> <s i="20">Logic would dictate that an Israeli government that professes itself in favor of a two-state solution would be acting swiftly and decisively against further settlement activities to prevent a situation in which a two-state solution is unfeasible, as is currently the case due to the existence of settlements and outposts.</s> 

<s i="21">Logic would dictate that at a time when there is a ceasefire, when we are supposed to be moving in the direction of peaceful negotiations to end the conflict, to create two states, the Israeli government would do all in its power to ensure that confidence is built between the two sides.</s> <s i="22">Logic would dictate that one of the most obvious confidence-building measures would be the removal of these settlement outposts as a first step to prove that, indeed, the Israeli government is interested in a viable agreement.</s> 

<s i="23">But that logic is a logic that aims at a peaceful end to the conflict.</s> <s i="24">The logic that wants to maintain and consolidate the occupation, the logic of war, says otherwise.</s> <s i="25">Settlement outposts and the settlers in them not only receive the protection of the Israeli army, they are afforded paved roads, electricity and water.</s> <s i="26">Few attempts have been made to remove them, and those few attempts have been thwarted by the immediate re-establishment of such outposts.</s>
