<s i="0">In spite of the intensive--and at times brutal--efforts of the Zionist movement and Jewish armed groups to force from Palestine the indigenous population, many Palestinians remained in their homeland after the establishment of the state of Israel.</s> <s i="1">For the first decade and a half after Israel was created, &quot;emergency regulations&quot; were used to lock these Palestinians inside their villages, prohibit them from moving through the country, deny them many jobs, and deprive them of basic rights and services.</s> <s i="2">The results of these policies were two-fold.</s> <s i="3">First, the population experienced a dramatic deterioration in standard of living and education, creating a dramatic gap between the human resources of the Jewish majority and the Palestinian minority.</s> <s i="4">Second, Palestinians in Israel were radicalized in their Arab and Palestinian identity, leading them to form Arab political parties and groups, which in turn prevented their dissolution and cultural absorption within the Jewish Israeli state.</s> 

<s i="5">The United Nations has criticized repeatedly Israeli government racial discrimination against the Palestinian minority.</s> <s i="6">The years that followed the Israeli occupation of the rest of Palestine, i.e. the Gaza Strip and the West Bank including East Jerusalem, witnessed the heightened politicization of this minority and its increasingly important role in Israeli politics.</s> <s i="7">Land Day represented the climax of these political activities.</s> <s i="8">On March 30, 1976, massive numbers of demonstrators protested Israel's confiscation of their land.</s> <s i="9">It is an event now commemorated annually, as a day to remind the Jewish majority and the government of Israel that the dream of a pure Jewish state is at best problematic.</s> <s i="10">Another sign of their increasing politicization is the voting behavior of Palestinian citizens of Israel, who are gradually moving away from voting for Zionist parties or for Palestinians affiliated with Zionist parties, to support Arab or non-Zionist Israeli parties.</s> 

<s i="11">Israel's treatment of Arab Israelis has always been one indicator of the attitudes of successive Israeli governments.</s> <s i="12">Even today, all studies expose a wide gap in all aspects of life between Palestinians and Jews in Israel, whether in the arena of education, health, infrastructure or even basic land ownership rights.</s> 

<s i="13">Too, Palestinian citizens of Israel have played an important and positive role in the dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians in general.</s> <s i="14">Many were instrumental in encouraging Israeli leaders to open relations with the PLO, and to pursue the peace process.</s> <s i="15">In addition, and as a result of being part of Israel, Arabs were able to help the Palestinians in the occupied territories in various ways.</s> <s i="16">They have always been active in various forms of solidarity against the occupation, in protesting oppression against Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and in uncovering the dangers of illegal Israeli activities.</s> <s i="17">For example, Israeli Arab activists have been instrumental in their solidarity and support for Palestinian prisoners.</s>

<s i="18">This phenomenon has made the state of Israel nervous, especially as its Palestinian citizens develop their political experience and increase in number.</s> <s i="19">Some Israelis have adopted the racist perspective that the borders of Israel and the future Palestinian state should be altered in such a way that will transfer most of these Palestinians from Israel into the Palestinian state.</s>
