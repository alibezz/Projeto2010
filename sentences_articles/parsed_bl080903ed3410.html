<s i="0">The Oslo agreements were not a coincidence of history.</s> <s i="1">In practical terms, the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships finally agreed that violence got them only deeper into trouble.</s> <s i="2">In political terms, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Chairman Yasir Arafat needed the legitimacy of a deal.</s> <s i="3">In conceptual terms, the Oslo agreements, signed in September 1993, had been conceived 15 years earlier, in September 1978, when Prime Minister Menahem Begin and President Anwar Sadat signed the Camp David accords.</s> 

<s i="4">After twelve years of political stagnation and the unleashing of a steadily growing vicious circle of violence, the concept of the Camp David accords was revived, and was put on the table in a moderate form during the second secret meeting held in Norway.</s>
<s i="5">At the first meeting, in January 1993, heading the very small Israeli team, I made it clear to my Palestinian interlocutors that Palestinian self-government in agreement with Israel would lead to a two-state solution, Israel beside Palestine, and Palestine beside Israel, both committed to good neighborly relations.</s> 

<s i="6">Following one hundred years of bitter conflict, none of us imagined that the way to peace would be easy.</s> <s i="7">We also understood that the two-stage concept defined in the Camp David accords of 1978 created two major problems: 

First, it was open-ended, i.e. the difficult issues of sovereignty over territories, borders, settlements, Jerusalem and refugees were all not dealt with and the search for a compromise solution was postponed, by agreement, to the next stage.</s> <s i="8">And secondly, the two-stage approach gave plenty of time for both sides� spoilers to get organized and to undermine the Oslo agreements.</s>
 
<s i="9">We knew all of this.</s> <s i="10">We also knew that the most logical way out, to go immediately to a single stage comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, was not doable; no preparatory work had been done and neither the Israeli nor the Palestinian leadership was yet willing to tell the public what the price for peace would be.</s> 

<s i="11">We thought that the way out would be to start immediately with the preparatory work and then move very fast from the first interim stage to a comprehensive peace agreement.</s> 
<s i="12">This work took 14 months, and was concluded at the end of October 1995.</s> <s i="13">Earlier the same month, Prime Minister Rabin announced in the Knesset that he wanted to conclude a comprehensive peace agreement with Arafat before the next elections, scheduled for October 1996.</s> <s i="14">Rabin informed President Clinton that he had chosen to move along the �Palestinian track�, and hence would not negotiate with Syria.</s> <s i="15">We also knew that by moving towards a two-state solution we destroyed ideological beliefs on both sides--the dreams of greater Israel and of greater Palestine.</s> <s i="16">Those who were committed to these dreams would not easily renounce them.</s> 

<s i="17">Today we are in a similar situation to that of 1978.</s> <s i="18">Then we had the Camp David Accords.</s> <s i="19">Today, we have the Clinton proposals, the roadmap and the Arab plan.</s> 

<s i="20">Failed negotiations can be of great historical relevance as they often produce concepts and ideas that do show the way for conflict resolution.</s> <s i="21">The Clinton proposals suggested the restitution of 97 percent of the territories of the West Bank and Gaza occupied in 1967, a comprehensive plan to deal with the Palestinian refugee issue and the division of Jerusalem into a Jewish and a Palestinian city.</s> 

<s i="22">The roadmap, issued almost two years later and supported by the US government, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations, devised a three-stage plan to get there.</s> <s i="23">First, end violence and create stabilization; second, establish a Palestinian state with provisional borders; and third, go for a comprehensive peace deal.</s> 

<s i="24">In spring 2002 in Beirut, an Arab summit conference agreed on a complementary plan that could actually lead the way to peace between Israel and all 22 Arab states, in the event that the roadmap and the Clinton proposals were put into practice.</s> 

<s i="25">At the moment, every side still fears that the other side is out to trick it.</s> <s i="26">Yet on the Israeli side, most of the taboos preventing a permanent status agreement have been broken.</s> <s i="27">The PLO has been recognized, the majority of Israelis supports the two-state solution, the partition of Jerusalem is no longer a taboo, and the understanding on territorial arrangements is that they will have to be based on the June 4, 1967 line with equal exchange of territories.</s> 
<s i="28">It is not certain that the taboos have been broken on the Palestinian side.</s> <s i="29">In order to reach a deal, the Palestinian side will have to recognize that the Jewish people has the right to exercise its right of self-determination in Israel.</s> <s i="30">Regarding the refugee issue, in the common search for a fair and just resolution, both sides will have to recognize that the right of return of the Palestinian people is to their homeland the State of Palestine whereas the right of return of the Jewish people is to their homeland the State of Israel.</s>

<s i="31">Any student of history knows that the moment when both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples have conceptually agreed on the guidelines of a peace agreement, getting there will only be a question of time and political architecture.</s>

<s i="32">In my view, we should all agree that the time has come to redouble our effort and get there as soon as possible.</s>
