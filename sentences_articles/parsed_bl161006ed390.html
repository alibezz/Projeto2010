<s i="0">The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has led directly or indirectly to the collapse of every Israeli government for at least the past 18 years.</s> <s i="1">Prime ministers Rabin, Peres, Netanyahu and Barak all failed to convert their popular mandate regarding the Palestinian issue into a viable coalition for change; some took dramatic but abortive steps, such as Oslo and Camp David II; all failed to last through their statutory terms of office.</s> <s i="2">Most recently, three different governments under PM Ariel Sharon were dissolved over the Palestinian issue, finally ushering in elections that brought Ehud Olmert to power on a platform that focused, once again, on ways to mitigate the conflict.</s>

<s i="3">In the course of this period, one attempt to improve the political structure--direct election of the prime minister--had to be abandoned because it merely worsened the situation, while the overall quality of Israeli politics and politicians has deteriorated sharply.</s> 

<s i="4">Israel's country-wide proportional voting system and heterogeneous society produce complex and fragile governing coalitions whose members are driven by diverse and often conflicting political agendas.</s> <s i="5">Small, radical factions often gain disproportionate power.</s> <s i="6">As a result the Israeli political system, far from providing a mechanism for solving Israel's conflict with the Palestinians, seems to have become a serious obstacle to a solution.</s>

<s i="7">Of course, the Palestinian conflict is not prolonged merely because of Israeli governmental instability; there are many other factors.</s> <s i="8">Nor can we ignore the chicken-and-egg question: does an inherently unstable form of government in Israel contribute to not solving the conflict, or does the conflict destabilize Israeli governments?</s> <s i="9">This is a particularly relevant issue today, with new initiatives surfacing to reform Israel's system of governance.</s>

<s i="10">On the Palestinian side the issue is not as clear-cut, if only because the Palestinian Authority is young and there has not been enough experience at governance to divine a clear link between the conflict and governmental instability.</s> <s i="11">Many Palestinians are inclined to blame all their troubles, including bad governance, on Israel and the conflict.</s> <s i="12">But the Israel factor does not appear to be the principal reason for the endemic corruption that affects Palestinian governance, or for the total failure to exploit the fruits--land, unhindered movement, hothouses and other infrastructure--of Israel's withdrawal a year ago from the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="13">One can even make the case that Hamas' rise to power through democratic elections reflected the Palestinian public's reaction to corruption and its adherence to the Islamist wave that is sweeping the Arab Middle East far more than a Palestinian response to the conflict.</s>

<s i="14">Still, it is hard not to perceive some sort of linkage between the conflict and governmental instability on both sides.</s> <s i="15">If we imagine for a moment that the conflict has been resolved in the form of a stable two-state solution, reinforced by improved Israeli relations with additional neighbors, international support and Palestinian economic growth, it certainly seems likely that the removal of this issue from the majority public agenda in Israel and Palestine might make their respective national agendas easier to manage and encourage greater stability in governance.</s>

<s i="16">Yet we are nowhere near such a solution.</s> <s i="17">Indeed, at present the most we can expect is an improved attempt at conflict management and growing international involvement, rather than conflict resolution.</s> <s i="18">Moreover, on the Israeli side the looming Iranian threat is likely to move the center of gravity to Israel's east (Iran, a Shi'ite Iraq) and north (Lebanon, Syria) and away from Palestine.</s> 

<s i="19">This poses an intriguing set of possibilities.</s> <s i="20">If, on the Israeli side, the need to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is pushed to the fringes of the public agenda and the conflict focuses primarily on Iran and its client states and proxies, might we have more stable governments based on a greater degree of national consensus, as we did when, prior to the 1980s, the Israel-Arab conflict loomed far larger than the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation?</s>

<s i="21">On the other hand, if on the Palestinian side hopes for a resolution to the conflict have, for the foreseeable future, been dashed, will the conflict have an even greater and more destructive effect on governmental stability?</s>
