<s i="0">Dear Members of the Quartet,

Let me tell you about our West Bank village of Jayyus.</s> <s i="1">By last July, we knew that Israel had already mapped out the course of the separation wall in Qalqilya District, but we had not yet seen the plans.</s> <s i="2">Then one September evening, a shepherd found white sheets of paper tacked to the olive trees.</s> <s i="3">He brought them to me, and I saw that they were military orders handwritten in Arabic.</s> <s i="4">The order said that all of the farmers of Jayyus village were to come to their farms, where a military officer from the nearby settlement of Qadumim would show us the path of the wall.</s> <s i="5">We thought that the Israeli military might confiscate 50 or 100 square meters--no more.</s> <s i="6">But 200 farmers showed up that unbelievable day to hear that the wall would be built six kilometers inside the Green Line, what we consider the political border with Israel.</s> <s i="7">Many of the farmers were weeping.</s>

<s i="8">I have worked all my life to build my farm, which stretches over 192 dunams.</s> <s i="9">My orchards are full of loquats and avocados, mangos and peaches, walnuts and figs.</s> <s i="10">I have the richest land in Jayyus.</s> 

<s i="11">But that Wednesday, I learned that 175 dunams of my land, the best and well-irrigated earth, was to fall on the other side of the separation wall.</s> <s i="12">To get to it, I would have to circumvent barbed wire, electronic censors, military patrols and an eight-meter high cement barrier.</s> <s i="13">Without those resources, I knew I would be a beggar.</s>

<s i="14">And so we began our peaceful demonstrations.</s> <s i="15">With international supporters, we farmers sat in the path of the bulldozers to try to prevent the uprooting of our olive trees.</s> <s i="16">Many Israelis from the peace camp and Jews from America and Europe came, too.</s> <s i="17">One day, we were sitting in the road when an Israeli army officer came and asked us why.</s> <s i="18">We told him that it would be better for them to kill us than to uproot our olive trees.</s> 

<s i="19">�We are constructing the separation wall to prevent attacks between Israelis and Palestinians and--in the end--for peace,� he replied.</s>

<s i="20">I said to him politely, �I represent Jayyus village.</s> <s i="21">I am ready to pay half of the cost of constructing this wall, if you would only build it on the Green Line.</s> <s i="22">If you have no security now, how do you expect to get it when you are 28 meters from our homes?� He became very angry, and said, �I want to show you something.� He put his arm on my neck and then under my shoulders, as if to whisper in my ear, but I could feel his arm wrenching painfully against my neck bones.</s>

<s i="23">This land was my father�s land and that of his father before him.</s> <s i="24">We have already lost land to the settlement of Zofin, which was established in 1988.</s> <s i="25">The dust from a nearby Israeli quarry--also a settlement--collects on the leaves of my fruit trees.</s> <s i="26">But it is only because of the earth�s wealth that I have been able to educate all of my seven children.</s> <s i="27">I have four daughters: one economist, two English literature majors and a third who will graduate in physics.</s> <s i="28">My sons include an electrical engineer, a lawyer and an agricultural engineer.</s> <s i="29">This last son, Muhammad, breaks my heart.</s> <s i="30">He won honors in school and a scholarship to study medicine in Tunisia.</s> <s i="31">But when Muhammad called me from abroad, I spoke to him of my sadness that none of my children would care for my farm.</s> <s i="32">He quit his program and returned to the West Bank to study agriculture.</s> <s i="33">Now we will lose our farm and I wonder every day, what gift have I given my son?</s> 

<s i="34">The bulldozers work on the wall 24 hours a day.</s> <s i="35">Israeli patrols run incessantly past our home and we do not sleep for the noise.</s> <s i="36">The village of Jayyus is home to 550 families, 400 of which depend entirely on agriculture.</s> <s i="37">Often, when we go to work the land, the military stops us to ask for our identification papers.</s> <s i="38">Israel says that we will continue to have access to our farms, but no one really knows what the future holds.</s> <s i="39">North of Tulkarem, the farmers were told this, too, but to this day they are barred from their farms.</s> <s i="40">I have advised all of the Jayyus farmers to live on their land, because if that is lost, we will have nothing.</s>

<s i="41">During the Aqaba summit, the Land Defense Committee of Qalqilya came to Ramallah and set up a tent in front of the office of Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas.</s> <s i="42">We established this tent because we wanted the world to know that we are the new refugees (as if there are not enough refugees and tents in the Arab world).</s> <s i="43">Since 1980, the settlements have been annexing our land bit by bit, and I worry that soon we will be no better than Thai and Filipino workers in Israel--day laborers on our own stolen land.</s> <s i="44">We told Abu Mazen that this land is as holy for us as Jerusalem, and that we will not exchange it for even the best of that city.</s> 

<s i="45">My message to you, the Quartet, is a simple one: to ask you to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to treat us as human beings.</s> <s i="46">If he could only respect Palestinians as humans, he would stop annexing our land, he would stop arresting our sons and he 
would release all our prisoners.</s>
