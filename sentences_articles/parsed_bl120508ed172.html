<s i="0">Last Thursday we Israelis celebrated Independence Day.</s> <s i="1">Later this week, Palestinians mark Nakba Day.</s> <s i="2">For sixty years now, these two events have constituted conflicting perceptions of the same seminal event.</s> <s i="3">It is only the vagaries of the Hebrew calendar that separate them.</s> 

<s i="4">I was interviewed last week by a Palestinian journalist friend regarding my feelings on the eve of Israel's sixtieth anniversary of independence.</s> <s i="5">Being at heart a &quot;security person&quot;</s> <s i="6">I remarked that, on balance, we have a lot to celebrate: the Arab world by and large is no longer fighting us but rather seeking peace in order to confront the common enemy, Iran and its proxies and allies.</s> <s i="7">That enemy looms ever larger, but we are strong and getting stronger.</s>

<s i="8">&quot;But doesn't the Nakba still weigh heavily on your celebrations?&quot; my Palestinian friend pressed me.</s>

<s i="9">I paused to reflect.</s> <s i="10">My reply had focused on Iran--the prism through which Israel now views its security surroundings--not Palestine.</s> <s i="11">&quot;No&quot;, I replied.</s> <s i="12">&quot;Tomorrow at our Independence Day barbecue I'll raise a glass with my family, look them in the eye and tell them that our cause has been fair and just.</s> <s i="13">For at least one day of the year, we have nothing to complain about.&quot;</s>

<s i="14">Let there be no mistake: I have dealt with the Nakba and its consequences day in and day out for more than 40 years.</s> <s i="15">More than most Israelis, I can empathize with the Palestinian &quot;case&quot; and even step into the other side's shoes when the need arises.</s> <s i="16">Yet the Nakba does not weigh on my conscience when I celebrate Israel's independence or for that matter on any other day of the year.</s>

<s i="17">By arguing that Israel was &quot;born in sin&quot;</s> <s i="18">60 years ago, the Palestinian Nakba narrative target's Israel's legitimacy in the most profound way.</s> <s i="19">Yet Israel as a sovereign state enjoys more international legitimacy than virtually any other country.</s> <s i="20">We were created by both the League of Nations (ratifying the Balfour Declaration) and the United Nations (UNGAR 181).</s> <s i="21">Two of our Arab neighbors have made peace with us, thereby recognizing us.</s> <s i="22">In contrast the Palestinians, backed and at times manipulated by the Arab world, have done nearly everything possible to avoid setting up their own state.</s> 

<s i="23">They rejected 181 in 1947 and attacked us, thereby precipitating war and exile.</s> <s i="24">They avoided creating a state in the West Bank and Gaza between 1949 and 1967, created UNWRA to legitimize their narrative by perpetuating rather than solving their refugee problem, rejected Egypt and Israel's offer of autonomy in 1978, failed at state-building under Oslo after 1993, invoked suicide terrorism that alienated some of their most ardent Israeli supporters, and failed again at consolidating some of the territorial foundations of a state after Israel withdrew unilaterally from Gaza in 2005.</s> 

<s i="25">Israel undoubtedly contributed to these failures, most spectacularly since 1967 with the settlement movement in the West Bank.</s>  <s i="26">But for Palestinians to blame us for their disasters or to assume that, because some of us devote our efforts to reaching a just solution to the conflict the Nakba must be weighing on our conscience, does a huge disservice to the Palestinian cause.</s> 

<s i="27">Indeed, perhaps the biggest difference between Palestinians and Israelis on the occasion of this sixtieth anniversary of their Nakba and our independence is that they blame everyone but themselves, having long ago adopted the role of history's victim, while we constantly blame ourselves, having at some early point in our renewed national history resolved to be a nation of complainers and doomsday purveyors, constantly bemoaning our faults and anticipating disasters.</s> <s i="28">We give our detractors endless ammunition with which to criticize us.</s> <s i="29">When our hapless prime minister remarks that unless we get out of most of the West Bank (which we definitely should do), &quot;Israel is finished&quot;, we can only blame ourselves for looking and feeling bad--indeed, for perpetuating the conflict by encouraging our most intractable enemies.</s>

<s i="30">One of the most negative aspects of Israeli-Palestinian interaction yearlong is that our political system produces coalition governments that are seemingly incapable of dealing effectively with the Palestinian issue.</s> <s i="31">Every single Israeli governing coalition over the past 20 years has fallen over the Palestinian question; the current Olmert government will inevitably follow suit, unless corruption does it in first.</s>

<s i="32">After reflection, let me add one more thought to my reply to the Palestinian journalist's question about the Nakba weighing on the Israeli conscience.</s> <s i="33">The plight of the Palestinian people since 1948, the horrors of flight and the depravations of refugee status should be understood by Jews better than anyone else in the world, regardless of their root cause.</s> <s i="34">Worse, the Palestinian dilemma has become our dilemma as we increasingly internalize the cruel truth that unless Palestinians achieve statehood and stability we can never fully consolidate our own dream of a Jewish and democratic state.</s>
