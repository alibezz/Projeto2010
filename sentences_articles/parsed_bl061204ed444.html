<s i="0">The Palestinian nonviolent movement is as old as the Palestinian liberation movement itself.</s> <s i="1">As far back as the 1930s, Palestinians engaged in nonviolent protests and demonstrations against the British Mandate authorities.</s> <s i="2">This form of protest peaked with the breakout of the 1987 intifada.</s> <s i="3">That uprising, which was for the most part nonviolent in nature, brought immediate international recognition to the Palestinian people, forced Israeli society to recognize Palestinians as a &quot;people&quot; and to recognize their legitimate leadership, and finally led to a peace process.</s> <s i="4">The failure of that peace process, known as the Oslo peace process was not due to the means that led to the negotiating table, on the contrary; it was largely due to the lack of continued mobilization and support by the Palestinian leadership of the popular Palestinian nonviolent resistance movement.</s> <s i="5">Nonviolent resistance should have continued as a means to balance the imbalance at the negotiating table, viewed by the Palestinian leadership as the only way of attaining the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.</s>

<s i="6">The failure of the peace process led to the breakout of the second intifada in 2000.</s> <s i="7">Again, Palestinians initially engaged in nonviolent forms of resistance, but the Israeli military response to these protests was more brutal and forceful than at any time before during the occupation.</s> <s i="8">This convinced some groups within the Palestinian community that only the use of arms and suicide attacks to balance out the pain being heaped upon Palestinians would be effective in making the occupation as costly as possible to the Israeli public.</s> <s i="9">This, however, combined with the lack of a clear strategy and a clear vision to mobilize the Palestinian population in nonviolent forms of resistance, emboldened the Israeli government to take full advantage of the change in the rules of engagement after September 11, 2001 and attempt to de-legitimize the entire Palestinian liberation movement, linking its goals with the means used to achieve them.</s> <s i="10">The Palestinian armed resistance, labeled as &quot;terrorism&quot; by Israel, was portrayed as the goal of the Palestinian liberation movement rather than a means, justified or otherwise.</s> 

<s i="11">The legitimacy of the goals of freedom and independence should not be viewed through the lens of the &quot;means&quot; used to achieve these goals.</s> <s i="12">The struggle to end the occupation and establish an independent Palestinian state does not gain or lose legitimacy if nonviolent means are preferred over violent means and vice versa.</s> <s i="13">Even with the changes in international politics and a steadily growing voice within the Palestinian community criticizing and condemning the armed resistance, particularly those actions that target Israeli civilians, the legitimacy of the Palestinian struggle is embedded in international law, international conventions on human rights and numerous United Nations resolutions, up until and including the most recent decision by the International Court of Justice regarding the separation wall.</s> 

<s i="14">A more important question deals with the issue of efficacy.</s> <s i="15">Are the means used effective in achieving the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people?</s> 

<s i="16">When discussing armed resistance, Palestinians must recognize both the internal and international implications of continuing the armed resistance.</s> <s i="17">The gross imbalance of power, the unrestrained and brutal actions of the Israeli military, and the change in the direction of world politics have left Palestinians defenseless and isolated in the face of daily aggressions.</s> <s i="18">The armed resistance, even armed defense, has been effective only in creating excuses for greater Israeli aggression.</s> 

<s i="19">But to say that one is ineffective is not to show that the other isn't. When it comes to nonviolent resistance, the question most people ask is how do you nonviolently resist your prison guard when you are in prison?</s> <s i="20">How do you resist the occupation when you are surrounded by walls and fences?</s> <s i="21">Examples of nonviolent resistance from across the world highlight one important factor: direct confrontation and contact with the enemy is vital to expose that enemy's brutality and unjust policies.</s> <s i="22">In Palestine today, however, Palestinians are trapped in a prison.</s> <s i="23">Going on hunger strike means absolutely nothing, while protesting and marching means walking around in circles.</s> <s i="24">So what nonviolent tactics can be used effectively to expose the occupation and affect its end?</s> 

<s i="25">The answer is threefold.</s> <s i="26">First, a strong leadership committed to the principles of nonviolent resistance and community building must be established.</s> <s i="27">The initial focus will be on the need to unify Palestinian communities and reestablish trust between the leadership and the people.</s> <s i="28">This should be followed by the development of a long-term internal strategy to build a nonviolent resistance movement on a massive scale.</s> 

<s i="29">Secondly, the Palestinian population inside and outside of Palestine must be mobilized in mass campaigns beginning with a boycott of Israeli products campaign and moving on to more dangerous protests at check points, on settler roads, and near international border crossings.</s> 

<s i="30">Finally and simultaneously, the Arab, Muslim, international streets as well as the Israeli peace camp must also be mobilized to support this nonviolent Palestinian movement.</s> <s i="31">Sustained and significant popular protests against Israel will eventually pressure the Israeli government to take the necessary steps towards peace.</s> 

<s i="32">Nonviolent resistance is never easy.</s> <s i="33">It takes tremendous dedication, discipline and sacrifice.</s> <s i="34">And while no means are guaranteed effective, the nonviolent approach attempts to neutralize the power of the enemy and to target the collective consciousness of the populace rather than empowering enemy extremists by handing them the blind and unconditional support of a people fearful of annihilation.</s>
