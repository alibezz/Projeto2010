<s i="0">Although it has been more than six years since the Quartet (the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations) publicly proposed the roadmap plan to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, little progress has been achieved.</s>

<s i="1">The roadmap is meant to realize the vision of two states, a secure state of Israel and a viable, contiguous, peaceful and democratic Palestine.</s> <s i="2">The document constitutes a framework for progress toward lasting peace and security in the Middle East.</s>

<s i="3">The roadmap comprises three goal-driven phases.</s> <s i="4">However, as a performance-based plan, progress requires and depends upon the good faith and efforts of both sides, the Palestinians and Israelis, and their compliance with each of their obligations in the three phases.</s>

<s i="5">In exchange for statehood, the roadmap obliges the Palestinian Authority to make democratic reforms and abandon the use of violence.</s> <s i="6">Israel, for its part, must support and accept the emergence of a reformed Palestinian government and end settlement activity in the Palestinian territories.</s>

<s i="7">While the Israeli Cabinet and former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon &quot;approved&quot; the roadmap, they attached 14 reservations to the plan.</s> <s i="8">The move was regarded as a political tactic to defeat ratification.</s> <s i="9">The Israeli reservations were coupled with Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip in the summer of 2005, which was aimed at strangling the roadmap and diverting international attention from Israeli compliance to a total freeze on settlement expansion, one of the main pillars of phase one of the roadmap.</s>

<s i="10">Sharon had rejected freezing all settlement activity including natural growth of settlements as &quot;impossible&quot; due to the &quot;need&quot; for settlers to build new houses and start families.</s> <s i="11">Sharon asked then US Secretary of State Colin Powell, &quot;What do you want, for a pregnant woman to have an abortion just because she is a settler?&quot;</s>

<s i="12">In addition to freezing all settlement expansion, there are a number of Israeli obligations under phase one of the roadmap: dismantling all unauthorized outposts erected since March 2001, reopening the Palestinian Chamber of Commerce and other Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem and withdrawing from Palestinian areas Israel took military control of after September 28, 2000.</s> <s i="13">Israel should also take all necessary steps to help normalize Palestinian life.</s> 

<s i="14">In the meantime, the Palestinians should immediately undertake an unconditional cessation of violence, dismantle the infrastructure of any violent activities, consolidate the security forces under the political echelon, undertake comprehensive political reform in preparation for statehood, including drafting a Palestinian constitution, and hold free, fair and open elections upon the basis of those measures.</s>

<s i="15">At the time of its signing, neither Israel nor the PA were interested in or--due to their respective internal politics--capable of complying with their commitments under the roadmap.</s> <s i="16">It was not until the death of Yasser Arafat in November 2004, the incapacitation of Sharon in January 2006, Hamas' landslide victory in Palestinian legislative elections in January 2006 and the subsequent Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip from Fatah-led forces in mid-June 2007, that the international community was once again persuaded to expend its efforts on the conflict, launching the Annapolis process in November 2007 and thus restarting efforts to implement the roadmap.</s>

<s i="17">Israeli settlement expansion, however, accelerated during the Annapolis process, particularly in East Jerusalem.</s> <s i="18">Now, the insistence of current Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to continue so-called &quot;natural growth&quot; of settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, in contravention of the roadmap, has increased the number of Palestinian and international voices warning that such a practice would render the two-state solution an impossibility.</s> 

<s i="19">Even US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said that Israel is in breach of the roadmap with its plans to continue settlement expansion.</s> <s i="20">But in spite of this, there is little sign of change.</s>

<s i="21">In his much-awaited June speech, Netanyahu announced Israel's acceptance of the roadmap while simultaneously rejecting a settlement freeze.</s> <s i="22">In rejecting President Barack Obama's call for a freeze Netanyahu claimed that settlement expansion, so called &quot;natural growth&quot;, was necessary.</s> <s i="23">Israel has also not performed well on its other obligations under the roadmap, particularly regarding dismantling all unauthorized outposts in the West Bank.</s>

<s i="24">The Palestinian Authority, by contrast, having lost the Gaza Strip to Hamas, knew that without complying with the roadmap no progress toward a two-state solution could occur.</s> <s i="25">Therefore, the PA and its security apparatuses increased their efforts against Palestinian armed activities and consolidated the security apparatuses under the Ministry of Interior.</s> <s i="26">The political reforms pursued by Prime Minister Salam Fayyad have also impressed the United States and the international community.</s>

<s i="27">International pressure is now on Israel to comply with its commitments under phase one of the roadmap, particularly by enacting a complete freeze on settlement expansion and dismantling all unauthorized outposts in the West Bank.</s> <s i="28">The credibility and determination of the United States and Obama are being tested.</s>
