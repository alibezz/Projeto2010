<s i="0">The anticipated meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) will reflect mainly personal, political and indirectly-related strategic considerations rather than the vain hope of advancing a peace process.</s> <s i="1">Neither leader commands a viable peace coalition, neither offers the other a persuasive formula for peace, and there is no powerful and engaged third party like the United States that is ready to commit heavy political capital to shepherding a process.</s>

<s i="2">A meeting is one of the few ways that both can remain relevant.</s> 

<s i="3">Olmert wants to show the Israeli public that he can develop a Palestinian agenda even without unilateral disengagement; he needs to distract the public's attention from the investigation of his perceived mishandling of the war in Lebanon.</s> <s i="4">If and when he frees Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Gilad Shalit, he needs to deliver them to Abu Mazen, not Hamas.</s> <s i="5">At the broader regional and global level, Olmert wants to preempt pressures from the moderate Arab states, the US and Europe to move forward on the Palestinian issue as a means of leveraging a broad coalition against Iran.</s>

<s i="6">Abu Mazen confronts a myriad of difficulties in trying to put together a unity coalition between Hamas and Fateh: for starters, Israel's and the international community's three conditions, Hamas' hard line and the reservations of many Fateh stalwarts.</s> <s i="7">A meeting with Olmert is not directly dependent on the success of these efforts, although without Shalit's release, which appears to be part of an internal Palestinian package that includes a unity government and a ceasefire commitment, Olmert will have little to say to Abu Mazen and there appears to be no point at all to the meeting.</s>

<s i="8">If the renewal of a genuine peace process is too ambitious a goal for an Olmert-Abu Mazen summit, what can we expect?</s> <s i="9">Here are best- and worst-case scenarios.</s>

<s i="10">In the best case, the meeting would coincide with and fortify a prisoner exchange and ceasefire agreement.</s> <s i="11">The Palestinian unity government that such a development appears to be dependent on would enhance Abu Mazen's prestige insofar as his own movement, Fateh, would be back in government and would receive key portfolios like foreign affairs.</s> <s i="12">For his part, Olmert could be strengthened in this best-case scenario by the success of Lebanese government and international efforts to neutralize Hizballah's military threat.</s> 

<s i="13">The two leaders would hold productive discussions on interim confidence-building measures like a coordinated Israeli withdrawal from part of the West Bank that involves the introduction of reliable Palestinian security forces trained by the Americans and Egyptians and/or an international force that exercises a limited form of trusteeship.</s> <s i="14">The entire process would be shepherded by an energetic and involved high-level American presidential envoy like Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.</s> <s i="15">The Arab League would improve upon its March 2002 peace plan and the Saudi, Egyptian and Jordanian leaders would present it to the two sides personally, accompanied by the offer of serious incentives.</s>

<s i="16">Don't hold your breath waiting for all of this to happen.</s> <s i="17">But even a portion of these positive developments would be welcome.</s>

<s i="18">In contrast, in the worst case the Olmert-Abu Mazen dialogue would go nowhere because neither side trusts the other.</s> <s i="19">American involvement would be confined, as in the past, to the Quartet, and would reflect a Middle East order of priorities that begins and ends with Iraq and Iran and essentially pays only lip service to the need for progress between Israelis and Palestinians.</s> <s i="20">Arab involvement and support would be superficial.</s> 

<s i="21">More important, Abu Mazen would prove incapable in this worst-case scenario of delivering on a cessation of violence and hesitant to accept interim territorial measures lest they constitute the beginning and the end of the process.</s> <s i="22">In parallel, Olmert's government would be overwhelmed politically by the aftermath of the Lebanon War and, a few months from now, a revived Hizballah would again destabilize Lebanon and its border with Israel.</s>
