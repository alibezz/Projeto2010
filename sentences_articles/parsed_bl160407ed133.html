<s i="0">The very fact we are conducting negotiations with Hamas for the release of IDF Corporal Gilad Shalit constitutes a display of ongoing Israeli weakness.</s> <s i="1">Yet Israel, confronted with the outrageous demand to release 1,400 terrorists in return for Shalit, still has an opportunity to right the strategic balance with the terrorist organizations.</s> <s i="2">Were Israel to evince the wisdom required for a radical policy change, this would also improve its strategic balance with those Arab countries that continue to consider the prospect of ending the existence of the Jewish-Zionist state in the Middle East.</s>

<s i="3">May 21, 1985 witnessed what has come to be known as the &quot;Jibril deal&quot;.</s> <s i="4">Some 1,115 terrorists were released in exchange for three Israeli soldiers who had been abducted in Lebanon.</s> <s i="5">According to statistics published by the Israel General Security Service (Shabak, or Shin Bet), more than 40 percent of those released went on to resume terrorist operations including acts of murder.</s> <s i="6">Those released in the Jibril deal also produced the Palestinian leadership that launched the 1989 intifada--that in many ways continues to this day.</s> 

<s i="7">With 22 years hindsight, that was a cancerous precedent.</s> <s i="8">The terrorist organizations discovered Israel's soft belly: the inability to withstand the pressures exerted by the families of the abducted soldiers.</s> <s i="9">Ever since, abductions have become routine: Israelis are kidnapped and Israeli governments, right- and left-wing, redeem the abductees with the wholesale release of terrorists.</s> <s i="10">It is these frequent capitulations, especially in the Lebanon arena, that led Hassan Nasrallah in 2000 to the conclusion that Israel had lost the will to fight and could be likened in its weakness to a spider web.</s> 

<s i="11">The man who convinced Nasrallah more than any other Israeli leader was Ariel Sharon.</s> <s i="12">Even this Israeli war hero, before whom the entire region quaked, gave in to the Hizballah leader's demand to release hundreds of terrorists, including some linked to the disappearance of IAF navigator Ron Arad, in return for no more than an Israeli drug dealer, Elhanan Tanenbaum, and the bodies of three dead soldiers.</s>

<s i="13">The consequences of that inexplicable capitulation were soon apparent: another attempt to abduct soldiers at Har Dov a few months later, followed by the resounding abduction of July 2006 that led to the Second Lebanon War, with all its negative ramifications for Israel's strategic position in the region.</s>

<s i="14">To repair even a modicum of the damage, Israel must institute a total revision of its policy of capitulation.</s> <s i="15">I propose that Israel disband the team that is negotiating with the go-betweens to Hamas and declare, as PM Ehud Olmert in fact did immediately after the Shalit abduction nine months ago, &quot;There will be no more prisoner exchange deals with the abductors; the blackmail season is over.&quot;</s> 

<s i="16">Israel knows that Shalit is alive and in good health.</s> <s i="17">It also knows who abducted him, who planned the abduction operation and who is currently aiding in concealing him and determining Palestinian negotiating policy.</s> <s i="18">Any harm to Shalit, Olmert should announce, will lead to physical attack against all these persons.</s> <s i="19">Israel can also render the Hamas &quot;political&quot; leadership, including PM Ismail Haniyeh, prisoners inside the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="20">No one from Hamas will leave or enter--certainly not those carrying suitcases full of cash--until Shalit is released.</s> <s i="21">And if these measures don't work, then Israel with its military might and special technical and other units undoubtedly has additional ways to deal with the crisis so that the psychological balance changes and it, rather than Hamas, sets the tone.</s>

<s i="22">True, even this development might not automatically alter the psychological balance with Hizballah, which is holding two abductees and is ostensibly tougher in its negotiating pose.</s> <s i="23">Yet Israel should adopt the same new and stubborn position with Hizballah, and send the same message regarding the welfare of the two soldiers in its hands.</s> <s i="24">Even if this proves of no avail, no more business should be done with Hizballah.</s> <s i="25">With all due regard for the pain of the abductees and their families, decision-makers in Israel should be guided by consideration for the country's strategic profile and the welfare of the soldiers or civilians who would be killed, wounded and imprisoned as a consequence of the release of terrorists and the implementation of additional kidnapping operations.</s> <s i="26">Our leaders must not be influenced by the pressures exerted by the families and friends of the imprisoned soldiers or by public opinion that has been manipulated down to a profile of weakness.</s>
