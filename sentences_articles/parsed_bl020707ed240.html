<s i="0">Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, has been appointed the Quartet's representative to promote Israeli-Palestinian peace.</s> <s i="1">Since hearing this news, my reaction has moved from dismay via detached analysis to the warmest of welcomes.</s>

<s i="2">First, dismay.</s> <s i="3">Here is the man whose brilliant understanding of Middle East issues led him to commit British prestige and resources in supporting the Bush administration's failed policies in Iraq and in the disastrous effort to &quot;democratize&quot; the region.</s> <s i="4">This is the leader who told an audience in Pakistan recently that Islamist extremism in that part of the world was generated by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and on whose prime ministerial watch the United Kingdom produced a home-grown generation of angry Islamists and, most recently, an epidemic of petty and despicable anti-Israel boycotts. v

Blair, like US President George W. Bush, cites his religious beliefs as inspiration for his Middle East policies.</s> <s i="5">I harbor a profound mistrust of religious motivation--Christian, Muslim or Jewish--for strategy and statesmanship in our part of the world.</s>

<s i="6">My second reaction was a more analytical look at Blair's new job.</s> <s i="7">His predecessor, James Wolfensohn, sought to exploit Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Gaza two years ago to promote economic development and well-being.</s> <s i="8">While his efforts failed, he can hardly be blamed for Palestinians' inability or unwillingness to keep the peace in Gaza and make good on the infrastructure left behind by Israel and the generous aid he recruited.</s> <s i="9">Nor is Ariel Sharon's unwillingness to even attempt to coordinate withdrawal with the PLO/PA Wolfensohn's fault.</s> 

<s i="10">But Tony Blair is a politician, not an economist.</s> <s i="11">The Quartet has commissioned him to help develop Palestinian political institutions.</s> <s i="12">In view of his energy and passion for the issue he will undoubtedly push for a broader mandate to foster options for a peace process; indeed, Bush may already envision Blair's mission in precisely this expanded context.</s> <s i="13">Yet how can either mission work when both the Palestinians and the Quartet are hopelessly divided and the international playing field so congested?</s>

<s i="14">The American and European members of the Quartet continue to boycott Hamas in Gaza.</s> <s i="15">The Russians and the United Nations are unhappy with this policy, which they feel was imposed on them by the United States, and believe it is counterproductive and helped bring about the Hamas coup in Gaza last month.</s> <s i="16">They seek contact with Hamas, as do Egypt and Saudi Arabia.</s> <s i="17">Which Quartet policy will Blair represent?</s> <s i="18">Which government will he help reorganize?</s>

<s i="19">Then, too, Blair will not be alone: the EU, Russia and the UN all have their own representatives working to alleviate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</s> <s i="20">The EU's Javier Solana and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice are also very active here, while Blair's fellow Europeans, whose backing he needs, consider him too &quot;American&quot; and complain they were never consulted regarding his appointment.</s> <s i="21">The EU has already tried at least once to help Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas organize his office, with no appreciable results.</s> <s i="22">Blair will have his work cut out for him merely to avoid repeating the failed efforts of his predecessors and tripping over his fellow global peacemakers.</s>

<s i="23">Inevitably, my ultimate reaction to the Blair appointment was to look for the bright side, the silver lining.</s> <s i="24">Blair is a talented and energetic man; by and large he has been quite fair and evenhanded in his attitude toward Israel.</s> <s i="25">He probably won't do any harm; he may even do some good.</s> <s i="26">At worst, he'll throw in the towel after a year or two and go home disabused of all his illusions.</s> <s i="27">At best, his legendary persuasive powers and charm will achieve real results.</s>
