<s i="0">A large number of key figures on the Israeli political scene today, from the prime minister and the president on down, have recently been investigated on charges of corruption and sex crimes; the latter, for our purposes, are surely a form of corruption insofar as they reflect the abuse of power.</s> <s i="1">The corruption investigations weaken the political underpinnings of the government.</s> <s i="2">And a weak government is ostensibly less able to engage in productive peace negotiations--or for that matter to take decisive military steps against our enemies--than a strong and stable government.</s>

<s i="3">That appears to be the logic that links corruption and governance on the one hand with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the other.</s> <s i="4">It does indeed seem to apply to the Olmert government.</s> <s i="5">Due to a combination of corruption charges and investigations of mismanagement of last summer's war, PM Ehud Olmert has lost public support and appears to lack both a mandate and the capacity to do much of anything.</s>

<s i="6">Yet the logic is too neat.</s> <s i="7">Indeed, our recent history shows it can be reversed.</s> <s i="8">Some of Ariel Sharon's close advisers have acknowledged that one of his motives for bringing about unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Gaza two years ago was to generate broad public support for his leadership, thereby enabling him to rebuff public pressures related to corruption investigations that focused on him and his family.</s> <s i="9">Here is a case of corruption in high places bringing about a dynamic new initiative, however flawed, in Israeli-Palestinian relations.</s> 

<s i="10">Then, too, changing standards regarding the definition of corruption render it difficult to assess the nature of its interaction with the conflict from an historic perspective.</s> <s i="11">By today's standards, Moshe Dayan was corrupt (he was a serial thief of protected antiquities) and a repeat sex offender.</s> <s i="12">In his day, these exploits merely burnished his image as a leader in war and peace.</s>

<s i="13">On the Arab side, too, corruption does not seem to have affected leaders' capacity to wage war and make peace; nor has it deterred us from negotiating with them.</s> <s i="14">On the other hand, the autocratic Arab regimes we have dealt with appear to have radically different standards for measuring corruption than we do.</s> 

<s i="15">Against this backdrop, Yasser Arafat was a special case.</s> <s i="16">Israel, which effectively installed him in power in 1994, willfully turned its back on the corruption cultivated by his regime within the Palestinian Authority, assuming that it would not affect--indeed, might enhance--his ability to &quot;deliver&quot; on security, thereby greasing the wheels of a successful peace process.</s> <s i="17">Whether Arafat's corruption and his acquiescence in terrorism against Israelis were linked is debatable.</s> <s i="18">But it is clear that his corruption contributed to Fateh's demise and Hamas' rise to power, thereby undoubtedly delaying if not destroying any hope of resolving the conflict.</s> <s i="19">The corruption Arafat sponsored and tolerated was a major factor in the Palestinians' failure at state-building over the past 14 years, hence a prime obstacle to peace.</s> <s i="20">Israel's role in this regard is secondary, but hardly one we can be proud of.</s>

<s i="21">Today in the Arab world, it is the Islamist movements that cultivate a reputation for clean government and aggrandize their power by pointing to the corruption seemingly endemic to secular regimes.</s> <s i="22">Yet the Islamists, for the most part, appear to be intent on perpetuating the Arab-Israel conflict.</s> <s i="23">Interestingly, in Israel politicians representing fundamentalist Judaism do not share this squeaky-clean reputation; they are as corrupt as secular politicians.</s>
