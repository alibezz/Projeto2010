<s i="0">The Palestinian legislative election, held on January 25, has attracted global interest well beyond the tiny boundaries of the West Bank and Gaza.</s> <s i="1">Even before the election, the Bush administration determined the timing and scope of the vote, imposing it on reluctant Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and the Israeli government.</s> <s i="2">And when the world learned of the Hamas landslide victory, it reacted with swift diplomatic activity.</s>

<s i="3">Despite its quasi-state status, rotten governance and lack of control over most of its territory as well as chronic bankruptcy, the PA enjoys global prominence--for two reasons.</s> <s i="4">First, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has always been the focus of international attention.</s> <s i="5">Second, the Palestinian election holds important consequences for the Bush-led effort to democratize the Arab world, the cornerstone of current American regional policy.</s> <s i="6">The Palestinians voted out Fateh, which ruled over their national institutions since the late 1960s, in favor of the Palestinian Islamic movement.</s> <s i="7">This peaceful regime change could serve as a precedent for other Arab states like Egypt and Jordan, where Hamas look-alikes are struggling to replace the existing political order.</s>

<s i="8">The Hamas victory took the international community by surprise.</s> <s i="9">Most observers expected a Hamas gain, but not a takeover.</s> <s i="10">According to diplomatic sources, the only one who got it right was UN Special Coordinator Alvaro de Soto.</s> <s i="11">Based on the wide UN deployment among Palestinians, de Soto alerted his colleagues to the expected Hamas win, but they didn't listen.</s> <s i="12">Nevertheless, after learning the election results, the &quot;world&quot; was quick to react.</s> <s i="13">Within a few days the Quartet--the US, EU, UN and Russia, which coordinates policy over Israel-Palestine--reached a two-pillared consensus, at least for the interim, cabinet-forming period.</s>

<s i="14">The first pillar is recognizing the PA election as &quot;free, fair and secure&quot; and therefore respecting its result.</s> <s i="15">The Quartet turned a deaf ear to Israeli complaints, sounded by new Foreign Minister Tzippi Livni, that the election was less than democratic due to the participation of an armed terrorist group like Hamas.</s>

<s i="16">The second, more important, pillar deals with the post-election Palestinian government.</s> <s i="17">The Quartet set three benchmarks for future recognition and financial aid: &quot;members of a future Palestinian government must be committed to nonviolence, recognition of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the Roadmap.&quot;</s> <s i="18">The formula is not entirely new; it has been floating around in recent months.</s> <s i="19">British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw proposed back in June that recognition of Hamas be conditioned on its disarming and recognizing Israel.</s> <s i="20">His American counterpart, Condoleezza Rice, recalled the &quot;Irish model&quot; in which political participation preceded the eventual disarmament by several years.</s>

<s i="21">Israeli government analysts sensed differences among Quartet members, with the US adhering as expected to a stronger anti-Hamas stance, the EU hinting at a possible indirect dialogue (imitating the Lebanese Hizballah model) and Russia viewing Hamas as a legitimate political, rather than terrorist, entity.</s> <s i="22">The American position, presented by President George W. Bush in his State of the Union address on January 31, goes beyond the Quartet statement and calls upon the leaders of Hamas to &quot;recognize Israel, disarm, reject terrorism, and work for lasting peace.&quot;</s> <s i="23">Nevertheless the Bush administration joined its transatlantic partners in their blanket policy.</s>

<s i="24">The new international stance includes a tacit prize for Hamas: it implies a pardon for its past atrocities in return for future good behavior.</s> <s i="25">The Quartet is ready to ignore the murderous record of the group if it shelves its ideology of destroying Israel and follows the terrorist-turned-peacemaker path of Yasser Arafat.</s> <s i="26">In other words, terror is a matter of power, not principle.</s> <s i="27">If you're strong enough politically, the world will forgive your suicide bombings.</s>

<s i="28">Israel's government, headed by Acting PM Ehud Olmert, accepted the global dictum and even portrayed the three Quartet benchmarks as a major diplomatic victory.</s> <s i="29">In fact, Israel had to forgo its previous rejection of any dialogue with Hamas.</s> <s i="30">Earlier, Israel had lobbied western governments to put Hamas on their list of designated terrorist groups, and now it has agreed to conditional clemency.</s> <s i="31">There still remain differences between Olmert's position and the Quartet's, mainly over the demand for Hamas to disarm and cancel its 1988 covenant, which calls for Israel's obliteration.</s> <s i="32">But for his political convenience, especially during the Israeli election campaign, Olmert has chosen to ignore these discrepancies.</s>
