<s i="0">The irony in examining how the Oslo accords are referred to in today�s parlance is that those who support the accords believe that they were responsible for the only progress to be made in the history of the conflict and that the departure from their text is the reason behind the current peace process collapse.</s> <s i="1">Those who oppose the Oslo agreement, on the other hand, believe that it is largely responsible for the chaos and failure that we are now suffering.</s> 

<s i="2">In any case, the debate over how to proceed, as well as political groupings in both Palestinian and Israeli societies, continue to be based on one�s position vis-&amp;agrave;-vis the Oslo accords, which means that Oslo continues to be seen as a cornerstone in constructing political positions concerning the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</s> <s i="3">The most recent example of this can be found in local and international discussion of the recent appointment of a new Palestinian prime minister.</s> <s i="4">Both here and abroad, the quoted credentials of newly nominated Prime Minister Ahmad Qrei� include his integral part in negotiating the 1993 Oslo agreement.</s>

<s i="5">In thinking about Oslo, one major characteristic that must be pointed out--and that Israelis often forget or ignore--is that the three years prior to the outbreak of the intifada in the year 2000 marked the only sustained period in the history of the Israeli occupation that was not marred by violence between the two sides, barring a few minor exceptions.</s> <s i="6">The reason was that the Oslo framework offered Palestinians the impression, rightly or wrongly, that it was about ending the occupation, at the same time that it gave the Israeli public the impression that Oslo would bring peace and an end to the conflict.</s> <s i="7">Unfortunately, the politicians did not live up to the expectations of their respective publics.</s> <s i="8">It is impossible, in evaluating what went wrong, to ignore the major turning point that occurred when a Jewish terrorist assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was to a large extent responsible for both allowing Oslo to happen, and seriously pursuing its implementation.</s> 

<s i="9">Unfortunately, the very same political mindset that characterized that assassin now dominates the Israeli government.</s> <s i="10">The Israeli peace camp, which might be represented by the slain Rabin, remains in the opposition.</s> <s i="11">This situation sums up the essence of the change responsible for the difficulties we face in resuming the negotiations process.</s> 

<s i="12">By the same token, the changes that are now happening within the Palestinian political arena are irrelevant to the chances of resuming the Oslo peace process, simply because the major disputes we are seeing are not between the Oslo peace camp and its opponents, but rather within the same peace camp that made Oslo possible.</s> <s i="13">Whether we have Mahmoud Abbas or Ahmad Qrei� as prime minister, whether we have President Arafat alone in the leadership or alongside a prime minister, Palestinians will remain under the very same leadership that brought us the Oslo peace process and years of quiet.</s>
