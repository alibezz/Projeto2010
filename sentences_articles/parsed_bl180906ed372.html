 <s i="0">Wars can have surprising consequences--especially those, like Israel's war against Hizballah, that start as a knee-jerk reaction rather than as calculated strategy.</s> <s i="1">In an irony that hopefully will not escape the attention of Israel's leaders, once it was clear that the goal of bringing Hizballah to its knees could not be attained the war objective was changed to that of deploying a strong international force in southern Lebanon, mandated by the much vilified United Nations and manned by &quot;anti-Semite&quot;</s> <s i="2">Europeans.</s> <s i="3">By exposing the limits of Israel's deterrence, Hizballah might have helped Israel to integrate the concept of international legitimacy and the good services of the UN as a component of its security doctrine.</s>

<s i="4">The solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will have to come from the international community or there will be no solution at all.</s> <s i="5">The poor record of observance of agreements by the parties as well as the need to guard against revisionist attempts by either side require that any progress in the peace process be guaranteed by a multinational peace-keeping force that would also put in place strict mechanisms of implementation and monitoring.</s> <s i="6">The way the recent war in Lebanon ended creates a chance for a possible reconciliation on the part of Israel with what I believe is a compelling necessity to internationalize the solution of the conflict.</s> 

<s i="7">This can clearly be Europe's moment in the Israeli-Palestinian process as well.</s> <s i="8">Even before the war in Lebanon, Israel was forced to entrust the Europeans with the control and monitoring of the Rafah border, the only land crossing between the Gaza Strip and the Arab world.</s> <s i="9">This is the first time since 1967 that an international task force, not Israel, controls a foreign Palestinian border.</s> 

<s i="10">The validity of the European way--multilateralism and UN-mandated peacekeeping--is being enhanced by the dramatic decline of US credibility in the Middle East and the resounding failure of Israel's and America's unilateralist philosophy.</s> <s i="11">By completely turning its back on Clinton's peacemaking legacy and losing all channels of communication with Israel's enemies (Hizballah, Iran, Hamas, Syria), America has helped put Europe in the unfamiliar position of a viable alternative.</s> 

<s i="12">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has recently called for an international force to be deployed in the Palestinian territories.</s> <s i="13">Yet the conditions for the Lebanese pattern to be applied in the Palestinian territories have still to be created.</s> 

<s i="14">An international force can be efficient when it has a clear mandate, and only when there is a legitimate framework for a possible settlement between the parties to the conflict.</s> <s i="15">This is clearly not the case in the West Bank.</s> <s i="16">In Lebanon, there is an agreed border and a central government that has fully endorsed the mandate of the international force.</s> <s i="17">On the Palestinian front there is no agreed common platform between the parties as to the outline of a peace settlement that the international force could be expected to uphold, nor is there a unified central authority to legitimize the mandate of such a force.</s> <s i="18">The fluid lines of demarcation between the parties and the prevailing state of practical anarchy make the deployment of an international force extremely unlikely.</s>

<s i="19">Ideally, the task of the international force should be to supervise and monitor the implementation of steps and measures that the parties have agreed to carry out.</s> <s i="20">Yes, the roadmap is in theory &quot;an agreed peace platform&quot; that could be supervised and upheld by an international force.</s> <s i="21">But the parties still have conflicting interpretations of this document, which means that the international force would have to confront head-on the Palestinian &quot;terrorist infrastructure&quot; and force the Israelis to dismantle the illegal outposts as stipulated by the first provisions of the roadmap.</s> <s i="22">Likewise, the international force should help secure the creation of a Palestinian state within provisional borders, as also stipulated by the roadmap.</s> <s i="23">But the Palestinians have utterly rejected that particular provision.</s> 

<s i="24">There is, however, one area where an international force can and should be deployed even before the contour of a settlement has been agreed by the parties.</s> <s i="25">That is Gaza, where for all practical purposes the Israeli occupation has ended.</s> <s i="26">More specifically, it is at the Rafah crossing that the European civilian task force, currently suspended due to the prevailing anarchy, needs to be reinforced by a military contingent whose deployment includes the Palestinian side of the philadelphi road, where the border with Egypt has become wide open to the massive smuggling of weapons.</s> <s i="27">Notwithstanding the unilateral nature of Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, an international force can operate here within clear lines of demarcation and under a mandate that is not too ambiguous.</s> 

<s i="28">Even so, for the Hamas government to be willing to cooperate with the international force, it would be necessary to end the international boycott to which it has been subjected since it came to office.</s> <s i="29">The creation of a Palestinian national unity government that would subscribe to all previous agreements between Israel and the Palestinians might help grant Ismail Haniyeh's government the necessary legitimacy, thereby providing the international force the broad political framework within which it could operate.</s>
