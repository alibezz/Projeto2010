<s i="0">Israel�s wall in East Jerusalem slices through Palestinian communities and Palestinian lives like a 
dagger.</s> 

<s i="1">Since 1967, Israeli policy in East Jerusalem has been designed to encourage Jewish Israeli 
settlement and to decrease the number of Palestinian residents through a series of punitive building 
and residency laws that are only applied to non-Jews.</s> <s i="2">The wall excises Palestinian communities from 
the landscape of East Jerusalem, containing them in isolated, disconnected ghettos.</s> 

<s i="3">By the time the Jerusalem wall is completed, more than 90 percent of the East Jerusalem district 
will be absorbed by Israel.</s> <s i="4">About 250,000 Palestinians will be stranded in walled enclosures and cut 
off from both East Jerusalem and other urban centers.</s> <s i="5">They will lose access to schools, 
universities, medical facilities, the Haram al-Sharif and Church of the Holy Sepulchre--and each 
other.</s> 

<s i="6">The 15,000 Jerusalem residents who live in Qalandia and Kufr Aqab, which are north of the wall, are 
likely to lose their Jerusalem residency rights altogether.</s> <s i="7">To the northwest, the wall imprisons Bir 
Nabala, Judeira, Jib, and the old city of Beit Hanina (combined population 14,000).</s> <s i="8">The southern 
part of the wall cuts off Bethlehem, Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, and their refugee camps (comb. pop.</s> 
<s i="9">170,000) from East Jerusalem and from the central and northern West Bank.</s> <s i="10">It also imprisons the 
1,600 residents of Walaja.</s> 

<s i="11">Since 1967, the stated policy of the Jerusalem Municipality has been to create a ratio of 78 Jews 
for every 28 Palestinians.</s> <s i="12">So the Municipality confiscated land from Palestinians and made it 
available only to Jews, revoked the residency rights of Palestinians (but not Jews) and required 
that they continually prove their rights, denied building permits only to Palestinian residents, and 
demolished illegally built Palestinian homes.</s> <s i="13">The Jerusalem wall ratchets up this policy by carving 
Palestinian communities out of East Jerusalem and making it impossible for people to conduct the 
activities of everyday life.</s> 

<s i="14">Palestinians in the town of al Ram between East Jerusalem and Ramallah (and east of the wall) will 
lose their livelihoods as the result of the wall.</s> <s i="15">Al Ram�s population grew to 60,000 with the influx 
of Jerusalem residents who were unable to build homes in East Jerusalem.</s> <s i="16">It became a lively hub of 
transportation between the two larger cities.</s> <s i="17">Now, however, the wall slices through al Ram and 
encircles most of the town, killing work opportunities.</s>

<s i="18">More fundamentally, the wall creates a labyrinthine maze residents must negotiate to cross even 
trivial distances.</s> <s i="19">In August 2003, I met Fatima Assad, a schoolteacher who lives in Qalandia and 
works in East Jerusalem, who told me how the fragment of the wall that was in place when we met 
changed her seven kilometer commute into a two to three hour daily ordeal, much of it spent on foot.</s> 

<s i="20">It is a scene that is becoming all too familiar throughout the occupied territories.</s> <s i="21">If the wall is 
completed as planned, 43.5% of the West Bank will be annexed to Israel.</s> <s i="22">When one considers the 
implications of the wall in the context of the network of bypass roads (for Israeli settlers only), 
access roads (restricting entry to Palestinian towns to one or two gated roads that are locked 
overnight), and more than 480 checkpoints that make travel between Palestinian towns nearly 
impossible, it becomes clear that the West Bank has been divided into impoverished cantons 
subdivided into ghettos.</s> <s i="23">This can only be described as a policy of ethnic cleansing.</s>
 
<s i="24">The course of the wall was defined, not to prevent suicide bombings (an argument that would have 
been hard to refute had the wall been built on the green line) but rather to inflict the maximum 
amount of damage on Palestinian society.</s> <s i="25">The wall implements what Prime Minister Ariel Sharon stated 
(as reported by The Times on August 24, 1988) as his preference: �You don�t simply bundle people 
onto trucks and drive them away. . . .</s> <s i="26">I prefer to advocate a positive policy, to create, in 
effect, a condition that in a positive way will induce people to leave.� 

What legitimate security needs are met by Israel�s demand that Palestinians in the �seam area� (that 
is, those who find themselves west of the wall) secure permits from Israeli military authorities 
simply to live in their own homes?</s> <s i="27">If Israeli security is the issue, what is the justification for 
separating Palestinian communities from each other?</s> <s i="28">How are Israelis more secure when the 40,000 
residents of Qalqilya, surrounded on all sides by an eight meter high wall, are denied a view of the 
sunset?</s> 

<s i="29">The Israeli political establishment seems to believe that if it stomps long and hard enough on the 
Palestinians, they will forego their national and political rights.</s> <s i="30">So Israel bulldozed Jenin and 
Nablus and more recently Rafah.</s> <s i="31">This policy is sterile and ultimately will fail.</s> <s i="32">How much longer 
will the Israeli public and Israel�s supporters abroad accept Israel�s predatory definition of its 
security needs?</s> 

<s i="33">My main concern is how much longer Palestinians will have to spend their time, energies, and 
creativity just finding ways to survive and maintain their sense of dignity in the face of Israel�s 
relentless attacks.</s> <s i="34">No people should be so cruelly tested.</s>
