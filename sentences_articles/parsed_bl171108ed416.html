<s i="0">The identity of the party responsible for the collapse of the national reconciliation effort between Fateh and Hamas is no longer relevant.</s> <s i="1">All involved parties are now definitely permitted to throw mud at one another and announce &quot;I actually wanted, tried, invested efforts and was blocked.&quot;</s> <s i="2">Everyone will look justified.</s>

<s i="3">This is a game with open cards.</s> <s i="4">Hamas doesn't have the slightest interest in reconciling with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) or in permitting Fateh's security forces to enter the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="5">On the contrary, Hamas has every interest in stalling over the coming weeks in order to reach January 9, 2009 and declare that by international standards Abbas has become an illegitimate leader.</s> <s i="6">The threats leveled against Gazans identifying with Fateh to cancel the memorial assembly honoring Yasser Arafat and even not to print posters of the &quot;old man&quot; clearly convey the mood in the Strip: Arafat and Abu Mazen are &quot;out&quot;; any attempt to bring about a reconciliation agreement is liable to weaken Hamas' grip and bargaining power.</s>

<s i="7">On the other side, Fateh leaders similarly display little enthusiasm for legitimizing Hamas.</s> <s i="8">For them, the draft national reconciliation agreement that was supposed to be signed ten days ago in Cairo is no more than a shaky leaf.</s> <s i="9">Public legitimization of Hamas by Fateh would only strengthen Hamas' foothold in the West Bank.</s> 

<s i="10">Mahmoud Zahar, the impressive (in Israeli eyes as well) Hamas leader in Gaza, sees a triple conspiracy emerging before his very eyes: Israel, Egypt and Abu Mazen are discretely cooperating in a search for ways to get rid of him and his colleagues.</s> <s i="11">Israeli PM Ehud Olmert, in Zahar's eyes, succeeded in persuading Egyptian President Husni Mubarak not to open the Rafah border crossing.</s> <s i="12">The same Olmert also convinced Abu Mazen not to release Hamas prisoners in the West Bank, and undertook to reinforce Abu Mazen's leadership as January 9 approaches.</s>

<s i="13">In this open card game the three &quot;conspirators&quot;, Abu Mazen, Israel and Egypt, assessed early on that the Cairo meeting would in any case end in failure.</s> <s i="14">In that case, why shouldn't Israel prevent the departure of the Hamas delegation to Cairo?</s> <s i="15">Why should Abu Mazen release Hamas prisoners in the West Bank?</s> <s i="16">As for the Egyptians, not only are their security forces repeatedly confiscating huge quantities of weapons and ammunition in Sinai that were destined for the Gaza tunnels, but they are also warning of enhanced Russian-made rockets being fired at Israel.</s> <s i="17">All the appeals to establish an independent Palestinian state aren't worth the paper they're printed on: the other partners recognize that Hamas/Damascus and Hamas/Gaza prefer to maintain the current situation of two mini-states--one in the West Bank and the other in Gaza.</s>

<s i="18">Taghreed al-Khodary, the New York Times correspondent in Gaza, presents a sad and frustrating picture of 1.5 million residents.</s> <s i="19">The Gazan man-on-the-street has been taken hostage by his leaders.</s> <s i="20">It's hard to live with electricity outages and it's insufferable to manage with chronic shortages in produce, especially food, clothing and basic electric goods.</s> <s i="21">What is smuggled through the tunnels costs three or four times the normal price; who can afford to pamper themselves by paying black market prices?</s> <s i="22">Gaza, which has become a &quot;city of underground malls&quot;, will find it difficult to leave the tunnels even if national reconciliation is reached.</s> <s i="23">With the blessings of Hamas leaders there are reportedly 600-800 supply tunnels flourishing beneath the surface.</s> <s i="24">Today you order and the day after tomorrow you receive your goods.</s> <s i="25">You pay on the spot.</s> 

<s i="26">Were 1.5 million Gazans currently under siege to take to the streets, to demand to change the regime, to attempt to form a third party--neither Hamas nor Fateh but a political body dedicated solely to the welfare of the Palestinian people, one not dependent on directives sent from hundreds of kilometers away--then it would be possible to reach national reconciliation.</s> <s i="27">But Gaza is not currently built for miracles.</s> <s i="28">Even if they are miserable, people are afraid to challenge an armed, coercive leadership.</s> <s i="29">The open card game between the West Bank and Gaza will not soon reach a happy end.</s>
