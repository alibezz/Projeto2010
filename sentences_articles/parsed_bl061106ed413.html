<s i="0">Our region with its vital resources and strategic location is at a boiling point, and the course of events here has a direct impact on international stability.</s> <s i="1">From here, a world war could break out.</s> <s i="2">Conversely, from here global peace could prevail.</s> 

<s i="3">It is widely understood, except in the US and Israel, that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is at the center of regional tension, in the sense that reaching agreement on this conflict would be key to defusing the regional situation.</s> <s i="4">But because the United States and Israel have not accepted this opinion, instead relying on the use of overwhelming force, the situation has been complicated by greater and greater resentment of US and Israeli policies and thus further escalation.</s>  

<s i="5">To address the powder-keg regional situation, efforts must start with Palestine-Israel, and any successful conclusion to this conflict must achieve the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people.</s> <s i="6">But endeavors toward a settlement of this conflict have been exerted over the past 15 years, and these endeavors were characterized by Israeli intransigence and complete American bias toward Israel in an attempt to impose a settlement on the Palestinians.</s> <s i="7">This led to the complete failure to reach any positive conclusion from lengthy and open-ended negotiations.</s>  

<s i="8">The failure did not result from the porous mechanisms of the negotiating process alone--even though this had significant negative impacts--but also from the lack of any real desire among the Israelis and Americans to reach a satisfactory settlement to this chronic conflict.</s>  

<s i="9">The success of any future attempts at re-launching the political process will depend on a change of both intentions and mechanisms.</s> <s i="10">Specifically, there must be recognition of not only the principle of the two-state solution but also the realization of this solution according to international resolutions regarding borders, based on the status quo of June 4, 1967.</s>  <s i="11">Without this initial recognition, all attempts at imposing a settlement on the Palestinian side will fail.</s> 

<s i="12">There are those who believe that since the process is in such a crisis, the best and most successful way to turn it around is to adopt a gradual step-by-step approach in order to rebuild trust between the two warring sides in the interim.</s> <s i="13">It is argued that going directly to final status negotiations on all aspects of the settlement will only lead to another eruption of the already disastrous situation.</s>  

<s i="14">The proponents of this interim approach say a step-by-step settlement will allow the sides to reach partial agreements that accumulate with time, increasing trust and leading, inevitably, to a settlement.</s> <s i="15">However, critics of this approach say it has been tried in the past and failed to produce a final settlement, because the stronger party--that is, Israel and America--controls the course of the negotiating process and can halt interim steps at any point that suits its interests.</s>  

<s i="16">For the weaker party--the Palestinians/Arabs--there is no way to guarantee that each step will follow the next, if the stronger party is not willing to let it happen.</s> <s i="17">Basically, the stronger party controls the negotiating process, the course of the interim period and hence its final outcome.</s>  

<s i="18">In light of the failure of Oslo and its interim stage, some now insist that a reactivation of the peace process requires the immediate entry into final-status negotiations.</s> <s i="19">The advocates of this approach insist that reaching a settlement depends on finalizing the fundamental and thorniest issues immediately so there is no opportunity for either of the negotiating parties, but especially the stronger party, to reconsider, procrastinate or retreat.</s>  

<s i="20">We can take it as granted that there can be no imposed settlement.</s> <s i="21">Any imposed settlement will generate neither peace nor stability in the region.</s> <s i="22">But in order to reach agreement, two conditions must obtain.</s> <s i="23">First, the goal of the process must be clearly defined, i.e., an end to the Israeli occupation and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the basis of the borders of pre-June 4, 1967.</s> <s i="24">Secondly, a specific time period should be stipulated that would allow the parties gradually to reach that goal.</s>
