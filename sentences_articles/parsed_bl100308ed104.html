<s i="0">Five years ago, I was the first to advocate dissolving the Palestinian Authority and since then I have been stressing the need for Palestinians to take this suggestion seriously.</s> <s i="1">But the suggestion was faced with immediate rejection from various circles within and connected to the PA. Some considered it the attempt of a critic (thus one who represents the opposition) to destroy the Authority and through it the &quot;national project&quot;.</s> <s i="2">Others considered it an academic exercise and were skeptical about what forces would fill the vacuum created by the absence of the Authority and who would guarantee the salaries of public employees.</s> <s i="3">But a majority provided the most astonishing reason for their immediate rejection of the idea: Israel would never accept the resumption of its duties as an occupier.</s> 

<s i="4">The idea when I proposed it was not a mere academic fantasy.</s> <s i="5">Nor was it a response to an evolving incompetent and corrupt Authority that had created a stratum of society completely dependent on it and always ready to defend it.</s> <s i="6">Furthermore, the expected Israeli rejection should be considered in favor of the idea rather than against it.</s> <s i="7">Israel, the occupier, could never be expected to accept anything that favors the Palestinians.</s> 

<s i="8">Dissolving the Authority would be the most serious step taken by the Palestinians to end this prolonged Israeli occupation.</s> <s i="9">However, it should not be seen as an end in itself, but rather as a means to achieve an end.</s> <s i="10">It should be viewed as part of a strategic option, rather than being itself the option.</s> <s i="11">It should be considered as a necessary step needed to achieve the one-state solution.</s>

<s i="12">Since the beginning of the conflict, the intention of the Zionist movement was to &quot;remove&quot;</s> <s i="13">Palestinians and take their place: &quot;a land without a people for a people without a land&quot;.</s> <s i="14">After numerous attempts, even after successfully establishing a state in 1948 and occupying the remaining part of Palestine in 1967, Israel failed miserably in achieving its objective, however.</s> <s i="15">Palestinians remained in Palestine and have been growing in number.</s> <s i="16">Demography will be the basic determining element of this conflict.</s> 

<s i="17">When Israel realized its predicament, it opted for a negotiated settlement with Palestinians for a two-state solution.</s> <s i="18">The PLO had accepted this option since 1988 and has been eager to reach a settlement with Israel on the basis of the 1967 borders (give and take minor alterations).</s> <s i="19">The PLO was ready for a settlement that would end the occupation and result in the establishment of an independent sovereign Palestine which would live in peace with its neighboring countries, including Israel.</s>

<s i="20">Throughout the 15-year long negotiation process, however, Israel has taken the Palestinian Authority for an easy ride.</s> <s i="21">The Authority was, according to the Oslo Accords, supposed to be established for five years as a temporary and transitional measure.</s> <s i="22">But ever since its inception, it has not only been dragged into meaningless negotiations, but also been forced to take full responsibility over the Palestinian &quot;inhabitants&quot; in the occupied territories.</s> 

<s i="23">Israel has been using negotiations as a cover to enhance its presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.</s> <s i="24">The ongoing land confiscation policy along with the expansion of the settlement policy and the building of the separation wall are rendering a two-state solution obsolete.</s> <s i="25">Israel wants to have its cake and eat it too: it wants to retain as much land as possible while getting rid of as many Palestinians as possible through the creation of a Palestinian state of leftovers.</s> <s i="26">It will then claim that a two-state solution has been achieved and that therefore the book should be closed on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict forever.</s> 

<s i="27">Israel should not be allowed to achieve its goal.</s> <s i="28">It is clear from past negotiations experience that Israel is simply not interested in a proper two-state solution, only one that leads to imprisoning Palestinians into separate cantons that can then be called a state.</s>

<s i="29">The only way Israel might become serious about a two-state solution is if its existence as a Jewish state is threatened.</s> <s i="30">Such a threat cannot come through an everlasting open negotiating process or by launching handmade rockets at Israel's borders.</s> <s i="31">A serious threat is only posed if Palestinians announce to Israel and the world at large that they will pursue a two-state solution through negotiations until the end of 2008 (as US President George W. Bush proposed).</s> <s i="32">If no tangible results are forthcoming, then Palestinians should pay heed to the lesson, close the door on this option and refocus their efforts toward the one-state option.</s> <s i="33">This option requires dissolving the Authority, thus forcing Israel to face up to the real challenge of maintaining its existence as a Jewish state.</s> 

<s i="34">Instead of currently continuing the pursuit of independence, the Palestinian strategy should begin to aim at total integration within the state of Israel.</s> <s i="35">It has become clear that a sovereign and independent Palestinian state cannot be established without going through the path of a one-state solution.</s>
