<s i="0">In the early 1990s something called the &quot;peace industry&quot; was in full bloom.</s> <s i="1">It was hard to distinguish between those pursuing peace out of decent motives and those who abused the resources that suddenly became available.</s> <s i="2">NGOs grew like mushrooms after rain.</s>

<s i="3">Since then matters have become more complicated, and peace is no longer so popular.</s> <s i="4">In parallel, all the &quot;peace merchants&quot; have disappeared--but so too did many good people who simply couldn't manage in a difficult reality.</s> <s i="5">Those who remain, those still active, at times against all the odds, are the hard core that continues to believe that peace and reconciliation must emerge not only from agreements, handshakes and on occasion kisses between leaders, but also from the bottom up.</s>

<s i="6">Two years ago two organizations, one Israeli (the Peres Center for Peace) and one Palestinian (Panorama) decided to establish &quot;The Palestinian-Israeli Peace NGO Forum&quot;.</s> <s i="7">Today, the forum counts more than 120 Israeli and Palestinian organizations that employ a variety of methods and approaches but share a single objective: advancing peace, dialogue and reconciliation between the two peoples.</s> <s i="8">This is not a political organization or establishment that sponsors a single solution--although the large majority believes that a fair solution of two states for two peoples is the road to peace--but rather an umbrella forum that brings together the civil society organizations from both sides of the green line that believe in the need to create synergy, coordination and cooperation in order to help and be helped and to exercise greater influence.</s> <s i="9">But these 120 organizations do not represent only themselves.</s> <s i="10">They are in fact the tip of the iceberg that seeks to link the majority of the Israeli and Palestinian publics who repeatedly tell the pollsters: we want peace, we agree to the solutions on the table, but we don't believe the other side is really interested.</s>

<s i="11">It is this seam between the two publics that the peace organizations inhabit.</s> <s i="12">Our basic assumption is that eventually we'll reach a peace agreement.</s> <s i="13">This is liable to take time and, sadly, to take an additional toll in human lives, but there is no alternative, or rather, the alternative is worse.</s> <s i="14">Hence, at the end of the day an agreement will become preferable.</s> <s i="15">While this is not the place to discuss the conditions of peace, it is clear that both populations will continue to live side by side, with the same ecology, economic and trade ties and interdependence.</s> <s i="16">Hence we must begin today to lay the foundations and build the bridges--the relations that will stabilize our future.</s>

<s i="17">The spectrum of relations is as wide as possible, beginning with humanitarian concern, via education for peace and a joint approach to resources and the environment and ending with economic cooperation and the creation of an infrastructure for the future state.</s> <s i="18">There is no lack of examples elsewhere in the world.</s> <s i="19">Peace in Northern Ireland is based on huge investments in money and recruitment of public support for a civil and economic dialogue between the sides.</s> <s i="20">Relations between Germany and France were built on civil dialogue, economic cooperation and education and peace processes that today form the solid foundation of the European community.</s> <s i="21">Had German-French political and security stability not been created by their leaders despite hatred, fear and mistrust, the European Steel &amp; Coal Community would have become a footnote to history.</s> <s i="22">In the European case, economic cooperation and dialogue nurtured one another.</s>

<s i="23">At the Peres Center for Peace we concentrate on five areas of activity:


 The humanitarian program comprises mainly the medical project Saving Children through which every year some 800 Palestinian children are hospitalized and treated in Israel in branches of medicine not available to them in Palestine.</s> 
 <s i="24">Our capacity-building activities reflect the Israeli interest that the country next to us be a stable, strong and progressive state where people want to live.</s> <s i="25">Hence we are involved in agriculture, water, science, IT, health and other pursuits.</s> <s i="26">Training and the transfer of knowledge, in a spirit of cooperation and without patronizing, are ways to strengthen our neighboring society and create a relationship that lasts over time.</s> <s i="27">Forty Palestinian doctors currently training at Israeli hospitals and hundreds of Gazan strawberry farmers who benefited over a period of years from Israeli know-how and instruction constitute a bridge to peace and reconciliation.</s> 
 <s i="28">Economy and trade: We hold dozens of business meetings and joint sector activities, host delegations from Gaza and the West Bank and sponsor shared operative research and brainstorming about the economic future, both under peace and at times of crisis.</s> 
 <s i="29">Our education for peace program recognizes that altering the mindset and creating a culture of peace values from a very early age are vital.</s> <s i="30">Over the past three years, tens of thousands of Jews and Arabs have participated in these activities of the center.</s>
 <s i="31">Finally, civil society cooperation and dialogue involve activities that bring together groups of &quot;influentials&quot;, including psychologists, journalists, young politicians and students on the one hand, and thousands of children and teenagers who meet through sports, on the other.</s>
