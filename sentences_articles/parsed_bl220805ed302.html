<s i="0">The legal and economic status of Gaza after withdrawal presents difficult questions with various possible answers.</s> <s i="1">These require a short recapitulation of the recent legal history of this area.</s> 

<s i="2">Until the end of WWI the Gaza Strip, like most of the Middle East, was under Turkish rule.</s> <s i="3">From 1919 until 1948 it was under British rule, first as an occupied territory, and later as part of the British Mandate for Palestine.</s> <s i="4">During the 1948-49 Arab-Israel war, the Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt.</s> <s i="5">This situation was confirmed by the Egypt-Israel Armistice Agreement of 1949.</s> <s i="6">Egypt never annexed the Gaza Strip, and in 1962 granted it limited autonomy.</s> <s i="7">Since 1967, it has been under Israeli rule--according to most opinions, as an occupied territory.</s> <s i="8">Israel has never annexed the area, nor applied its &quot;law, jurisdiction, and administration&quot;</s> <s i="9">(the terms used for East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights) to the area.</s> 

<s i="10">In the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements of 1993 (&quot;Oslo I Accord&quot;), Israel and the PLO agreed on self-government for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, to be established in stages and to be followed after several years by negotiations on the  permanent status of the areas.</s> <s i="11">Self-government was first established in 1994 in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area.</s> <s i="12">The 1994 agreement was superseded in 1995 by the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (&quot;Oslo II Accord&quot;).</s> <s i="13">Both the 1993 and the 1995 agreements foresaw a gradual transfer of powers from Israel's military administration to the Palestinian Authority.</s> <s i="14">Israel retained mainly powers in the field of security and with regard to the Israeli settlements.</s> 

<s i="15">Both texts stipulated that &quot;the two parties view the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a single territorial unit, the integrity and status of which will be preserved during the interim period&quot;</s> <s i="16">(1995 agreement, article 31, para.</s> <s i="17">8).</s> 

<s i="18">One may perhaps describe the status of the Gaza Strip until Israel's 2005 withdrawal as an occupied territory in dispute, enjoying a large measure of self-government (some international lawyers do not agree that it is occupied territory under international law).</s> 

<s i="19">How will this status be changed by the withdrawal of Israel?</s> <s i="20">The answer depends to some extent on the question whether the Oslo accords are still in force.</s> <s i="21">Some people think that the Oslo agreements &quot;are dead&quot; because of multiple violations and because of the expiration of five years originally set as a target date for terminating the negotiations on permanent status.</s> <s i="22">This writer is of the opinion that the Oslo commitments are still valid, mutatis mutandis (i.e., with necessary changes): first of all, because none of the parties has so far formally repudiated them.</s> <s i="23">Moreover, each of the parties from time to time refers to the accords.</s> <s i="24">The 2003 roadmap established by the quartet and accepted by Israel and the Palestinian Authority also speaks of a &quot;settlement . . . based on . . . agreements previously reached by the Parties&quot;</s> <s i="25">(preamble).</s> 

<s i="26">The change in the situation of the Gaza Strip does not impair the integrity of the West Bank and Gaza--unity does not require uniformity.</s> <s i="27">Moreover, even under the original Oslo arrangements, there was no uniformity among the various areas: A, B, C, and the Gaza Strip.</s>
 
<s i="28">The drastic restriction of Israel's powers in the Gaza Strip will terminate the application of the rules on occupation.</s> <s i="29">According to international law, &quot;Territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army.</s> <s i="30">The occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised&quot;</s> <s i="31">(1907, Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, article 42).</s> <s i="32">In view of this definition, Israel should not be considered as an occupier after the withdrawal.</s> 

<s i="33">As to the question of responsibility, Israel will be responsible only in those few areas in which it may retain control, while the Palestinian Authority will be responsible in all other areas.</s>
