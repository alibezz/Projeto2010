<s i="0">One of the most disturbing byproducts of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process that began in Oslo in 1993 is the emergence of a profound perceptual gap between the Israeli Jewish majority and the country's Arab citizens regarding the future of the state of Israel.</s> <s i="1">In looking at the Israeli Arab response to the current renewal of peace negotiations between Israel and the PLO, that gap appears to be broader than ever.</s> 

<s i="2">It is not easy to recall that just a few years ago the Israeli Arab community presented itself, and was looked upon in at least some Jewish quarters, as a &quot;bridge&quot; to peace between Israel and the Palestinians represented by the PLO.</s> <s i="3">Today it is part of the problem, not the solution.</s> 

<s i="4">Worse, parts of the Israeli Arab community appear to have adopted more extreme or more strident positions than those of the Palestinian leadership with whom Israel is negotiating.</s> <s i="5">Witness, for example, the militant stand of parts of the Israeli Arab Islamist movement regarding Israel's right to exist, and their &quot;ownership&quot; of Muslim advocacy regarding the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif issue.</s> <s i="6">In particular, note the Israeli Arab mainstream's position, as enunciated in a series of position papers published in the course of the past year, rejecting Israel's identity as a Jewish state.</s> <s i="7">While the PLO/PA leadership in Ramallah refuses to acknowledge, as part of a peace process, that Israel is a Jewish state, it is not nearly as vocal as the Israeli Arab mainstream leadership in rejecting that position.</s>

<s i="8">Herein lies the primary expression of the broadening of the perceptual gap regarding Israel's future status--and the primary negative link between a renewed peace process and the Arab citizens of Israel.</s> <s i="9">In Israeli Jewish eyes, a very problematic dynamic developed in the Israeli-Palestinian sphere over the past seven years.</s> <s i="10">It featured Arab insistence at Camp David on hard-line positions regarding Jerusalem and the right of return, the outbreak of the second intifada and particularly the suicide bombings, and revelations regarding the informal &quot;return&quot; to Israeli Arab towns and villages of some 100,000 West Bank and Gazan Palestinians.</s> <s i="11">These and related developments persuaded the Israeli Jewish mainstream that the late Yasser Arafat's goal, inherited and adopted by President Mahmoud Abbas, is eventually to &quot;Palestinize&quot;</s> <s i="12">Israel.</s> 

<s i="13">As the Israeli mainstream increasingly perceives it, the Palestinian concept of a two-state solution means a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza alongside a state called Israel that is inhabited by Jews and a growing number of Palestinian Arabs who will, through natural population growth coupled with official and unofficial return, eventually be the majority.</s> <s i="14">The notion of Israel as a Jewish state, embodied in the articles of Israel's creation and particularly UNGA Resolution 181 of November 29, 1947, contradicts this direction.</s> 

<s i="15">The Palestinian leadership in Ramallah can finesse this issue while it discusses matters like security and territory with Israel, even at the cost of postponing resolution of the right of return and Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif questions.</s> <s i="16">Meanwhile, however, the mainstream secular leadership of the Palestinian citizens of Israel has in effect given notice that it can accept nothing short of Israel itself, within the 1967 borders, becoming a bi-national state.</s> <s i="17">Then it expresses bewilderment and anger at the growing popularity among the Israeli Jewish majority of initiatives, taken against the backdrop of an emerging peace process, to move the green line 1967 border so that the Wadi Ara and little triangle regions with their large Arab populations become part of a future Palestinian state, or proposed laws to demand loyalty oaths from Israeli Arabs.</s>

<s i="18">I most emphatically do not support those initiatives.</s> <s i="19">But I am trying to understand where they come from.</s> <s i="20">When FM Tzipi Livni suggests that a two-state solution could offer Israeli Arabs a Palestinian national identity, she is not trying to be provocative in a negative sense.</s> <s i="21">Rather, she is responding to what many Israeli Jews perceive to be a growing need of Israeli Arabs to identify with Palestinian nationality even as they remain Israeli citizens and a national minority in a Jewish state.</s> <s i="22">Israeli Jews didn't invent this idea: Palestinian citizens of Israel did.</s>
