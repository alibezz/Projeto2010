<s i="0">On paper, Palestinians can't complain about the content of US President George W. Bush's recent speech calling for an international peace conference to address the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</s> <s i="1">After years of denial, Bush finally agreed that resolution of the conflict is important to the region and the world.</s> <s i="2">He supported the Arab peace initiative and responded to Arab demands that the conflict be resolved in the context of an international conference.</s> <s i="3">He also reiterated his call for a viable and contiguous Palestinian state.</s> 

<s i="4">Bush even used the word &quot;occupation&quot;.</s> <s i="5">He called for the removal of the &quot;illegal&quot;</s> <s i="6">(in Israeli terminology) settlement outposts and emphasized the need to stop the expansion of settlements.</s> <s i="7">And although there was nothing new financially in what is being offered to Palestinians, the fact that monies will be transferred directly to the Palestinian Authority and not through NGOs opens the way for others to support the PA directly.</s>

<s i="8">But while in principle the president's speech was perfectly acceptable in Palestinian eyes, the same can be said of speeches, initiatives and official US declarations since 1967.</s> <s i="9">The problem, now as before, is in finding a way to implement the fine words that can penetrate the political and physical obstacles Israel will throw in their way.</s> <s i="10">All the time while Israel was ignoring past initiatives and the political will for implementing them was found wanting, Israel quietly continued its illegal settlement-building process ensuring that future plans would collide even harder with the reality on the ground.</s>

<s i="11">The latest reality on the ground has come about in part as a result of a misguided Palestinian belief that the world community--if not Israel--would respect the results of free and fair elections.</s> <s i="12">Now, unfortunately, when Bush talks about a two-state solution, Palestinian black humor understands it as being about the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and the Fateh-controlled West Bank.</s> <s i="13">Talk of any future confederation with Jordan has been replaced in the jocular with a potential West Bank-Gaza confederation.</s> <s i="14">The US and its allies are choosing a time when Palestinian support for a two-state (Israel and Palestine) solution has been gradually eroding, to express its determination to reach such a goal, even if difficult issues like Jerusalem and the status of Palestinian refugees are not on the table and were not mentioned in Bush's speech.</s>

<s i="15">While content is of utmost importance, a major stumbling block has long been process.</s> <s i="16">Over the years the step-by-step approach has proved a major failure and the concept of gradualism with benchmarks and timelines has backfired miserably.</s> <s i="17">A radical Jewish Israeli chose to assassinate PM Yitzhak Rabin and put an end to his peaceful intentions before a strategic Israeli decision in 1995.</s> <s i="18">Radical Islamic organizations have similarly timed their dramatic attacks to occur just before major events--whether they be Israeli elections in 1996 or various planned Israeli redeployments.</s> <s i="19">And instead of the parties to the conflict identifying the intentions of these radicals, the opposite happened and peace processes were suspended, thus allowing radicals their victory.</s>
 
<s i="20">What is needed is a reversal of the traditional peace process.</s> <s i="21">If a new process is going to work, it must begin with the end game and then work its way toward implementation.</s> <s i="22">After 40 years of occupation, the idea that progress can be achieved with goodwill gestures such as tiny prisoner releases and the removal of a few checkpoints is wildly misguided.</s>
