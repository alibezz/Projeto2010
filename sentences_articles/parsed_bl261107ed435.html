<s i="0">It was a mistake to arrive in Annapolis without agreement on at least one of the core issues: borders, Jerusalem and refugees.</s> <s i="1">I certainly hope that this lacuna neither weakens Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and the pragmatic group under his leadership nor strengthens Hamas, contributing to an outbreak of violence.</s> <s i="2">I hope this is the beginning of an intensive process that leads to peace agreements with Syria and the Palestinians--by exploiting the final year of Abu Mazen's presidency, the desire of the US administration to leave behind some sort of diplomatic legacy in its last year and the appeal by Syrian President Bashar Assad to initiate unconditional negotiations with Israel.</s>

<s i="3">It is the task of US President George W. Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Abbas to ensure that the Annapolis conference, which currently has no objective rationale, becomes a success.</s> <s i="4">That means the immediate convening of an Israeli-Palestinian forum alongside an Israeli-Syrian forum, along the lines of what transpired following the Madrid conference in 1991.</s>

<s i="5">What happened in the course of recent weeks repeated a well-known syndrome: the parties approach a moment of truth, get cold feet and decide this is not yet the real moment of truth.</s> <s i="6">After Olmert and Abbas had appeared to find a common language and succeeded in overcome obstacles, it emerged that the &quot;professional&quot; teams headed by FM Tzipi Livni and Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) regressed light years into the past and got &quot;stuck&quot; at inexplicable corners--like the Israeli demand that Israel be recognized as a Jewish state before the two parties had even reached agreement and the Palestinians' response of resolutely rejecting what they themselves had accepted unilaterally in the Palestinian National Council decision of 1988 in Algiers.</s>

<s i="7">After Annapolis, Olmert and Abbas, with or without the assistance of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, will have to maneuver their negotiating teams out of the corners and steer them back to a serious discussion of permanent status.</s> <s i="8">The negotiators' points of reference already exist--the Clinton parameters, the Ayalon-Nusseibeh document and the Geneva initiative--and should enable them to reach agreement within a few months.</s>

<s i="9">Negotiations with the Palestinians must be daily and continuous.</s> <s i="10">They can be held as in the past in the United States or in the region, in a neutral country.</s> <s i="11">But they must not continue in the format of recent months--in Israel alone, and for a few hours a week.</s>

<s i="12">Negotiations with Syria presumably cannot be held in the US; the best venue might be Turkey.</s> <s i="13">The drawback of this track is American doubts and reservations, while its big advantage is the existence of a partner capable of both signing and implementing an agreement.</s> <s i="14">In contrast, the advantage of negotiations with the Palestinians is that the US is very interested, while the drawback is the need to separate the signing of an agreement from its implementation and to condition the latter on the Palestinian Authority's security capability as determined by the US.</s>

<s i="15">Is this an imaginary scenario?</s> <s i="16">Not necessarily.</s> <s i="17">If the two partners understand that they have nothing to lose; if they appreciate the negative significance of postponing a solution to a distant date; if they comprehend the tremendous opportunity that has been created at this strange and hard historical juncture, with Hamas controlling the Gaza Strip; and if they grasp that their broad publics long for peace and an end to violence and overwhelmingly support any peace agreement delivered by their leaders--then they can accomplish in 2008 what has not happened for the past 40 years.</s>
