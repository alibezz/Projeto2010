<s i="0">The Iraq Study Group, or Baker-Hamilton report, is not for the most part about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</s> <s i="1">Rather, it is a last-ditch attempt to generate new American policies in the Middle East that can somehow avoid a tragic US defeat in Iraq.</s> <s i="2">By the by, it acknowledges that the diverse conflict situations in the region are linked and suggests a series of policy initiatives in the related conflicts that might positively influence America's situation in Iraq.</s> <s i="3">In so doing, it gets not only the linkage wrong, but also the recipe for progress between Israelis and Palestinians.</s>

<s i="4">The ISG asserts that, &quot;the United States will not be able to achieve its goals in the Middle East unless [it] deals directly with the Arab-Israeli conflict&quot;.</s> <s i="5">Thus it buys wholeheartedly into the theory that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the source of much of the unrest in other parts of the Middle East.</s> <s i="6">We witnessed similar assertions in recent weeks by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and British PM Tony Blair.</s> <s i="7">The latter, incidentally, went so far as to tell an audience in Pakistan that an Israeli-Palestinian peace would reduce jihadi terrorism there!</s>

<s i="8">There can be little doubt that peace or even the rudiments of an active peace process between Israelis and Palestinians would be beneficial for the Middle East as a whole.</s> <s i="9">Nor do Israelis and Palestinians need the incentive of reducing jihadi terrorism in Pakistan in order to apply themselves to solving their conflict.</s> <s i="10">But would the mess in Iraq look any different today if, three years ago, the Arab-Israel conflict had not existed?</s> <s i="11">Would Lebanon?</s> <s i="12">Would Iran have ceased to develop nuclear weapons, seek regional hegemony or support Hizballah?</s> <s i="13">There is simply no basis in fact or regional logic to support this approach, which gratuitously accepts the most handy Arab excuse for avoiding democratization and for not confronting the region's real problems.</s>
 
<s i="14">&quot;The United States&quot;, notes the report, &quot;does its ally Israel no favors in avoiding direct involvement to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict&quot;.</s> <s i="15">There is merit to this statement, which in Baker's case is based on the successful attempt back in 1991 to bring Israel and its neighbors to Madrid, where a peace process was launched.</s> 

<s i="16">But the report ignores at its peril the heavy contrast between America's status in the region then (victory over Iraq and &quot;pax Americana&quot; in the post-Cold War Middle East) and now (failure in Iraq and in virtually every other avenue of American endeavor in the region).</s> <s i="17">Its writers seem to believe that if they just list the all too obvious issues the conflicted parties have to talk about and call for &quot;sustainable negotiations&quot;, the fragmented leadership in Gaza and Ramallah and the mafia-like Assad family in Damascus will salute and comply.</s> <s i="18">In fact the Iranians, Syrians, Hamas and Hizballah appear to view the report as confirmation that they have won the day against America.</s> <s i="19">Witness the statement two days ago in Tehran by the ostensibly &quot;moderate&quot;</s> <s i="20">Palestinian PM Ismail Haniyeh: &quot;Iran is our strategic depth&quot;.</s>

<s i="21">To be fair, Baker and Hamilton focus not only on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but on the conflict with Syria as well.</s> <s i="22">Yet they ignore the more compelling logic of reverse linkage: under current circumstances, with the Palestinian Authority in disarray and no viable Palestinian partner for Israelis to deal with, it makes sense to focus on Israeli-Syrian negotiations first, insofar as success in reducing Damascus' support for Hamas would render Israeli-Palestinian talks more productive.</s> 

<s i="23">The ISG report offers a compelling description of the sad state of the US occupation of Iraq today.</s> <s i="24">Yet its most troublesome aspect is that it willfully refuses to probe into the sources of the American fiasco in Iraq and to apply the lessons of that failure to prioritizing the United States' vital interests there for the future.</s> <s i="25">Thus the report never asks: Was trying to democratize Iraq a mistake?</s> <s i="26">Was the enfranchisement and legitimization of the pro-Iranian Shi'ite militias that today effectively rule the country a good idea?</s> <s i="27">Was it a smart American move to strengthen Iran and turn Iraq into a potential member of the Iranian orbit, the &quot;Shi'ite crescent&quot;?</s>
