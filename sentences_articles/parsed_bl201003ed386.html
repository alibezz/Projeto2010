<s i="0">The current Israeli-Palestinian conflict appears to touch on issues of morality on at least two levels.</s>

<s i="1">The primary dimension concerns the morality of targeting civilians.</s> <s i="2">The arguments are familiar.</s> <s i="3">Israel, its supporters, and many in the West--particularly the United States--contend that there is a substantive and moral difference between its insistence on deliberately targeting only terrorists and its efforts to avoid injury to Palestinian civilians, on the one hand, and the readiness of Palestinian terrorist organizations to target Israeli civilians, on the other.</s> <s i="4">In reply, Palestinian terrorists frequently argue that, in effect, all Israelis are past, current or future soldiers; or they claim that, as the weaker side militarily, they have no alternative.</s>

<s i="5">By and large, I believe that the distinction between Israeli and Palestinian attitudes toward targeting civilians places us on the cutting edge--regarding moral values--of a war of civilizations.</s> <s i="6">This argument characterizes not only Israel's war, but that of the United States as well, in confronting Islamic radical suicide terrorists who deliberately target American and other civilians.</s> <s i="7">But it has to be tempered with due consideration for topical and tactical factors.</s> <s i="8">Beyond everything else, here in Israel/Palestine we all know that eventually we are going to have to find a way to live with one another as neighbors, no matter what the moral legacy of war in the eyes of each side.</s>

<s i="9">This brings us to a second dimension of ethics and morality: what is and is not permissible in the public debate and in non-governmental activities concerning the war.</s> <s i="10">In Israel we have two striking recent examples.</s>

<s i="11">First, several weeks ago 27 Israel Air Force pilots, most of them not even in active reserve duty, published a statement alleging that the IAF was in fact not maintaining its own standards for avoiding civilian casualties.</s> <s i="12">The IAF, the pilots alleged, had in effect crossed the line and was knowingly and willfully endangering civilians in its efforts to target terrorists in crowded urban areas, primarily in the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="13">Most of the Israeli public, and nearly the entire security establishment, rejected the protest, and argued that such a blanket and public refusal to obey orders was a violation of the military code; many also deemed it an unethical politicization of the military (the pilot protesters also argued against the occupation) and an unhealthy precedent for soldiers with right wing sympathies who might in future disobey orders to dismantle settlements.</s> <s i="14">But because IAF pilots are held up as an elite corps, it was clear even to many angry critics that this group of &quot;refusalists&quot; could not easily be ignored: they were sending a message to the public about the country's morals that at least had to be given due thought and consideration, and that might be more important than the protesters' decision to ignore the legal niceties.</s>

<s i="15">The second Israeli example is the so-called &quot;Geneva agreement&quot; to end (at a virtual level) the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that was reached last week by Yossi Beilin, Yasser Abed Rabbo and their supporters and colleagues.</s> <s i="16">Leaving aside for the moment an analysis of the agreement's contents (which can only be undertaken seriously once they are released to the public), many of its detractors in Israel argue that it was somehow immoral, unethical, or even illegal for a group of Israeli citizens who oppose their government's policies to draw up a &quot;virtual&quot; peace agreement with the Palestinian enemy.</s> <s i="17">It is also alleged that it was improper for foreign governments, led by the Swiss, to engage in financing and sponsoring such an endeavor.</s>

<s i="18">It is relatively easy to refute the protests regarding the legality or morality of Beilin's action: Beilin is a politician, and all's fair in (Israeli) politics.</s> <s i="19">Likud politicians, when out of power, hold secret meetings with our Arab neighbors in an effort to influence election results, and brazenly lobby in Washington against Labor government policies.</s> <s i="20">Beilin, who has registered a number of unofficial agreements with senior Palestinian leaders over the years, some when Labor was actually heading the government, would also presumably argue that his is the only effective way to move the process forward, and that the goal of Israeli-Palestinian peace justifies his tactics.</s> <s i="21">Besides, Beilin made little effort over the past two years to hide what he and Abed Rabbo were trying to do; the protests emerged only when he succeeded in delivering an agreement.</s>

<s i="22">This brings us, in conclusion, full circle to the issue of moral differences between Israeli and Palestinian society.</s> <s i="23">Beilin (or Ami Ayalon, coauthor of another, shorter, formula for peace) never asked Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for permission.</s> <s i="24">But his Palestinian counterparts to agreements over the years were in all cases emissaries of leader Yasir Arafat.</s> <s i="25">Indeed, in some 15 years of track II diplomacy with Palestinian counterparts, I have rarely met one who did not acknowledge that, one way or another, Arafat or his senior lieutenants were in the picture and sanctioned the meetings.</s> 

<s i="26">One can, of course, argue about Arafat's motives in directly or indirectly controlling these contacts: advancing peace, fragmenting the Israeli polity, &quot;knowing&quot; the enemy, maintaining his dictatorial grip--or perhaps all of the above.</s> <s i="27">But the pilots' protest and the Geneva agreement are first and foremost hallmarks of Israel's open and vibrant civil society.</s> <s i="28">Prime Minister Sharon, who values public consensus regarding his policies, has no alternative but to take notice.</s> 

<s i="29">It is hard to find parallels in Palestine, where the &quot;moral&quot; argument usually consists of the blanket determination that Israel is morally in the wrong and Palestine in the right.</s>
