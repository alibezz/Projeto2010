<s i="0">Here in the Gaza Strip, we sit and wait for the next Israeli bomb.</s> <s i="1">People feel that the next assassination of their leaders and fighters and the civilians that happen to be standing next to them is imminent--perhaps arriving this very moment.</s> <s i="2">At the same time, there is a sense of terrible disappointment at the chasm that opened wide within the Palestinian Authority between President Yasser Arafat and former Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas.</s> <s i="3">These things appear to have no end in sight.</s>  

<s i="4">Inside Hamas, the movement is resolute to continue its attacks, since it sees no let-up from Israel, and the hudna (truce) or an alternative political process no longer exists.</s> <s i="5">Instead, they see Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon exploiting the delicate situation to heighten his attacks.</s> <s i="6">In particular, Hamas was bitterly angry at the targeting of the home of Hamas political leader Mahmoud Zahhar, when Israeli F-16s dropped a half a ton of explosives on his house, killing women and children in the attack.</s> <s i="7">So unless there is a way opened for Hamas to talk about a new hudna, it seems very likely that we are now descending into a situation of revenge and dramatic escalation.</s>

<s i="8">It is not that Hamas is unprepared to consider the current stage carefully.</s> <s i="9">Sometimes its leaders heed international considerations.</s> <s i="10">They don�t want to be accused of being the reason for tension or the downfall of the government.</s> <s i="11">Hamas has several times offered to craft a political agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), but has not yet succeeded in reaching compromise with the factions that make up that organization.</s> <s i="12">And Hamas continues to fear a peace process or a crackdown from the Palestinian Authority.</s> <s i="13">The road is open for discussion with the Authority, but both sides have their reasons for being wary of a final pact.</s> 

<s i="14">It will not be easy to get out of this deep crisis, but the simplest route lies in Israel�s hands.</s> <s i="15">All it would take would be an Israeli declaration of intent to end the occupation and a moratorium on all kinds of attacks, aggression and control that it now wields over our heads.</s> <s i="16">But as we have learned through the Zinni and Tenet proposals, the Mitchell plan and the hudna, short-term compromises will not succeed.</s> <s i="17">Indeed, they are a waste of time and effort and push us to the breaking point of promises lost in the wind.</s> 

<s i="18">The way out for the Palestinian Authority is just as clear: there should be no negotiations with Israel until there is a settlement freeze, a halt to the construction of the wall, and the release of the prisoners.</s> <s i="19">This must be a serious commitment.</s> <s i="20">That was Abu Mazen�s problem; he didn�t stand a chance.</s> <s i="21">He was deceived so many times by those in Israel who promised him this and that honest gesture of good faith, but none materialized.</s> <s i="22">To facilitate this new strategy, the Palestinian Authority should collect all of the Palestinian factions under one umbrella to speak in one voice and react as one body.</s> <s i="23">Only then can we form a new unified force against the occupation.</s> <s i="24">Otherwise, these continuing disputes between Abu Mazen and Arafat, or Hamas and Fateh, or Hamas and the Authority, are an invitation to Sharon to attack a divided cause and reassert the military occupation against the Palestinian people.</s>

<s i="25">Yes, the situation is very complicated.</s> <s i="26">It would be beneficial for the United States to exert pressure on Israel to stop its aggression, in particular to prevent the deportation of Arafat.</s> <s i="27">But the truth is that we don�t even feel the US glancing our way.</s> 

<s i="28">At this critical juncture, all options remain open: for an escalation of violence or a return to negotiations.</s> <s i="29">But we should not think that Prime Minister-designate Ahmad Qurei will deliver the answers.</s> <s i="30">He will face the exact same obstacles from Israel, the US, Arafat and the Fateh Central Committee that were the undoing of his predecessor.</s> <s i="31">He will face the very same trials.</s>
