<s i="0">The relationship between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) can best be described as a tragedy of political weakness.</s> <s i="1">On the one hand, there has never been such proximity of opening positions and such lack of personal animosity and mistrust between Israeli and Palestinian leaders.</s> <s i="2">On the other hand, each side's capacity to reach a sustainable long-term deal appears as remote as ever.</s>

<s i="3">When Olmert succeeded the ailing Ariel Sharon on January 4, Israel was at the apogee of its unilateral policy vis-a-vis the Palestinians.</s> <s i="4">Sharon's disengagement from Gaza won global admiration and proved that Israel was willing and able to confront its rejectionists, the settlers.</s> <s i="5">A vocal advocate of deep West Bank withdrawal for demographic reasons--preserving Israel's Jewish majority and identity over a smaller territory--Olmert set out to follow in his predecessor's path.</s> <s i="6">While paying the requisite lip service to a negotiated process based on the roadmap, Olmert has clearly favored going it alone.</s> <s i="7">He proposed drawing Israel's long-term eastern border along the security barrier while removing the settlements outside its perimeter and maintaining a security presence along the Jordan Rift Valley.</s> 

<s i="8">Three weeks after Olmert's takeover, Hamas won the PA legislative elections.</s> <s i="9">From Olmert's perspective, this represented both a threat and an opportunity.</s> <s i="10">A hostile political force had taken charge of the Palestinian government, but this could convince the international community that Israel's unilateral strategy was justified precisely by the lack of a Palestinian partner.</s> <s i="11">Olmert successfully recruited international support against the Hamas government, and sought to topple or seriously cripple it through economic and political boycott.</s> 

<s i="12">Abu Mazen played a key role in this strategy: as long as there was a &quot;good&quot;</s> <s i="13">Palestinian interlocutor, even in a diminished political capacity, there was a visible alternative to Hamas.</s> <s i="14">Strengthened by American, European and Egyptian support, Abbas has clung to his pro-negotiations, anti-terror stance while seeking a modus vivendi with Hamas.</s> 

<s i="15">Olmert, however, abiding by an old rule of Israeli politics, distanced himself from Abbas: first, to win the March 28 elections, then to form a new coalition and then to establish his credentials with key world leaders.</s> <s i="16">His meeting with Abu Mazen had to wait, Olmert explained, until he concluded a round of handshakes in western and Arab capitals.</s> <s i="17">He met Abbas only briefly in Petra, hugged him and promised to meet him again soon.</s> 

<s i="18">Alas, the foot dragging killed the momentum.</s> <s i="19">The cross-border attack from Gaza on June 25 in which Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was abducted prompted an Israeli invasion of Gaza.</s> <s i="20">This was followed in mid-July by another abduction and full-scale war in Lebanon.</s>

<s i="21">The fighting in Gaza and Lebanon has had a quadruple effect.</s> <s i="22">First, it destroyed Olmert's unilateralism, as Israel returned to areas it had evacuated only several years before.</s> <s i="23">Second, it crippled Olmert's political stance, forcing him to seek a new agenda to survive.</s> <s i="24">Third, it brought Hamas closer to sharing power with Abbas' Fateh in order to fend off mounting pressure.</s> <s i="25">And fourth, it prompted Israel and Hamas to talk indirectly about exchanging prisoners and resuming the ceasefire.</s>

<s i="26">These developments have brought Abbas back to center stage.</s> <s i="27">He could serve Israel as an interlocutor, both as a substitute for unilateral moves and as a go-between with Hamas.</s> <s i="28">Indeed, Olmert was quick to portray Abu Mazen as a new hope rather than a hopeless weakling as before.</s> <s i="29">Olmert now said that he had wanted all along to release prisoners as a gesture to Abu Mazen, but had to postpone it because of the Shalit abduction.</s> <s i="30">Knowing the penchant of western leaders for any expression of Israeli-Palestinian dialogue, Olmert welcomed Tony Blair in Jerusalem with the promise of meeting Abbas &quot;without preconditions&quot;.</s> <s i="31">Last week, Israeli ministers Tzipi Livni and Shimon Peres met Abbas at the United Nations.</s> <s i="32">Olmert's long-delayed meeting with Abbas is now pending the sorting out of Palestinian unity government deliberations and resolution of the Shalit prisoner deal.</s> 

<s i="33">Despite the mutual need for a political helping hand, however, little can be expected from the Abbas-Olmert meeting.</s> <s i="34">Both leaders' ability to deliver on key issues is strictly limited by their domestic troubles.</s> <s i="35">Olmert's adherence to the roadmap first-phase requirement of a Palestinian crackdown on terror and his firm demand that any Palestinian government recognize Israel serve as impediments to any quick progress.</s> <s i="36">At the same time, the current Israeli government is too weak to perform its own roadmap obligations, such as removing settlement outposts.</s>
