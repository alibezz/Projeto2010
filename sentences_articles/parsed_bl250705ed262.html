<s i="0">Ariel Sharon's disengagement plan has an important side effect.</s> <s i="1">It forces the Israeli and Palestinian governments to tackle their respective rejectionists.</s> <s i="2">Last week, as Israel's police and military forces blocked the settler march toward Gush Katif, the Palestinian Authority's security organs confronted their Hamas rivals in Gaza.</s> <s i="3">For both sides, it has been an important new development.</s>

<s i="4">The lack of domestic confrontation was a major weakness of the 1990s Oslo process.</s> <s i="5">Successive Israeli governments preferred to nurture the settlements and turn a blind eye toward expressions of settler lawlessness rather than curbing the settlement enterprise.</s> <s i="6">At the same time, the PA allowed the development of militias and terrorist groups that took the lead after the outbreak of hostilities in September 2000, instead of imposing &quot;one law with one gun&quot;.</s> <s i="7">Both sides recognized the extremist danger following Yitzhak Rabin's assassination and the subsequent wave of Palestinian suicide bombings in Israeli cities.</s> <s i="8">But their efforts to rein in rejectionist elements were short-lived and, in retrospect, failed to change the dynamics of a crumbling peace process.</s> <s i="9">It became more convenient for the two sides to fight one another.</s>

<s i="10">Sharon's disengagement offers a fresh opportunity for Israelis and Palestinians to put their houses in order.</s> <s i="11">Its unilateral nature frees Sharon and his Palestinian counterpart, Mahmoud Abbas, from the need for mutual compromise and quid-pro-quos.</s> <s i="12">It provides a time out from serious negotiations, which should be used for consolidating power and legitimacy through new elections to both parliaments, expected several months after the Gaza withdrawal.</s> <s i="13">The negotiations impasse resolves the inherent contradiction between electoral needs that dictate tougher positions on outstanding issues, and diplomatic demands that mandate mutual concessions.</s>

<s i="14">Disconnecting withdrawal from diplomacy allows the Palestinians and Israelis to keep their blame game going without jeopardizing the main effort of settlement evacuation.</s> <s i="15">Sharon and Abbas are able to hold totally opposing views regarding the way forward on &quot;the day after&quot;--with Abu Mazen calling for a quick move to final status negotiations, which Sharon would like to avoid indefinitely--without halting the current movement.</s> <s i="16">Under the umbrella of pending disengagement, Israel has gained badly needed international applause, while Abbas has become the new hope of American Mideast policy.</s>

<s i="17">This delicate balance was seriously shaken by the renewed eruption of violence, beginning with the Netanya suicide attack of July 12.</s> <s i="18">For several days, it appeared as if the war was back.</s> <s i="19">Nevertheless, Abbas and Sharon managed the gravest crisis of the post-Arafat era successfully.</s> <s i="20">With American and Egyptian assistance, they preventing the fire from spreading, focusing instead on dealing with their domestic opponents.</s>

<s i="21">The violence brought American Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice back to Jerusalem and Ramallah, to ensure that Sharon's withdrawal is implemented as planned and to promote Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.</s> <s i="22">International public opinion favors summit meetings over unilateral dictates, and America is no exception.</s> <s i="23">Criticized at home for lack of involvement and for giving Israel virtual control over regional policy, Rice prodded Sharon to meet Abbas, but he balked.</s> <s i="24">Her aides explained later that &quot;disengagement coordination&quot; is in fact &quot;negotiations&quot; and announced a coming agreement on removing the rubble from demolished settler houses in Gaza.</s> <s i="25">They apparently failed to notice any irony in the fact that the peace process had been reduced to negotiations over rubble.</s>

<s i="26">Rice's main concern was a Hamas takeover of post-evacuation Gaza.</s> <s i="27">She called on Israeli leaders to prevent this by strengthening Abbas through security assistance and freedom of movement in and out of Gaza.</s> <s i="28">But at the end of the day, she had very little leverage over Sharon.</s> <s i="29">Given the poor state of the Bush administration's policies elsewhere in the Middle East, Israel's premier appears as the best candidate to deliver credible results.</s> <s i="30">This allows Sharon to be the eventual arbiter on Israeli-Palestinian matters.</s>
