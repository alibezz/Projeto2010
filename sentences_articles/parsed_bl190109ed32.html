<s i="0">The Gaza war rendered an Israeli-Palestinian two-state peace agreement more difficult and more distant.</s> <s i="1">And it probably changed the incoming American president's order of priorities in ways the government of Israel--both this one and the next one--will have to adjust to quickly and flexibly.</s>
<s i="2">The Israel-Arab-related issues that Barack Obama will face upon assuming the presidency now begin, unexpectedly, with the ugly unfinished business of Gaza.</s> <s i="3">The efforts being made to ensure that rockets and other ordnance can no longer be smuggled into Gaza have yet to bear fruit.</s> <s i="4">It is lamentable that it took an ugly war to prod Egypt and the international community--led by the United States, which signed a memorandum of understanding with Israel in this regard on the eve of Obama's presidency--into acting on this issue.</s> <s i="5">But nothing has happened yet, and if Obama wants to avoid another round of fighting in Gaza, he will have to ensure that the effort succeeds.</s>
<s i="6">By the same token, there is only a temporary ceasefire in and around Gaza, the IDF is still deployed inside the Strip, and the Gaza passages remain closed to all but humanitarian aid.</s> <s i="7">Here too, the road to renewal of the fighting is short.</s> <s i="8">One way to ensure that the ceasefire holds is for Obama to reevaluate the heavy restrictions that Israel and the Quartet, with Egyptian and PLO support, placed a year and a half ago on contact with Hamas and on open commerce with Gaza.</s> <s i="9">This war demonstrated that Hamas, even if (hopefully) defanged, is here to stay.</s> <s i="10">Obama, the new leader on the block, is well situated to effect a new departure with regard to engaging Hamas--just as he intends to engage Iran and Syria--and opening the Gaza-Israel passages to commerce, thereby reversing a foolish and counter-productive policy.</s>
<s i="11">The Gaza post-war humanitarian situation, too, will need Obama's attention.</s> <s i="12">As matters currently stand, the provision of western aid--intended not only to help Gazans rebuild but to counter Iranian aid and influence--requires a PLO presence in Gaza, which Hamas may or may not be persuaded to concur with.</s> <s i="13">This issue may dovetail with Egypt's hopes to bring Hamas back into unity government talks with Abbas' PLO.</s> <s i="14">If those talks succeed, they could within the year produce new Palestinian elections that Hamas might win, thereby putting paid to any near-term aspirations to negotiate a two-state solution.</s> <s i="15">Those who speak approvingly of &quot;Palestinian unity&quot; should now beware of what they wish for.</s>
<s i="16">The conventional wisdom in some quarters holds that the Gaza war will oblige Obama to award the Israeli-Palestinian peace process higher priority on his Middle East &quot;to do&quot; list than he originally might have intended.</s> <s i="17">I doubt it.</s> <s i="18">Obama will quickly discover that the war weakened Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen).</s> <s i="19">And Israel's Feb. 10 elections are liable to produce a new Israeli government less interested in removing settlements and negotiating a final status agreement than its predecessor or, if interested, no more capable.</s>
<s i="20">Meanwhile, Syria beckons.</s> <s i="21">The prospects for a Syria-Israel peace process weathered this war well; the only casualty may have been Turkish mediation, reflecting the vociferous anti-Israel pose struck during the war by Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</s> <s i="22">If the ranks of militant Islam in the Middle East were struck a blow in this war by the damage done to Hamas and by Hizballah's refusal to open a second, northern front, a successful Israeli-Syrian peace process would make a far larger contribution by blunting Iran's drive for hegemony in the Levant, weakening Hizballah, contributing a quiet Syrian-Iraqi border to facilitate a US withdrawal from Iraq, and removing Hamas' headquarters from Damascus.</s> 
<s i="23">This would be good for Obama's Iran and Iraq agendas and, by weakening Hamas, good for his Israeli-Palestinian agenda.</s> <s i="24">Of course, success with Syria and Israel is far from a certainty.</s> <s i="25">But it is definitely more feasible under current circumstances than success with Abu Mazen and the next Israeli government.</s>
