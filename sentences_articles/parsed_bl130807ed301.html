 <s i="0">The regular biweekly meetings of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert have received a mixed reaction from both Palestinians and Israelis.</s>

<s i="1">Most of the criticism on the Palestinian side falls into two categories.</s> <s i="2">One reaction is that once again a Palestinian leadership is building up hope that relies on the good will of Israel and the United States, countries that were never receptive to the legitimate rights of the Palestinians or even those Palestinian rights guaranteed by international legality.</s>

<s i="3">The second is that this &quot;process&quot; is completely removed from the reality the Palestinian people is living on the ground.</s> <s i="4">In other words, there is no connection between the relatively positive and optimistic atmosphere surrounding these meetings and the actual Israeli policies and practices that continue to consolidate the occupation, making life more difficult while leaving the objective of ending the occupation as distant as ever.</s> 

<s i="5">The resumption of bilateral relations at the highest political level marks a departure from Israel's catastrophic unilateral strategy and is a step in the right direction.</s> <s i="6">Notable, however, is the schizophrenic nature of the current Israeli stance vis-a-vis the Palestinians.</s> <s i="7">On the one hand, Olmert is proceeding with bilateral relations that seem to be moving, even if slowly, from the practical and physical difficulties facing Palestinians--checkpoints, prisoners, etc.--to more general political issues.</s> <s i="8">Yet on the practical level, we continue to see unilateral practices on macro and strategic issues: from the ever-expanding settlements and wall, via the deepening separation of Gaza from the West Bank to the continued fragmentation of the West Bank by a system of control that is based on the checkpoints.</s> 

<s i="9">But it is not only on the Palestinian side that the biweekly meetings--that seem to be developing into a kind of political process--are removed from reality.</s> <s i="10">On the Israeli side too there is an obvious disconnect between the political reality and these meetings.</s> <s i="11">The most recent example is last week's statement by &quot;defense&quot; minister Ehud Barak that it would not be possible to consider any kind of withdrawal for several years.</s> <s i="12">It is a statement that very much goes against the grain of the perception Olmert would like to create for these meetings.</s>

<s i="13">There is also one large ghost in the machine.</s> <s i="14">Any outcome of these meetings that is opposed by Hamas stands no chance of success.</s> <s i="15">Hamas not only is in direct control of the Gaza Strip; the Islamist movement enjoys the support of a majority of the Palestinian public in the occupied Palestinian territories as evidenced by the 2006 elections.</s> 

<s i="16">The biweekly meetings have to take into account the political realities on both sides.</s> <s i="17">And while in and of themselves they mark a step forward, they should be accompanied by constructive public debates.</s> <s i="18">The fact that the political aspects of the meetings are neither made public nor based on any measurable level of consultation at the leadership level will only leave the Palestinian side weak, dependant and vulnerable, just as it was during the secret and non-consultative Oslo negotiations.</s>
