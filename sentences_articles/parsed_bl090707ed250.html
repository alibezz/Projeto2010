  <s i="0">The idea of deploying international forces in Palestine to ease tensions and violence with Israel is yet again being bandied about.</s> <s i="1">The difference this time is the response by all parties.</s> <s i="2">It used to be an idea that Israel rejected and Palestinians promoted.</s> <s i="3">Now the Palestinians, unsurprisingly, are divided and the Israelis are hesitant.</s> 

<s i="4">The idea of international peacekeeping forces was always encouraged by the peace camps in Palestine and Israel because it is consistent with their approach and the kind of solution they are after, namely one based on international legality, including the relevant UN resolutions.</s> <s i="5">International forces would, as part of their remit, serve to monitor the behavior of the parties, and since Israeli practices in the occupied territories are always in contradiction with these laws, Israel has always avoided such a third party role.</s> 

<s i="6">Hamas, still in the grip of euphoria after taking over Gaza by force, feels that anybody else with authority will reduce its control there.</s> <s i="7">Hamas is only at the beginning of its mission in Gaza, and Hamas fears international forces because the international community considers President Mahmoud Abbas and his government to be the legitimate leadership of the Palestinian people and therefore is in opposition to the Islamist movement's current illegal position.</s> 

<s i="8">Israel opposes the idea for very similar reasons, namely its hostile attitude toward international legality.</s> <s i="9">That is simply because international law contradicts the Israeli occupation and consequently disapproves of Israeli practices in occupied territory, especially the settlement policy that serves to consolidate the occupation.</s> 

<s i="10">But this is based on the assumption that any international forces will be mandated by the international community and the UN, or at least that their remit will be consistent with the laws and resolutions of the UN.

The possible change in the Israeli position is that Israel might approve some kind of international presence in Gaza alone on the premise that the Strip is no longer occupied territory.</s> <s i="11">Israel opposes any international presence in the West Bank because in the Israeli definition, the West Bank was never occupied.</s> 

<s i="12">Such differentiation must be completely rejected by the international community as well as the Palestinians.</s> <s i="13">Accepting an international presence in Gaza and not in the West Bank will only play along with the Israeli strategy of separating the West Bank from Gaza.</s> <s i="14">Not only that, it will have no chance of being accepted by Gazans, especially Hamas.</s> <s i="15">One of the biggest mistakes made in Oslo on the Palestinian side was accepting different statuses for the different parts of occupied territory.</s> <s i="16">The West Bank is as much in need of an international presence as Gaza, if not more.</s> 

<s i="17">Furthermore, Israel must not be allowed to remain selective as far as international law and the role of the international community are concerned.</s> <s i="18">In Lebanon for example, Israel is urging the international community to help impose relevant UN resolution.</s> <s i="19">But UN resolutions are suddenly very unpopular when in a Palestinian context.</s> 

<s i="20">The recent consensus on the failure of Israeli unilateralism and the fact that the neo-cons in the US are taking a back seat, in an implicit admission of the failure of neo-con strategy, might provide new opportunities.</s> <s i="21">It is time for Europe to take a leading role, because it has already been promoting the alternative to the failed Israeli-American approach.</s>

<s i="22">If an international peacekeeping force is deployed, it must have a clear mandate from the UN and international law must be its guiding principle.</s> <s i="23">Otherwise, such a force will not be able to play a constructive role but might rather be caught in the conflict instead of solving it.</s>

<s i="24">The absence of a clear mandate and terms of reference will also confuse the mission.</s> <s i="25">Should it prevent only Palestinian violence or also Israeli?</s> <s i="26">Should it stop only the illegal activities of armed Palestinian groups or also the activities of the illegal settlers?</s>
