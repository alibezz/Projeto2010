<s i="0">Education, especially in the Middle East, has been a major tool for long-term change, as it affects the attitude and behavior of younger generations and the future.</s> <s i="1">The nations of the Middle East are young by international standards due to a persistently high reproduction rate.</s> <s i="2">For this reason, processes like education that affect the younger generation have great influence, and the relatively weak traditions of democracy and respect for due process allow populism to gain unusual significance.</s> <s i="3">Populism, in turn, thrives on an active young generation and can be influenced a great deal through the schooling process.</s> 

<s i="4">For all of these reasons, education is a sphere of intense competition between the various groups in the Middle East.</s> <s i="5">Many parties are actively trying to use education to build a peaceful and stable region, propagate values of democracy or spur economic rejuvenation.</s> <s i="6">The pursuit of these worthy agendas demands our attention and new educational efforts.</s> <s i="7">At the same time, this pursuit will only be possible if our new generations are hooked into the international agenda through the process of globalization in its most positive manifestations, i.e. by benefiting from international advancements, while at the same time maintaining a sense of cultural individuality and uniqueness.</s> 

<s i="8">The problem here is that these groups and their agendas do not have a monopoly on outreach to the regionï¿½s youth.</s> <s i="9">Education is also widely used to forward the agendas of traditional forces in power in most Middle Eastern countries.</s> <s i="10">The ideology of Islamic extremism is one expression of these traditional forces.</s> <s i="11">Blind anti-globalization (rejecting change for the sake of rejecting it) is another expression of the traditional mindset.</s> <s i="12">Certainly, regional detachment from recent significant technological and scientific developments has been the worst outcome of such closed ways of thinking and shortsightedness.</s>

<s i="13">Here, in the peace process between Israel and the Arabs, education has been similarly misused.</s> <s i="14">New generations in Israel, for example, are taught in ways that encourage widespread racist attitudes and practices among Israelis about Arabs and Palestinians.</s> <s i="15">(We all know these myths, which pitch the ignorant Palestinian peasant against the brave, pioneering Israeli settler or the defeated Arab army against the tiny Jewish militia--never mind the superpowers that Israel had on its side).</s> <s i="16">The Israeli official account of recent history plays on these stereotypes and thus prevents tolerance and mutual understanding--both of which are crucial to coexistence.</s> 

<s i="17">It is only thanks to recent writings by Israel's &quot;new historians&quot; that traditional Israeli education has come under scrutiny and subsequently challenged.</s> <s i="18">To base political pursuits on exclusivist historical and religious beliefs that give rights to only one party is the route to prolonging this conflict, not ending it.</s>
