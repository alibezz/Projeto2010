<s i="0">The two-state solution is still possible but time is running out.</s> <s i="1">Man-made developments on the ground and internal politics in both Israel and Palestine are working against it.</s> <s i="2">Based on the assumption that a Palestinian state is only possible by peaceful means, the actions of Israel and the international community are a major factor in determining its viability.</s>

<s i="3">The two-state solution became a visible, realistic and widely recognized notion when the Palestinians changed their strategic political thinking from demanding their rights to historic Palestine to pursuing a solution to the conflict based on international legality.</s> <s i="4">The rationale behind this was the belief that such a solution was not only possible, but it was acceptable to and even desired by the international community.</s> <s i="5">Moreover, regardless of the way it was created and the injustice this inflicted on the Palestinian people, Israel had become a reality that had to be taken into consideration in any realistic Palestinian vision of the future.</s> 

<s i="6">The two-state solution subsequently became the main concept of President George Bush senior when he convened the international peace conference in Madrid in 1991.</s> <s i="7">It is imbedded in countless United Nations resolutions and remains the guiding philosophy behind the roadmap.</s> 

<s i="8">Bur what was more important at the time was that there were no competing strategies or solutions.</s> <s i="9">Everyone, except Israel, recognized the existence of two people competing for the same land.</s> <s i="10">The logical solution would be to divide the land, especially since such a concept was rooted in international law with the very creation of Israel.</s> <s i="11">In fact, it was a condition for the creation of Israel, as stipulated in the partition plan of 1947, UN Security Council Resolution 181.</s> <s i="12">The borders are now envisaged to be the 1967 armistice lines simply because there is no other basis for alternatives.</s> <s i="13">Any deviation from this would leave the issue to the balance of power between the two sides, something clearly unacceptable to the Palestinian side.</s> 

<s i="14">The peace process sparked by Oslo created the impression that such a solution was possible.</s> <s i="15">More than that, from a Palestinian prospective the peace process was about ending the occupation and establishing a Palestinian state in return for peace.</s> <s i="16">By the same logic, the difficulties that started to mount against the process indicated the challenges facing the prospect of a two-state solution.</s> 

<s i="17">Indeed, after the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by a Jewish terrorist, hope for such a solution started gradually to evaporate.</s> <s i="18">But the real knock-out blow came not with any act of violence but with international acceptance of Ariel Sharon's unilateral policy and President George Bush junior's &quot;strategy&quot; of abandoning Middle East peace efforts.</s> <s i="19">The American change of approach was interpreted by Sharon as a signal to go ahead and impose the future by force.</s> 

<s i="20">The unilateral strategy is a supreme challenge to the two-state solution, predicated as that solution it is on bilateral negotiations between the two parties to arrive at a just solution.</s> <s i="21">If Israeli unilateralism is not stopped and reversed very soon, the two-state solution will cease to be viable.</s> <s i="22">Israeli polices and practices have been undermining the viability of a Palestinian state for years now, first and foremost by fragmenting the Palestinian territory--separating not only the West Bank from the Gaza Strip, but West Bank areas from each other in a maze of settlements, settler-only roads, walls, checkpoints, concrete and barbed wire.</s>
