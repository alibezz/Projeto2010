<s i="0">There seem to be two schools of thoughts among Palestinian politicians and analysts regarding the coming elections in the United States.</s> <s i="1">Some, including President Mahmoud Abbas and the head of the negotiating delegation, Ahmed Qurei, believe that this last year of President George W. Bush is a year of opportunity that must not be wasted.</s> <s i="2">Others, including Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, are convinced that no progress can be expected in the Palestinian-Israeli political process before a new administration has settled in.</s>

<s i="3">However, all of the above agree that the coming elections in the US are crucial for a troubled Middle East in general and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in particular.</s> <s i="4">This is especially true in light of the evident interaction between the different political trends and conflicts in the Middle East.</s>

<s i="5">The main cause of hope regarding the American elections for the people of the Middle East, especially Arabs, is the same as for Americans, namely change.</s> <s i="6">It is difficult for Arabs to believe anything but that US Middle East policy in the past seven years has been the worst, most damaging ever.</s> <s i="7">In parallel, this period coincided with the lowest level of credibility granted to any American administration.</s> 

<s i="8">So what is the message to the next administration?</s> <s i="9">The most urgent one, based on past experience, is this: engage.</s> <s i="10">Whenever Palestinians and Israelis are left to their own devices, their relations deteriorate.</s> <s i="11">When the current administration abandoned the diplomacy of the preceding one, what was left was the balance of power between the two sides.</s> <s i="12">This favors Israel to the extent that the country has little motivation to move seriously toward peace, leaving Palestinians little option but to resist and complain.</s> <s i="13">What leaving the two sides alone does not achieve is confidence and an atmosphere conducive to peace-making.</s> 

<s i="14">Serious and sustained American and international engagement is the only way to improve hopes for a peaceful and negotiated solution and reverse the growing support for radical forces that promote violent and unilateral approaches to ending the conflict.</s> 

<s i="15">Having engaged, a new US administration must influence the behavior of the two sides in such a way that neither acts outside the agreed terms of reference of a solution, i.e., a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders, a division of Jerusalem into two capitals and a fair resolution to the Palestinian refugee problem.</s> 

<s i="16">In this regard the current situation is untenable.</s> <s i="17">While the international community continues to support a two-state solution, practices on the ground contradict such a goal.</s> <s i="18">Israel continues expanding its settlements on occupied territory and especially in Jerusalem, while the division between the West Bank/Fateh and Gaza/Hamas is undermining hopes for a single Palestinian polity.</s>
