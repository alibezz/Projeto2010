<s i="0">Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is waging what has become known as a &quot;peace offensive&quot; on several fronts.</s> <s i="1">The Turkish government is mediating talks between Israel and Syria about a possible Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights while Egypt brokered a ceasefire (tahdiyeh) in the Gaza Strip with Hamas and other Islamic and nationalist Palestinian movements.</s> <s i="2">The ceasefire should include the West Bank in the next six months and has already survived a week of violations.</s> 

<s i="3">The US, meanwhile, is attempting to solve the problem of Lebanon's Shebaa farms, which are occupied by Israel and where the demarcation of a border with Syria is a necessary step.</s> <s i="4">And in the latest move, Israel approved a German-mediated prisoners' swap with Hizballah.</s> 

<s i="5">In addition, the official Palestinian track has witnessed several high profile meetings.</s> <s i="6">Olmert has repeatedly received Mahmoud Abbas at his residence in Jerusalem while Israel's foreign minister Tzipi Livni and chief Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qurei have spent many hours negotiating, apparently in the spirit of much ado about nothing.</s> <s i="7">No breakthrough has been reached and no final status issues solved in spite of the fact that the Bush administration wants a Palestinian state by the end of this year.</s> <s i="8">Resolving the Palestinian issue remains the cornerstone of peace in the region and beyond.</s>

<s i="9">The November Moscow conference, if it takes place, should create some balance in negotiations.</s> <s i="10">This is the rationale behind creating the Quartet.</s> <s i="11">Israel is still suspicious and antagonistic toward any serious role by the Quartet, except the US.</s> <s i="12">The latter has just issued invitations to the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to Washington for tripartite negotiations.</s>

<s i="13">There are political analysts that interpret Olmert's feverish political maneuvers with Israel's neighbors as an attempt to neutralize important regional allies of Iran before an attack on the latter's nuclear facilities.</s> <s i="14">The consequence of such an attack would dwarf the Iraqi disaster.</s> <s i="15">The whole Gulf region would suffer tremendously, with deep repercussions for the world economy and stability.</s> <s i="16">Yet on the other hand, and in what might be considered a &quot;peacetachio&quot; move, Israel has just enriched the Iranian treasury with US$20 million for Iranian pistachios.</s> <s i="17">It would have been easier to interpret this business transaction had it been an established fact that nuts prevent wars.</s>

<s i="18">There is another plausible scenario to explain the intense Israeli political activities that have taken place lately.</s> <s i="19">Olmert wants to divert the Israeli public's attention away from his personal problems.</s> <s i="20">Israeli opposition leader Binyamin Netanyahu subscribes to this position; he considers the talks with Syria &quot;a ruse by Olmert to divert attention away from the probes&quot; against him.</s>

<s i="21">Exactly one month ago, Olmert was under pressure to resign or take leave from office, while under investigation for receiving money from American financier Morris Talansky.</s> <s i="22">This case, which is far from over, is not the first time he has been under public and state scrutiny, but this time it is a close call; the case reached Attorney General Mazuz who has to decide whether to indict or not.</s> 

<s i="23">Ehud Olmert stated that he would not resign unless indicted.</s> <s i="24">But in any case, his tenure as prime minister was not expected to last this long.</s> <s i="25">His days as a prime minister were thought numbered in the aftermath of the Winograd report that found that Olmert shouldered the primary responsibility for Israel's failure in the 2006 war on Lebanon.</s> <s i="26">The report depicted him as someone who made decisions without systematic consultations with relevant bodies, &quot;despite not having experience in external-political and military affairs&quot;.</s>

<s i="27">Furthermore, he is leading a fragile coalition government.</s> <s i="28">Members of his cabinet blackmail him politically (Shas demands child welfare payments and expansion of the Beitar Illit settlement in order to stay, while Yisrael Beitenu resigned in protest at the start of negotiations with the Palestinians).</s> <s i="29">He was threatened by members of his cabinet not to include Jerusalem in the final status negotiations and responded by saying that the city would stay under Israeli rule.</s>
