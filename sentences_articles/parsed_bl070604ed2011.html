<s i="0">Egypt's involvement in the search for a way out of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis is growing.</s> <s i="1">Egyptian interest in the disengagement plan initiated by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has not faltered despite the bitter political struggle over the plan within the Israeli government.</s> <s i="2">Nor did it diminish even when Palestinian spokespersons objected to the pressures exercised by their Egyptian ally on the Palestinian leadership and to Egypt's undisguised interference in the internal affairs of the Palestinian Authority.</s>

<s i="3">The angry political discussion taking place in Israel between the pro and anti-disengagement camps is seen by Cairo as an internal Israeli affair.</s> <s i="4">Of course, Egypt's involvement is not intended to aid the government of Israel, and certainly not its head.</s> <s i="5">Sharon was and is anathema to most of the Egyptian public and its leaders.</s>

<s i="6">Rather, Egypt's growing involvement is a direct consequence of the assessment of the government of President Husni Mubarak concerning the grave Middle East situation generated by both the turmoil in Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation.</s> <s i="7">The two crises feed upon one another, and together nourish regional instability.</s> <s i="8">The Israeli-Palestinian crisis has become brutal, and its prolongation increasingly threatens the vital national interests of additional Arab states--first and foremost Egypt and Jordan, which border on the conflict.</s> <s i="9">Daily reports of heavy Palestinian casualties have a cumulative effect on Egyptian public opinion.</s> <s i="10">Anger directed at Israel, as well as at United States activities in Iraq, frequently also takes the form of sharp criticism of the neglect exercised by the Egyptian authorities.</s> <s i="11">This emanates today not only from the traditional opposition, but from spokespersons identified with the Egyptian public mainstream.</s>

<s i="12">Under a heavy screen of diplomatic niceties, the Egyptian leadership believes that the Bush administration's Middle East policies are at fault, and may even be exacerbating the situation.</s> <s i="13">But the complex nature of the ties between the two countries dictates caution on the part of the Mubarak government, in order to avoid a crisis in its relationship with Washington.</s> <s i="14">Cairo well appreciates that this relationship is also being tested.</s> <s i="15">Hence its involvement in advancing an Israeli-Palestinian settlement is part and parcel of Egypt's overall policy toward the only superpower.</s>

<s i="16">Egypt's role at this stage is also facilitated by the unique approach it has taken to the Palestinian Authority since the crisis began in the fall of 2000.</s> <s i="17">For years Egypt consistently and successfully cultivated its status as patron of the PA and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.</s> <s i="18">It took upon itself a variety of tasks at various stages of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.</s> <s i="19">Not everyone was happy with the Egyptian performance.</s> <s i="20">Sharp criticism, rarely justified, emanated from both Israel and the US, alleging that Egypt avoided playing a significant role in ending the conflict, or even thwarted the process.</s> <s i="21">(The critics ignored the fact that neither Israel nor the US offered the Mubarak government a role that would correspond with Egypt's political agenda.) Jerusalem and Washington argued that Egypt's decision not to exercise its full influence on the Palestinian leadership was one of the causes of the failure of final status negotiations.</s> <s i="22">Egypt rebuffed these accusations, and maintained a constant dialogue with Arafat and his advisers, even as Israel and the US claimed that the Palestinian leader was no longer relevant and constituted an obstacle to peace.</s>

<s i="23">True, on a number of issues Egypt took issue with the Palestinian leadership.</s> <s i="24">Mubarak and his emissaries have called for changes in the PA, including a decentralization of the authority held by President Arafat.</s> <s i="25">But the two actors remain in agreement regarding the strategic objective of a two-state solution along the June 4, 1967 borders.</s> <s i="26">The Egyptian leadership played the &quot;Arafat card&quot; deftly; hence it now has the opportunity to play an instrumental role in the Israeli-Palestinian crisis.</s>

<s i="27">The decision to increase its involvement in the conflict undoubtedly strengthens the standing of the Mubarak regime as a force for moderation and stability in the otherwise threateningly unstable Middle East.</s> <s i="28">The cultivation of this image, along with the commitment to peace with Israel, remains a constant guarantee for the ongoing flow of intensive and vital external aid to Egypt.</s> <s i="29">But this was not an easy decision for the authorities in Cairo.</s> <s i="30">There is considerable concern lest Egyptian forces in Gaza be drawn into the eye of the storm and sustain casualties.</s> <s i="31">On the other hand, public opinion is liable to regard a limited Egyptian force in the Gaza Strip as a vanguard; if the violence there continues, this could strengthen the voices of those who have already demanded that a more significant force be dispatched to protect the Palestinians--thereby possibly precipitating the kind of unprecedented crisis with Israel that Egypt has successfully avoided over the years.</s>

<s i="32">In the complex reality of today's Middle East, any new initiative can be influenced by an infinite number of factors.</s> <s i="33">Will Sharon's disengagement plan be carried out in the end?</s> <s i="34">Will it indeed generate a renewal of the political process, or, God forbid, escalate the conflict?</s> <s i="35">Will the leaders of the two belligerent sides, and particularly Arafat, contribute to stabilizing the situation?</s> <s i="36">Only the answers to these and additional questions will tell us the nature of the local and regional ramifications of the unprecedented Egyptian involvement in seeking a solution.</s>
