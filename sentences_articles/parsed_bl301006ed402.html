<s i="0">When we sat down in Stockholm in the summer of 1994 for the first discussion of what emerged more than a year later as a joint proposal for a permanent settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, we deliberated with two representatives of Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) over the question: how to begin.</s> 

<s i="1">In principle, two contradictory concepts were available.</s> <s i="2">One states that the two sides should first jointly define the goal, the end-game, and then fill the agreement with content.</s> <s i="3">The second argues the necessity of reaching agreement on every issue from point zero and building a process from the ground up.</s> <s i="4">At the territorial level it means that the ruling party, Israel, dictates a basic assumption: that the territory occupied in 1967 is not guaranteed in its entirety to a future Palestinian state and that its sovereignty is disputed.</s> 

<s i="5">That was the option chosen by PM Ehud Barak in the Camp David II negotiations.</s> <s i="6">From his standpoint, the Palestinians had no &quot;case&quot; for demanding 100 percent of the West Bank.</s> <s i="7">Accordingly, negotiations circled the issue without determining that in principle the Palestinian state would be established through the implementation of UNSC Resolution 242 and on the basis of the Egyptian precedent whereby all territories were exchanged for peace.</s>

<s i="8">In Stockholm, where we encountered this same dilemma, our conclusion was clear: if we want to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, we have to concur from the start that the Palestinian state will be established on all of the territory.</s> <s i="9">This is the Palestinians' basic incentive for an agreement, and from this point of departure we should negotiate the details.</s> <s i="10">Such a negotiating framework needed to be based on an additional set of understandings: that the agreement must deliver security to Israel, that the border would take into account certain Israeli demographic interests and that Israel could not make concessions regarding the Jewish nature of the state.</s>

<s i="11">On this basis, during the preliminary phase of the negotiations over the Beilin-Abu Mazen agreement we took an additional step that helped stabilize the talks.</s> <s i="12">Following upon the understanding regarding the territorial aspect, we sought to examine the nature of relations that we would like to see after peace in the areas of economy, security, culture and border regime.</s> <s i="13">Only after jointly constructing the future environment to which we aspired did we begin to get into the details.</s>

<s i="14">This approach succeeded.</s> <s i="15">Four days before the assassination of PM Yitzhak Rabin we produced a draft that could have constituted the basis for a peace settlement.</s> <s i="16">But Rabin was murdered without ever seeing the draft.</s> <s i="17">Five years later, the Israeli delegation to Camp David operated on the opposite principle: Ehud Barak refused to accept Abu Mazen's proposal to base negotiations on the principle of the 1967 lines and, according to some, doomed the negotiations to failure.</s>

<s i="18">Since that painful failure, and with the exception of a brief episode half a year later that involved the Clinton parameters and the Taba negotiations, it has been difficult for the two sides to effect a new departure.</s> <s i="19">Worse, with the passage of time the lack of mutual trust deepens, with many now assessing that the gap has become unbridgeable.</s> <s i="20">Personally, I don't accept this assumption.</s> <s i="21">Yet it appears that for the two sides, and especially for Israel, it would now be easier to accept an external proposal from the international community--one that would of course be accompanied by strategic assurances.</s>

<s i="22">Under present circumstances, and given the nature of the current political leadership on both sides, it would be difficult to recreate an official negotiating framework based on the Oslo concept.</s> <s i="23">The Israeli side and some on the Palestinian side are more likely to try for an interim agreement that does not even close the territorial file.</s> <s i="24">The Oslo experience, in the course of which both sides abused the agreement's lack of clarity regarding an absolute, defined objective and ended up in violent conflict, proves that in order to reach a solution we need a clear vision of reality.</s> 

<s i="25">Today, unlike in the past, the vision of reality with regard to a settlement acceptable to a majority on both sides is almost completely clear.</s> <s i="26">Accordingly, a UN Security Council decision with strong American support would constitute a significant catalyst for a permanent status peace treaty if it replaced 242 and determined that a peace agreement would create a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders with equal territorial swaps in areas not exceeding, say, three percent of the territory.</s> <s i="27">Such a proposal need not comprise a precise delineation of the border, which should be determined through bilateral technical negotiations.</s>
