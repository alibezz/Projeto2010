<s i="0">In completely objective, totally detached terms there is a really great Palestinian policy available in the aftermath of Hamas' seizure of the Gaza Strip.</s>

<s i="1">Palestinian Authority and PLO leader Mahmoud Abbas and his Fateh-dominated government in the West Bank could present their people with an attractive alternative.</s> <s i="2">Cease terrorism, really purvey moderation (as an actual policy and not just in interviews with western correspondents) and make a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel to create a Palestinian state with its capital in east Jerusalem.</s> <s i="3">Huge amounts of aid are pledged internationally, the Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip is isolated, and everybody--outside of the Gaza Strip at least--lives happily ever after.</s>

<s i="4">Sounds good.</s> <s i="5">But of course it isn't going to happen even though one might well argue that it &quot;should&quot; happen.</s> <s i="6">And the reason it won't happen is not due to anything Israel and its government thinks, says or does.</s>

<s i="7">It isn't going to happen for reasons that should be, but sadly aren't, obvious to anyone.</s> <s i="8">Abbas is still weak and passionately committed to the return of Palestinian refugees to Israel, a sign of bad intentions and a deal-killer in itself.</s> <s i="9">The PA is still incompetent and corrupt.</s> <s i="10">Fateh is still in love with extremism, most of it deeply committed to total victory and Israel's destruction and wedded to terrorism and violence as its principal tactics.</s> <s i="11">To a large extent, Fateh is still Hamas without the Islamism.</s>

<s i="12">Is this terrible shock of humiliating defeat enough to begin a transformation into something else?</s> <s i="13">It should be, but it is rather doubtful that Palestinian politics work that way.</s> <s i="14">After all, this was hardly the first humiliating defeat, exactly of the kind that outside observers keep predicting will bring change.</s> 

<s i="15">Indeed, that concept was precisely the one at the root of the failed peace process that only brought more war and suffering.</s> <s i="16">Remember, it was Arafat's backing for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the cutoff of Arab aid to the PLO and the defeat of Iraq that were supposed to provide the humiliating defeat and near-death that would make Fateh and the PLO become moderate.</s> <s i="17">And in the end, it was the peace process itself that brought disaster.</s> 

<s i="18">This dose of reality brings us to Plan B. Forget about grandiose plans and don't be intoxicated with wishful thinking.</s> <s i="19">It is in the common interest of the West, Israel and certainly Fateh itself to keep the current regime in power in the West Bank.</s> <s i="20">(Of course, this is premised on the reality that there is nothing better available as an alternative since there is no real moderate force of any importance in Palestinian politics.) The problem is whether Fateh will once again act in a suicidal manner, a pattern that has characterized its history.</s> 

<s i="21">What is needed is limited cooperation based on practical issues.</s> <s i="22">The message should not be: &quot;Let's save that wonderful moderate Abbas who is eager for peace.&quot;</s>  <s i="23">But rather: &quot;Mr. Abbas and colleagues, you are on the verge of extinction.</s> <s i="24">Give us some reason to save you if you want our help.&quot;</s> 

<s i="25">The way this issue is being presented in Washington and Jerusalem, however, would make one believe that Abbas is so wonderful that he is doing everyone a favor by accepting their money and support.</s> <s i="26">Such a fantasy will lead to a continuation of Fateh's habitual blindness and smugness, guaranteeing its intransigent behavior and eventual downfall.</s>

<s i="27">Aid should be contingent.</s> <s i="28">Stop incitement in the PA media that Abbas controls, act decisively to stop cross-border attacks, and on that basis help can be provided.</s> 

<s i="29">One of several elements of chronic stupidity in forming Middle East policies also to be factored in here is the response to enemies that are sure to seek to sabotage those policies.</s> <s i="30">No doubt, Hamas and Islamic Jihad will redouble their efforts to launch terrorist attacks on Israel in order to sabotage Abbas' survival.</s> <s i="31">If Israel and the United States are patronizing about this--poor guy, he just cannot help it--the situation will spiral into a new catastrophe.</s>

<s i="32">It is for Mr. Abbas' own good that he be held accountable.</s> <s i="33">He must clamp down on the terrorists (including members of his own group) and the incitement that makes people become suicide bombers or get the same treatment that Hamas receives.</s>

<s i="34">And that brings us to another key element of strategy.</s> <s i="35">Hamas, which Abbas now himself labels as terrorist, must be isolated, denied aid, and treated severely.</s> <s i="36">If, after all, the West coddles and seeks engagement with Hamas, this would show Palestinians and other Arabs that the Hamas way works and one can have an anti-Jewish charter, terrorism and intolerant Islamism along with success and western acceptance.</s> <s i="37">If that is true, who needs Abbas and Fateh?</s>
