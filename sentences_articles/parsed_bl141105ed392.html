<s i="0">Yasser Arafat died a year ago; Yitzhak Rabin ten years ago.</s> <s i="1">Both signed the Oslo accords and (with Shimon Peres) received the Nobel Prize for Peace.</s> <s i="2">Both died tragically.</s>

<s i="3">The comparison ends there.</s> <s i="4">The contrasts begin.</s>

<s i="5">Arafat's death seemingly produced little outpouring of grief among Palestinians or his fellow Arab leaders.</s> <s i="6">While he was charming in person, Arafat was mainly corrupt and manipulative, too prone to rely on violence, developed too few strategies for building a viable Palestinian state, and had a disastrous inclination to fall back on lies and paranoid fantasies not seen in any successful Arab leader.</s> <s i="7">A year ago, the impression was that much of the Middle East, not to mention the rest of the world, breathed a sigh of relief when he died.</s>

<s i="8">From the perspective of a year's distance, Arafat deserves historic credit for coalescing a scattered people and giving it a cause.</s> <s i="9">But he could not figure out how to exploit that success.</s> <s i="10">He missed the boat in 1978 when he turned down the first Camp David offer of autonomy, in territories then devoid of settlements.</s> <s i="11">Later, his ten-year stint at state-building was a fiasco; millions are still suffering for his mistakes.</s> <s i="12">Alone among the twentieth century national liberation movements, his failed.</s> <s i="13">He died sordidly and inexplicably, and nobody really seems to care.</s> <s i="14">His death appears to have had nothing to do with whether he succeeded or failed in his life's mission.</s>

<s i="15">Yitzhak Rabin, on the other hand, knew when and how to change strategies.</s> <s i="16">He had his faults and drawbacks, but he pointed us in the right direction, and we are, willy-nilly and with a lot of zigzags, still on that course of defining ourselves as a Jewish and democratic state and letting the Palestinians go their own way.</s> <s i="17">While he adamantly refused to present a detailed vision of a two state solution, Rabin nevertheless made sure everyone knew in what direction he was heading.</s> <s i="18">In person he was diffident, ill at ease, not particularly communicative, even (as one of his ministers once described him to me) &quot;autistic&quot;.</s> <s i="19">But he was genuine, authentic and straightforward.</s> <s i="20">His assassination ten years ago left most Israelis and others worldwide in shock and heartache; many continue to exhibit their strong feelings for him to this day, often to the extent (particularly on the political left) of distorting his legacy.</s> <s i="21">Even most of those who, for political and ideological reasons, don't miss him, nevertheless recognize the huge setback to Israeli sovereign state-building that his murder constituted.</s>

<s i="22">Rabin and Arafat first met in that excruciating handshake on the White House lawn on September 13, 1993.</s> <s i="23">Rabin was not a dissembler, and everything about his body language told you he knew exactly whom he was dealing with.</s> <s i="24">I remember at the time asking another retired IDF general, a comrade-in-arms of Rabin, whether he had watched that ceremony.</s> <s i="25">&quot;I couldn't,&quot; he replied.</s> <s i="26">&quot;I knew what Yitzhak was going through and couldn't bear to see it.&quot;</s> 

<s i="27">Had he lived, I doubt very much that Rabin would or could have made a genuine peace with Arafat.</s> <s i="28">But that is merely informed speculation, based partly on the limitations of Rabin's vision in his day, but mostly on Arafat's performance in the ensuing years until his death.</s> <s i="29">Still, Rabin's assassin succeeded in causing real damage to the cause of peace and coexistence.</s>

<s i="30">Arafat's successor, Mahmoud Abbas, is a good man engaged in a dangerous experiment with Hamas, seemingly without the leadership qualities needed to tame even violent supporters within his own movement, Fateh.</s> <s i="31">He confronts an Israeli leader, Ariel Sharon, who subscribes to Rabin's strategy of separation but not to his formula for a viable relationship with the Palestinians.</s> <s i="32">And while Rabin and Arafat had the benefit of President Bill Clinton's stewardship and commitment, we now have President George W. Bush, mired knee-deep in a disastrous Iraqi adventure and barely able (or ready) to lend us the services of Secretary of State Rice for a day every few months.</s>
