<s i="0">The loss of Ariel Sharon's leadership is a blow to the cause of additional Israeli unilateral withdrawals, demographic sanity and the narrowing of the military occupation on the West Bank.</s> <s i="1">Only after Israel's elections of March 28 will we begin to know how well Sharon's successor as prime minister--presumably, though not certainly, Acting PM Ehud Olmert--manages these tasks.</s> 

<s i="2">Clearly, Olmert is committed to further withdrawal.</s> <s i="3">Indeed, he proposed it, citing the demographic argument and the danger of falling into a South Africa model, a year before Sharon.</s> <s i="4">In this regard, he may have more strategic understanding than his predecessor, who was essentially a master at tactics, both military and political.</s> <s i="5">But clearly, too, Olmert has none of Sharon's credentials as a warrior hawk, nor his charisma, his grandfatherly image and teflon coating, nor his incredible determination and thick skin in the face of terrible odds.</s> <s i="6">And he is relatively untried in the tasks of an Israeli prime minister.</s> <s i="7">Despite his decades of political experience, Olmert was never minister of defense or foreign affairs, has never worked with Washington on major strategic issues and has never managed negotiations with the Palestinians.</s>

<s i="8">Israeli-Palestinian relations will almost certainly present him with more pressing challenges than disengagement in the immediate post-Sharon era.</s> <s i="9">Sometime in the coming days Olmert may have to decide whether, and how, to allow Palestinian Jerusalemites to vote in the January 25 Palestinian national elections.</s> <s i="10">Avoiding a decision could place the onus of cancellation of those elections on Israel.</s> <s i="11">US administration emissaries David Welch and Elliot Abrams, who were on their way here to find a solution in consultation with Sharon when he became incapacitated, have postponed their trip.</s> <s i="12">Olmert may need more than American help if he is to navigate this pressing issue without losing electoral support or doing damage to Israeli-Palestinian relations.</s> <s i="13">As mayor of Jerusalem for a decade prior to 2003, he largely ignored the needs of his Palestinian residents.</s>

<s i="14">Yet even the Jerusalem vote question may pale in the coming weeks--if the authority of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) continues to falter in the face of internal violence and anarchy inflicted largely by his own Fateh supporters, and if Hamas wins the January 25 elections, or even gains decisive veto-power within the Legislative Council.</s> <s i="15">Many Israelis and friends of Israel will have a knee-jerk inclination to blurt out, &quot;Arik would have known what to do&quot;.</s> <s i="16">Will Olmert know?</s> <s i="17">Has he internalized the two key rules of policy behavior that Sharon learned so well after the debacle of the 1982 invasion of Lebanon: coordinate closely with Washington, and maintain public consensus in support of your policies?</s> <s i="18">Does he have a realistic vision of a viable two-state solution--something Sharon never had?</s> <s i="19">Can he, or anyone else on the political scene, for that matter, replace Sharon's powerful presence with something equally compelling and perhaps less destructive?</s>

<s i="20">Sharon's removal from the scene suggests a second troublesome cluster of immediate crises that Olmert may have to deal with.</s> <s i="21">We saw an inkling of it after Sharon's first, minor stroke, when Palestinian militants in Lebanon with an al-Qaeda link launched katyushas into Kiryat Shmona, Gazan militants aimed their Qassam rockets at Ashkelon and radical settlers set up a dozen new outposts.</s> <s i="22">Now we may see a heavier display of provocations against Israel on the part of all those extremist elements in the region, often egged on by Syria and Iran, that are inclined to interpret Sharon's sudden departure as a sign of Israeli weakness.</s> <s i="23">Inevitably, most of these provocations--Qassams, outposts, suicide bombings and who knows what else--will generate tensions at a time when both Israelis and Palestinians need a little peace and quiet to get their respective houses in order.</s>

<s i="24">Sharon's entire approach to the Palestinian issue evolved significantly during his premiership.</s> <s i="25">But it took two years in office, fighting the intifada, before he discovered, in the words of the popular song he liked to quote, that &quot;things you can see from here you can't see from there&quot;.</s> <s i="26">Only then did he begin to come to grips with the limitations of force, the counterproductive nature of the occupation, and the demographic threat, and bought into the public's overwhelming advocacy of the fence and disengagement.</s> 

<s i="27">Olmert, seemingly, has a head start because he learned these lessons before Sharon.</s> <s i="28">But any leader who takes over from Sharon has a hard act to follow.</s> <s i="29">Israelis and Palestinians who hope in the coming weeks and months to see some sort of progress, however hesitant and one-sided, should wish him well.</s> <s i="30">The US, EU, Egypt and Jordan should help him--but without interfering in Israel's elections.</s> <s i="31">This is no easy task.-  Published 9/1/2006 &amp;copy; bitterlemons.org
