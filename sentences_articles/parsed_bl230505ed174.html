<s i="0">In this edition of bitterlemons the authors discuss to what extent the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is about land, conflicting historical narratives or a mixture of the two.</s> <s i="1">&quot;History versus Geography&quot; is the catchphrase.</s> <s i="2">Of course, it is almost always safe to say it is a mixture of the two, without having to specify the proportions.</s> 
  
<s i="3">So that there be no misunderstanding of what follows, let me state here near the beginning that I accept the State of Israel if the State of Israel accepts the State of Palestine and that I accept the Israeli state within the lines of June 4, 1967 if this state accepts a Palestinian state on the same borders, with all that such an acceptance entails.</s> <s i="4">I also realize that a solution cannot be just and therefore lasting, unless it deals with the problem of Palestinian refugees on the basis of UN General Assembly Resolution 194.</s> 
  
<s i="5">Having said this, I have two problems with the question as posed.</s> <s i="6">First, I have a problem accepting the definition of what started in Palestine around a century ago as a &quot;conflict&quot;.</s> <s i="7">The word &quot;conflict&quot; could connote disagreement, dispute or simply being at odds.</s> <s i="8">It could also connote a fight.</s> <s i="9">From my own perspective, what we have here cannot be adequately described by any of these terms.</s> <s i="10">This is not a conflict but a struggle against our displacement as a people and our extinction as a nation.</s> 
  
<s i="11">Second, I have little liking of catchphrases and even less liking of any attempt to squeeze our suffering into an appealing catchphrase like the title of this edition.</s> <s i="12">&quot;Too much history in too small a geography,&quot; it has been said.</s> <s i="13">As far as I am concerned, the history of the &quot;conflict&quot; that is making my life so difficult is only a century or so old.</s> <s i="14">The events of the last hundred years are alive in the minds of many octogenarians still among us, and are thus very much part of our life and memory.</s> <s i="15">That is the &quot;history&quot; in which I am interested and that is not much history.</s> <s i="16">Going beyond that is ideology.</s> 
  
<s i="17">I know that there are some--not a few--on each side of the divide, who deny the other totally, who have conflicting ideologies or conflicting narratives that underlie their ideologies.</s> <s i="18">If the present situation is only about them, then it is hopeless and we have a conflict that defies resolution.</s> <s i="19">However, I do not believe the situation is hopeless, and this is because I believe it should be possible to put &quot;history&quot; aside and work on a solution that is possible.</s> <s i="20">This is possible if we concentrate on the geography, invoking at the same time international law and UN resolutions.</s>
  
<s i="21">Snapshots of the map of mandatory Palestine taken at different intervals over the last century show that the area under Israeli control has been expanding and that under Palestinian &quot;control&quot; has been shrinking.</s> <s i="22">The graph of area of land under Israel as plotted against time has been rising and never had a downturn, even though it might have leveled off over short periods.</s> <s i="23">Looking at a snapshot taken at a time near the beginning, one will see that what has been going on since is a struggle by the Palestinians to retain territory to which identity is integrally linked.</s> <s i="24">The Israeli drive has been to conquer territory and erase identity.</s> <s i="25">This is the equation.</s> <s i="26">It is territorial and it is about geography.</s> <s i="27">If there is to be a compromise, it has to be on the geography, not on the history.</s> <s i="28">The most troubling aspect of the occupation is also about geography, namely Israel's settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territory.</s> <s i="29">Nothing undermined the process and impeded progress toward a settlement of the &quot;conflict&quot; more than this.</s>
