<s i="0">The big, or perhaps eternal question, is: what do the Palestinians want?</s> <s i="1">Beyond the events of the moment, beyond the headlines, the documents and the polls, beyond abductions and the response to abductions--what do they really want?</s>

<s i="2">I meet every few months with leading intellectuals from all currents of thought in the society that lies beyond the fence--and every meeting leaves me confused.</s> <s i="3">At one point, the wave they are riding is a single state for the two peoples; at another, the issue is a struggle for civil rights as in South Africa rather than a struggle for national liberation.</s> <s i="4">At yet another meeting, they revert to the classic two-state formula.</s> <s i="5">And now, in the spirit of the new Palestinian government, hudna (ceasefire) is the magic word.</s> <s i="6">Give us '67 and receive in return a hudna for 60 or 70 and even 80 years (&quot;in any case Israel won't exist longer than that&quot;).</s>

<s i="7">A hudna is better than peace.</s> <s i="8">Hudna means honoring rights.</s> <s i="9">Hudna is mutual respect.</s> <s i="10">And the land will be at peace 80 years, as in the Book of Judges.</s> <s i="11">Sounds good, doesn't it?</s> <s i="12">But wait a minute: what does '67 mean?</s> <s i="13">That we give up Maaleh Adumim or Pisgat Zeev, too?</s> <s i="14">Reconciliation that begins with the uprooting of tens of thousands from their homes--is this a good way to begin?</s> <s i="15">I ask.</s>

<s i="16">What, only we are allowed to be uprooted?</s> <s i="17">They reply.</s>

<s i="18">And if we are following this train of thought, what about the right of return, are you giving it up?</s>

<s i="19">We'll manage with '67, they reply, on condition that it comprises everything, up to David's Tower in Jerusalem, no nonsense.</s> <s i="20">We'll resettle the refugees in the meantime within these confines.</s> <s i="21">As for the future, God is great.</s>

<s i="22">And if I want to pray at the Western Wall, or the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, or prostrate myself on the tombs of the fathers on the Mount of Olives?</s>

<s i="23">With a visa, what's the problem?</s> <s i="24">To go to America you also need a visa.</s>

<s i="25">In other words, to sum up this summary, we have to forget about ending the conflict and forego everything that we were prepared to die for, in return for a ceasefire with &quot;dignity&quot;.</s>

<s i="26">Because it is not the fate of the abducted soldier that stands between us and our neighbors.</s> <s i="27">Nor is it the Prisoners' Document--yes or no? Nor even the fence.</s> <s i="28">And day by day, it is increasingly obvious that even convergence or realignment is not the issue--that even this cause, that until recently was ostensibly our heart and soul, even this fateful issue is evaporating and losing not only its magic but even, under the circumstances, its fundamental validity.</s> <s i="29">As always, what is revealed is the heart of the conflict, the stumbling block that some see as the rock upon which our very existence depends.</s>

<s i="30">What, then, do you learn from this?</s> <s i="31">What can you learn from this constant turbulence, these endless reversals?</s>

<s i="32">At the end of the day, at least on the surface, it appears as if the Palestinians want nothing.</s> <s i="33">Or, put differently, they don't want to actualize any demand.</s> <s i="34">They will always place the hurdle so that even if you stretch all your limbs you won't clear it.</s> <s i="35">You can break one record after another--Olympic, world--and never clear it.</s> <s i="36">This rule apparently also applies to negotiations over the fate of the abducted Israeli soldier in Gaza.</s>

<s i="37">Is there method to this madness?</s> <s i="38">Yes, there is, and it is simple: you don't ever forego a fantasy.</s> <s i="39">As long as it is not realized, you stick with it, with everything.</s> <s i="40">You never give up anything.</s>

<s i="41">When you stick with a fantasy you remain a child.</s> <s i="42">You don't take responsibility.</s> <s i="43">Somebody else will take care of you.</s> <s i="44">You demand, receive, ask for more, get on people's nerves, absorb a few blows and shut up, and after a brief pause demand again: the same demand as before, but with additions.</s> <s i="45">Like the balloon known as the prisoners' document, which is one of those documents launched every year or two.</s> <s i="46">Like every Palestinian document, whether originating with prisoners, refugees or pensioners, it will pay empty lip service to the 1967 borders but emphasize the right of return.</s> <s i="47">Anyone who is repeatedly astonished by this law of nature either needs a reality check or is being dishonest.</s>

<s i="48">This is not stated as a provocation to the left or to the Israeli public sector known as the &quot;peace camp&quot;, which displays this blindness.</s> <s i="49">On the contrary, it is stated in order to persuade them to look the truth in the eye and respond accordingly--change their basic approach; not lose hope.</s>
