<s i="0">Ten years ago, on the eve of the Oslo signing in Washington on September 13, 1993, it seems that we were all better off than we are now.</s> <s i="1">The first intifada was over.</s> <s i="2">The Madrid multilateral process that linked Israel with most of the region was developing.</s> <s i="3">The Gulf war of 1991 had ushered in an era of high profile American involvement and relative stability; it helped bring the Palestine Liberation Organization to the negotiating table.</s> <s i="4">There were only around 120,000 settlers in the West Bank and Gaza and that problem looked solvable.</s> 

<s i="5">The next two years maintained the trend.</s> <s i="6">Rapid progress was made in turning over territory to the PLO.</s> <s i="7">Israel and Jordan made peace.</s> <s i="8">Israel's Arab community for the first time appeared to feel a closer identity with the state.</s> <s i="9">Peace brought economic prosperity.</s> <s i="10">The president of the United States supported the process politically, diplomatically and financially to an unprecedented degree.</s>

<s i="11">In contrast, the current situation needs little elaboration: more and uglier violence between Israelis and Palestinians and inside Israel; an economy in decline; greater alienation between Jews and Arabs inside Israel; an American president whose agenda is consumed by post 9/11 issues but whose constituencies and natural inclinations apparently preclude any serious engagement here.</s>

<s i="12">The danger signs were there, of course.</s> <s i="13">Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's parliamentary (and popular) support during the years 1993-95 was fragile.</s> <s i="14">Neither he nor his successors stopped the flow of settlers, particularly to the West Bank.</s> <s i="15">Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat continued to make public pronouncements that called into question his commitment to a genuine two-state solution.</s> <s i="16">He imported corruption to the Palestinian Authority.</s> <s i="17">And he still viewed violence as a legitimate means of furthering his goals.</s>

<s i="18">With the passage of time, it is increasingly easy to point out the flaws in the Oslo Declaration of Principles and resultant peace process that contributed to this decline: over-reliance on interim phases as confidence builders; the Israeli presumption that the PLO would and could act as a subcontractor to root out Palestinian terrorism; the failure to stop settlement expansion; bad leadership.</s> <s i="19">Some of the mistakes have been rectified, however painfully, over time.</s> <s i="20">For example, Israel and Palestinian contractual reliance on United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 as the framework for final status, even though 242 was not designed as a framework for Israeli-Palestinian peace, has been to some extent supplanted by the advent of the Clinton Principles and the Saudi/Arab League Initiative.</s> 

<s i="21">The consequences of Oslo's failure for the Israeli Arab community are only now beginning to be seriously recognized.</s> <s i="22">In the words of the recently-published Orr Commission report, 

the Oslo agreement and the establishment thereafter of the governmental system of the Palestinian Authority accelerated yet further [Israeli Arab] identification with the Palestinians. . . .</s> <s i="23">[the Israeli Arab sector] became aware that the Israeli-Palestinian agreements ignore their special problems and that the concept of two states for the two peoples leaves them to their fate. . . . the political struggles waged by representatives of the Arab minority in the country underwent a process of escalation. . . .</s>  <s i="24">Palestinian identity was no longer merely an expression of solidarity with brothers &quot;outside&quot;, but became the basis for struggles &quot;inside&quot;.</s> 

<s i="25">While the Rabin government dealt forthrightly with this challenge by encouraging greater Arab integration into the Israeli socio-economic fabric, all of its successors neglected it--thereby helping usher in the tragic events of October 2000, in which 12 Israeli-Arabs and one Palestinian were killed by the Israel Police in the course of demonstrations in support of the intifada.</s>

<s i="26">As ugly as the present reality is just ten years after Oslo was signed, and with the awareness of the inevitable mistakes that were made, we now realize how far away we were then from a solution--but how much clearer its outlines are now, thanks to Oslo.</s> <s i="27">The absence in Oslo of clearly enunciated parameters of final status led the parties, however painfully, to begin to come to grips with this lacuna on their own, without a formal process.</s> <s i="28">In contrast with the vision of the Oslo negotiators, the new outlines bespeak far more separation than integration.</s> <s i="29">The Palestinians will get something close to the 1967 lines, and a capital in Jerusalem.</s> <s i="30">But there will be no return and no right of return.</s> <s i="31">And there will be a fence.</s> <s i="32">If we cannot do this through agreement, then it is imperative to invoke Israeli unilateral steps.</s> <s i="33">Beyond this, Israeli Arabs will at some point, and in some way, have to come to terms with minority status in a democratic Jewish state.</s> 

<s i="34">The outlines are clearer, yet the solution may not be nearer.</s> <s i="35">The past ten years have witnessed a Palestinian demographic victory (they will soon be a majority between the river and the sea) and Israeli geographic preemption--the inexorable spread of the settlements.</s> <s i="36">The three relevant leaders--Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and US President George W. Bush--have all failed to provide forthright leadership for peace.</s> <s i="37">Hence it is increasingly difficult with each passing day to make good on the two state solution ushered in by Oslo.</s> 

<s i="38">Soon it will be virtually impossible.</s>
