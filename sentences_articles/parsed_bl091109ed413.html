<s i="0">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' resignation only confirmed that the peace process&quot; is frozen; instead of a settlement construction freeze, we got the freezing of negotiations.</s> <s i="1">Abbas' departure reflects US President Barack Obama's failure--not to put heavy pressure on Israel, but rather the other way around: the pressure on Israel created the dynamics that led ultimately to the deep freeze.</s>

<s i="2">It was only natural that Abbas didn't want to return to the negotiating table.</s> <s i="3">He reached a certain point in the last round with the heads of the former Israeli government, Ehud Olmert and Tzipi Livni, and he wanted to continue from that point where the two sides left off.</s> <s i="4">This is the nature and dynamics of negotiations.</s> <s i="5">As an alternative, he was willing to forego that condition and sit down to negotiate under a new one: a freeze on settlement construction.</s> <s i="6">Here he was in agreement with Obama, who told Abbas in his first visit to the White House that the Israeli prime minister had heard things there that no Israeli had heard before: demands on Israel first, and the pressure shifting from the Palestinians to Israel.</s>

<s i="7">Abbas of course could not demand less than the American president.</s> <s i="8">But instead of a settlement freeze we got a negotiations freeze.</s> <s i="9">This issue has been the subject of much discussion in the US media since the summer, with the conclusion that Obama and Secretary of State Hilary Clinton were mistaken to take that course of action.</s> 

<s i="10">Israel and the Palestinians actually invented a new genre of political negotiation.</s> <s i="11">Usually, a leadership that decides to sit down at the negotiating table, for better or for worse, cannot get up and leave the table--even if it's very sovereignty becomes a negotiable issue.</s> <s i="12">But with the advent of this new genre, a democratic country can afford and has the ability to leave the table, so to speak.</s> 

<s i="13">This might happen when there is a change of government.</s> <s i="14">This is what actually happened with the results of the last Israeli elections.</s> <s i="15">The Israeli public rejected the entire strategy of negotiating a final settlement accord with a leadership that doesn't look like it can be an equal partner with the ability to deliver on that agreement.</s> <s i="16">There is no need to elaborate on this point because it has been discussed endlessly: the Netanyahu government represents an Israeli impulse to have peace and offer considerable compromises to that end, but that same impulse rejects the peace process.</s> 

<s i="17">The &quot;peace process&quot; does not lead to peace; rather, it is a strategic and political scheme.</s> <s i="18">I heard a European diplomat on a sabbatical compare it to the process of creating NATO in the early 1950s.</s> <s i="19">The idea was to keep the Americans in, to keep the Russians out and to keep the Germans down.</s> <s i="20">Israel in the peace process scheme is dealt with for the purpose of keeping it down.</s> <s i="21">Keep Israel down--that's the conceptual idea.</s> 

<s i="22">This dynamic has generated a contrary idea, developed by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, of developing an independent Israeli policy.</s> <s i="23">Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Defense Minister Ehud Barak are in agreement.</s> <s i="24">This is Netanyahu's &quot;economic peace&quot;.</s> <s i="25">Israel is gradually adjusting itself to the notion that it is an independent economic power with great aspirations for the next decade, as was expressed by the prime minister's speech at the President's Conference in Jerusalem two weeks ago.</s> <s i="26">I believe Netanyahu's concept is that Israeli economic empowerment will create a derivative in the form of new political ideas to rearrange the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians into one of coexistence.</s> 

<s i="27">As a backdrop to this Israeli development, there are ominous developments on the international arena that mount considerable additional obstacles on the road back to negotiations.</s> <s i="28">Because of Obama's withdrawal of the American presidency into the role of &quot;transactional&quot; leadership, as a source close to the White house defined it, various sardines have been inflated internationally into sharks: Sweden, Libya, Cuba.</s> <s i="29">Together with Judge Richard Goldstone they are able to rock the Middle East boat.</s> <s i="30">Turkey can afford suddenly to show itself in full dress on the boulevard holding hands with Iran.</s> 

<s i="31">A huge storm of anti-Israel revanchism is building up.</s> <s i="32">This does not look like a road to peace; it looks like the continuation of war by other means.</s> <s i="33">The United Nations has become a tool against peace, not least because of the feeble leadership of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who has stood passively by as the Iranian-Venezuelan-Russian-Islamist coalition in the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly have kidnapped this supposed major international facilitator of peace.</s>
