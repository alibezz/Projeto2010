<s i="0">As best I can recall, the routine of bi-weekly meetings between PM Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas is without precedent in the annals of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.</s> 

<s i="1">Of course, a series of Israeli leaders--Rabin, Peres, Netanyahu and Barak--met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the past.</s> <s i="2">But those &quot;summits&quot; were reserved for dealing with crises, putting the final touches on agreements and signing them.</s> <s i="3">Here and there, leaders from the two sides have met in back channel deliberations designed to explore future possibilities: we recall Ariel Sharon and Abbas at Sharon's ranch, Shimon Peres and Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) when Sharon was prime minister and more recently Tzipi Livni and Salam Fayyad.</s> 

<s i="4">But the Olmert-Abbas meetings are unusual because they are official, public and are becoming routine.</s> <s i="5">Then too, they came about as the result of third party initiative and pressure--on the part of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.</s> <s i="6">Moreover, the main set of issues on the agenda of these meetings thus far has been stabilization and confidence-building measures of the sort that are usually relegated to the level of lower level advisers and officials from both sides.</s> <s i="7">More recently, we are informed that the two leaders also meet alone to discuss some sort of new declaration of principles regarding final status issues.</s>

<s i="8">Perhaps the most striking characteristic of all of the Abbas-Olmert meetings is the image of political weakness projected by the two leaders, each in his own unique political context.</s> 

<s i="9">Abbas seemed to have proven the persistent allegations that he lacks leadership qualities when, in June, he lost control over the Gaza Strip to Hamas.</s> <s i="10">He has now apparently bought into the &quot;window of opportunity&quot; theory that perceives an advantage in discussing the fate of the West Bank/Fateh alone.</s> <s i="11">But his popularity is waning, and backing from key Arab states like Egypt and Saudi Arabia is at best ambiguous.</s> <s i="12">He is betting everything on a scheme launched by the Bush administration.</s> <s i="13">Bush, after failing spectacularly in Iraq, seeks to display a modicum of progress between Israelis and Palestinians so as to reassure the rest of the Arab world regarding his future plans for the region.</s> 

<s i="14">Abbas' Israeli partner, Olmert, has a proven record of strategic miscalculation in Lebanon and tactical impotence in the West Bank, where the settlements continue to expand.</s> <s i="15">Olmert's public approval ratings are barely above ten percent.</s> <s i="16">In the eyes of many observers his days as prime minister are numbered, either because of the much anticipated final report of the Winograd commission regarding the management of last summer's war with Hizballah or due to a series of criminal investigations regarding his previous business and ministerial activities.</s> <s i="17">He has displayed considerable political skill in fending off &quot;lame duck&quot; status.</s> <s i="18">But as matters stand right now, if he doesn't resign he is almost certain to face elections in 2008 and to lose them.</s>

<s i="19">All the accumulated wisdom of the past 15 years of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations would point Olmert and Abbas toward a more modest track of confidence-building and stabilization, to be followed first by coordinated Israeli territorial withdrawals and, only at a later date, by discussions of final status issues.</s> <s i="20">Without a Palestinian leader capable of persuading his constituents to accept the tough compromises Arafat rejected at Camp David in 2000; without better functioning Palestinian institutions, especially security forces; without the support of the surrounding Arab world; without rapprochement between Fateh and Hamas; and without stronger and better Israeli leadership no final status scheme will work, even a virtual &quot;declaration of principles&quot;.</s>
