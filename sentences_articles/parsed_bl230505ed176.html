<s i="0">The central question of the Arab-Israel--or at least the Israeli-Palestinian--conflict is whether it is a &quot;normal&quot; struggle over territory or an existential battle set by religion, identity, and other factors much less susceptible to resolution through compromise.</s>

<s i="1">Many observers, drawing analogies from other issues without properly examining the specifics of the Arab-Israel case, conclude that it is a normal conflict and, consequently, can be easily settled if only the right formula is found.</s> <s i="2">In fact, though, for much of the Palestinian side the question has remained one of total victory, in which only Israel's extinction and replacement by a Palestinian Arab, and perhaps Islamic, state extending between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea is the acceptable solution.</s>

<s i="3">This is not to say that all Palestinians think this way.</s> <s i="4">Indeed, one could well argue that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and his closest allies understand how impossible and dangerous this kind of thinking is for the Palestinians themselves.</s> <s i="5">This does not mean, however, that they can change this thinking in the face of militants, gunmen, Fateh hardliners, propagandists, opportunists, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other forces.</s> <s i="6">To challenge this basic self-definition of the movement too openly or decisively would be political suicide as well as being dangerous to their personal security.</s>

<s i="7">Only the continued priority that the movement places on total victory, no matter how long it takes, rather than on getting a state and easing immediate Palestinian suffering can explain the course of events.</s> <s i="8">The ultimate failure of the 1990s' peace process was due to this orientation.</s> <s i="9">In 2000, Yasser Arafat turned down both the opening and later best offer of Israel and the United States as even a framework for a negotiation in which he would have no doubt received more.</s> 

<s i="10">The basic rejection of agreeing to end the conflict in return for an independent Palestinian state with its capital in Jerusalem is due to this view that a long enough struggle will bring about Israel's collapse and total Palestinian victory.</s> <s i="11">The same can be said of the demand for a &quot;right of return&quot; for all Palestinian refugees and their descendants, which would give a tremendous opportunity to subvert Israel from within.</s> <s i="12">In private conversations, and now openly with the revival of the call for a &quot;one-state&quot; solution, we encounter the Palestinian refusal to accept a peace in which their state lives alongside Israel.</s> 

<s i="13">The methodology of terrorism; the continuing demonization of Israel on a daily basis by the Palestinian Authority and its media; the insistence even in 2005 of officially mourning Israel's original creation; and many other practices reflect this world view.</s> <s i="14">A more subtle aspect is putting the priority on violence and agitation rather than on building the infrastructure of a future state.</s> <s i="15">In pursuit of total victory--or at least keeping the door open for its pursuit--the Palestinian movement has squandered international goodwill and the huge financial aid it received in the 1990s.</s>

<s i="16">In making peace, then, the problem is not the precise delineation of borders or the status of every square centimeter of East Jerusalem, but this basic conceptual issue.</s> <s i="17">How can there be compromise if Palestinians are daily taught that Israel is doomed and that they will ultimately win?</s> <s i="18">Why else would it not be obvious to the Palestinians that their interest lay in making a post-occupation Gaza Strip into a showcase that would bolster a comprehensive solution as the next step?</s> 

<s i="19">This situation is in large part the legacy of Yasser Arafat, who never sought to transform the Palestinian struggle into a normal movement for a state.</s> <s i="20">Even in the 1990s Arafat refused to foreclose a permanent &quot;revolution until victory.&quot;</s> <s i="21">He made hardly a single speech designed to move his people toward a compromise peace.</s> 

<s i="22">Now, ironically, the rise of Hamas to the point of seizing control over the movement--or at least having veto power over any diplomatic positions--is based on the foundation that Fateh has built.</s> <s i="23">The nationalist leadership told the people for years that Israel would collapse, the Palestinians had a right to all its land, violence was the only tactic that works, and compromise was treason.</s> <s i="24">For decades, including the last one, Palestinians were told that the measure of legitimacy was with those who killed the most Israelis and took the most intransigent line.</s>

<s i="25">This is not to ignore the many other factors involved in creating this situation, from Israel's own positions in negotiations to the corruption of Fateh.</s> <s i="26">But the point is that this history has been funneled through a hegemonic Palestinian conception of the conflict that has not fundamentally changed.</s>
