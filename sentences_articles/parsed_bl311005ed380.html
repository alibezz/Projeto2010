<s i="0">The Wolfensohn mission is the product of a careful American policy calculation.</s> <s i="1">But if it doesn't receive stronger administration backing, it will fail, thereby denying us all one of the more attainable fruits of Gaza disengagement.</s>

<s i="2">The Bush administration endorsed PM Ariel Sharon's disengagement plan because that initiative appeared to be a feasible means of improving the situation without requiring any heavy American policy investment.</s> <s i="3">This reflects the current US order of priorities in dealing with the Middle East: first, getting out of Iraq without leaving behind a fiasco; second, deterring Iran from going nuclear; third, democratic reform in the region.</s> <s i="4">The Israeli-Palestinian conflict appears to be no higher than fourth on this list, insofar as an administration effort to actually solve the conflict would mandate a far larger investment in American energies and prestige, require a more viable Palestinian partner, and divert important diplomatic resources away from more pressing commitments elsewhere in the region.</s> <s i="5">Besides, such an effort could easily fail (like all its predecessors), with negative ramifications for the higher-priority aspects of US post-9/11 Middle East policy.</s> 

<s i="6">Accordingly, appointing senior and prestigious emissaries like James Wolfensohn and General William Ward appeared to be a solid and relatively cost-free way of ensuring the success of disengagement--which is, to be sure, a partial, one-sided measure, but a potentially win-win-win endeavor (for Israel, the Palestinians and the US) nevertheless.</s> <s i="7">Indeed, the US currently defines its primary objective with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as making disengagement work economically and politically in the aftermath of the Israeli withdrawal, rather than encouraging a second disengagement or roadmap-based peace talks.</s> <s i="8">That Wolfensohn came to the region under the aegis of the Quartet does not in any way diminish from the administration's responsibility for his mission.</s>

<s i="9">That mission is foundering.</s> <s i="10">The declining security situation, lack of effective Palestinian governance and leadership, and Israeli indifference have all been cited by Wolfensohn himself as reasons for the lack of progress.</s> <s i="11">Can the administration exercise its influence and assist?</s>

<s i="12">Frankly, there is not a lot that outside powers can do to help the Palestinians get a grip on their security situation.</s> <s i="13">General Ward has not been particularly effective in reorganizing the Palestinian security network.</s> <s i="14">Putting US pressure on Syria to expel the Islamic Jihad leadership from Damascus might help a little, by way of weakening the Palestinian terrorist organization that is currently doing the most security damage.</s> <s i="15">But this will be of limited efficacy as long as Iran backs Islamic Jihad.</s>  

<s i="16">Nor can the US do very much to improve Palestinian leadership.</s> <s i="17">Under current circumstances it can hardly even pressure Sharon to release prisoners in order to bolster the status of President Mahmoud Abbas, when we see recently released prisoners at the forefront of new terrorist acts against Israeli civilians, and when gunmen supposedly loyal to Abbas are leading the parade of Palestinian lawlessness.</s> <s i="18">Perhaps, when the huge Palestinian (and American) gamble of encouraging Hamas to take part in elections is behind us, we will see--as Abbas argues--an improvement in the security and governance situation.</s> <s i="19">And perhaps not.</s>

<s i="20">The security situation also overshadows considerations concerning the Erez and Karni crossings, i.e., land links between the Gaza Strip and Israel, as well as the attempts to activate an immediate Gaza-West Bank safe passage convoy arrangement and the problems surrounding the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Palestine.</s> <s i="21">In all these areas, Wolfensohn's efforts are severely constrained by security circumstances over which Washington has little influence.</s>

<s i="22">But there is one area where Washington can apply some pressure, in this case on the Sharon government, to get things moving and enable the Wolfensohn mission to begin to show some success: long-term transportation infrastructure projects.</s> <s i="23">Even if an immediate safe passage link is currently impossible due to security concerns, there is no viable reason to prevent the launching of a long-term project for a permanent link, in the form of a sunken or elevated road and/or railway.</s> <s i="24">If security concerns remain paramount five or ten years from now, when the project is completed, Israel can always refuse then to open the road.</s> <s i="25">Meanwhile, the planning and construction of such a link will reflect a graphic commitment by all concerned to the unity of the West Bank and Gaza, which is a minimum necessity for the eventual emergence of a viable Palestinian state--which, in turn, is ultimately the only way for Israel to remain a Jewish and democratic state.</s> 

<s i="26">Long-term safe passage should be Wolfensohn's flagship project.</s> <s i="27">The international financing is attainable.</s> <s i="28">It is hard to imagine any convincing argument on Sharon's part, if seriously pressured by the Bush administration, justifying further delay.</s>

<s i="29">The same goes for the Gaza seaport.</s> <s i="30">It represents a highly visible international commitment to Palestinian statehood and economic viability.</s> <s i="31">Financing is assured.</s> <s i="32">Again, Israel's very real security concerns can be dealt with before the port opens, three or four years from now.</s>
