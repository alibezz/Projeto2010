<s i="0">The Palestinian unity government talks chaperoned in recent months by the Egyptians appear to have failed.</s> <s i="1">Cairo is now talking about forming a joint committee or &quot;executive framework&quot; that will be virtually powerless vis-a-vis the two existing Palestinian governments in Ramallah and Gaza.</s> <s i="2">This appears to constitute primarily a way for all involved to save face without admitting total defeat.</s> <s i="3">The important unity issues--a jointly-formed government with an agreed platform, ground rules for new elections, merging Hamas into the PLO--remain unresolved.</s> <s i="4">In the absence of a unity government, little or none of the international aid pledged for rebuilding dwellings destroyed in the recent war is finding its way into the Strip.</s>

<s i="5">Accordingly, the de facto reality all parties face for the foreseeable future is that of the past two years: three states or political entities--Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.</s> <s i="6">Under these circumstances, while a two-state solution remains the only viable outcome to the entire conflict, talk of achieving it in the near future rings hollow.</s> <s i="7">On the other hand, those Israelis who believe the present situation of a divided Palestine works to Israel's advantage risk cultivating, through neglect, not one but two time bombs in our midst: a militant Islamist Gaza and a weak and unstable West Bank.</s>

<s i="8">Thus it behooves us to ask: Given that the current &quot;three state&quot; situation is not likely to change in the foreseeable future, how can we make the best of it?</s> <s i="9">Before we contemplate reuniting the West Bank and Gaza, we need two separate strategies for these separate and disparate entities.</s>

<s i="10">In the West Bank, we have to look for ways to ensure that moderates remain in power by implementing genuine confidence- and security-building measures that support them.</s> <s i="11">This means an absolute freeze on all settlement expansion, dismantling of outposts and even--if and when the security situation permits--coordinated unilateral Israeli withdrawal from additional parts of the West Bank.</s> <s i="12">While some form of final status talks may be helpful in creating an incentive for Palestinians--and US President Barack Obama's resolve in this regard is encouraging--the real work that Obama's emissary George Mitchell should prioritize is ensuring Israeli and Palestinian compliance with these conflict-management measures in the West Bank.</s> <s i="13">This should be easier to accomplish with the Netanyahu government than insisting immediately on a full-fledged Israeli-Palestinian peace process similar to those that have failed since 1993.</s>

<s i="14">Regarding the Gaza Strip, the situation is more clear-cut: all relevant parties must begin by recognizing that their strategies have failed.</s> <s i="15">Israel's military strategy failed back in January, as did the economic boycott strategy it pursued for nearly two years with the complicity of Egypt, the PLO and the Quartet.</s> <s i="16">Egypt's strategy of ensuring that Gaza is an Israeli problem just blew up in Cairo's face with the revelations about Hizballah's espionage and sabotage operations on Egyptian soil: Gaza is an Egyptian problem, too.</s> <s i="17">Perhaps this explains why Israel's reliance on Egypt to mediate ceasefire and prisoner-exchange deals with Hamas has also failed.</s> <s i="18">Meanwhile, Cairo's attempt to broker renewed Fateh-Hamas unification is failing because Hamas, with Iran's backing, refuses to compromise its extreme views concerning Israel-related issues while the PLO is too weak to bend Hamas to its will.</s>

<s i="19">Unless and until Hamas radically changes its attitude toward Israel, Jerusalem has every reason to quarantine it from the West Bank, lest a unity government or Palestinian elections strengthen its presence there.</s> <s i="20">But quarantining physically should not mean ignoring politically.</s> <s i="21">It's time for Israel to signal that it is prepared to talk to Hamas unconditionally.</s> <s i="22">On the initial agenda: prisoner-exchange and a long-term ceasefire.</s> <s i="23">If these can be accomplished, then and only then should they be followed by a joint exploration of ways in which peaceful coexistence with Gaza can be merged with peace with the West Bank.</s> <s i="24">Such an order of business, which is not necessarily incompatible with the Likud's approach to the conflict, appears more promising than the failed policies of the past two years.</s>
