<s i="0">Most Palestinians perceive the recent split between the West Bank and Gaza as a major setback to the strategic objective of establishing an independent Palestinian state in those areas as well as East Jerusalem.</s> 

<s i="1">Some Palestinians, however, particularly within the Hamas leadership, do not look at the split in quite the same way.</s> <s i="2">The objective of an independent Palestinian state is not necessarily Hamas' main strategic aim.</s> <s i="3">Islamists in Palestine are part of the regional political Islamic movement that aims not only at defeating foreign control but also achieving Islamic domination by defeating Arab secularists and nationalists.</s> 

<s i="4">Over the past three to five years, three factors have contributed to the shift in the balance of power that led first to Hamas' election victory and then to the military takeover in Gaza.</s> <s i="5">First is the unilateral Israel strategy that, together with Israeli measures to consolidate the occupation, to a very large degree has marginalized the secular camp in Palestine.</s> <s i="6">Second is the poor overall performance of the Palestinian Authority, particularly with regard to governance and internal security.</s> <s i="7">Third is the influence of Islamic radicalization in the region generally, which itself results from, among other factors, the failure of the nationalist Arab regimes and the shortsighted and often selfish regional policies of the major powers, especially the United States.</s> 

<s i="8">Israel can by no means be divorced from the internal Palestinian frictions that ultimately led to internecine fighting and the split between the West Bank and Gaza.</s> <s i="9">In fact, Israel actively encouraged this split more than a year before fighting erupted between Fateh and Hamas.</s> <s i="10">By putting Gaza under a strict siege after evacuating its settlements there, Israel in effect separated the West Bank from Gaza in all respects, and not just geographically.</s> <s i="11">Goods and people were unable to move between the two areas and even civil servants, including ministers, were barred from going from one part of occupied Palestinian territory to the other.</s> 

<s i="12">Most Palestinians believe that this is part of a well-studied Israeli strategy that is being systematically executed.</s> <s i="13">This strategy aims at dismantling the Palestinian territories in order to prevent a two-state solution from ever emerging.</s> <s i="14">By isolating Gaza, the overpopulated strip of land is de facto being linked to Egypt.</s> <s i="15">By separating the populated Palestinian areas of the West Bank from each other as well as Israel with a wall, leaving less populated areas open for further settlement expansion, Israel is also rendering the possibility of a coherent Palestinian polity emerging there ever less likely.</s> <s i="16">What remains of the West Bank once settlements and walls have eaten away at the territory will be encouraged to somehow merge with Jordan or in some other way accept to be administered by outside powers.</s> 

<s i="17">The recent fighting between Fateh and Hamas and the consequent political split between Gaza and the West Bank only aid and abet this Israeli strategy.</s> 

<s i="18">Publicly, Israel denies it is seeking such a split.</s> <s i="19">Israeli officials also deny that they are pursuing a unilateral strategy.</s> <s i="20">These public statements notwithstanding, it is clear from what is happening on the ground--the ever harsher isolation of Gaza; the complete separation of Gaza from the West Bank; the accelerating settlement project that includes an ever longer wall snaking its way in and around the West Bank; and the dramatically deteriorating conditions for Palestinians in the occupied territories and especially in Gaza--that the only thing that differentiates current Israeli government strategy vis-a-vis the Palestinians from Sharon's unilateral approach is that the Olmert government denies it is acting unilaterally while acting unilaterally.</s> 

<s i="21">Recent suggestions of a resumption of a political process are raising many questions among Palestinians.</s> <s i="22">What attracts the attention is that the Palestinian and the Israeli sides are not preparing their respective publics for any possible political breakthrough.</s> <s i="23">The results of the most recent Palestinian public opinion poll by the Jerusalem Media and Communications Center should therefore act as an early warning sign to the Palestinian leadership if it is involved in some kind of political discussion with Israel.</s> <s i="24">The gist of the poll in this regard is that while Palestinians are still committed to a two-state solution, they continue to insist that this solution be consistent with international legality.</s> <s i="25">In other words, the Palestinian public is not willing to compromise on the 1967 borders, the right of return of Palestinian refugees or the right of Palestinians to occupied East Jerusalem.</s> 

<s i="26">On the other side, neither the Israeli public nor the Israeli political echelon is prepared for any political progress.</s> <s i="27">This is partly because of political divisions among the coalition government partners and the resulting electoral atmosphere and partly, and more importantly, because it seems that one of the motives for Israeli willingness to engage Palestinians politically is an intention to exploit Palestinian divisions in order to extract significant concessions.</s>
