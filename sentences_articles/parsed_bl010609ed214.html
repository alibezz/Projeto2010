 <s i="0">Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas squandered a great opportunity and US President Barack Obama received a terrific lesson from their meeting.</s> <s i="1">Abbas showed that he, like his predecessors, would never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.</s> <s i="2">Here is a new American president, the potentially most pro-Palestinian chief executive in history, straining at the bit to move forward a peace process, quite open to the possibility of pressuring Israel.</s>

<s i="3">And Abbas gave him nothing.</s> 

<s i="4">&quot;I am confident that we can move this process forward,&quot; Obama said after meeting Abbas.</s> <s i="5">One would expect he's less confident now than before the meeting.</s>  

<s i="6">On one point, Abbas can expect US support: pressing Israel to stop any building whatsoever in Jewish settlements.</s> <s i="7">But how much effort will the United States put into this when Abbas--rather than being cooperative with the president's pet project--refuses to talk with Israel unless there is a total freeze.</s>

<s i="8">He could have tried to portray himself (falsely) as flexible and eager for peace.</s> <s i="9">After all, the president used such phrases as, &quot;We can't continue with the drift....We need to get this thing back on track....We don't have a moment to lose.&quot;</s>  <s i="10">But now, Abbas has played his hand: Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is ready to talk and the Palestinian Authority isn't. 

As for Abbas' pet project, unity with Hamas, Obama was not supportive of the PA's strategy.</s> <s i="11">It would be nice to have unity, said Obama--a mistake, but leave that aside for the present--but any coalition would have to accept all previous agreements and the Quartet's conditions.</s> <s i="12">And that Hamas will never do.</s>

<s i="13">Reportedly, Abbas' plan said nothing about what the PA would do to promote peace, only proposing an immediate freeze on any settlement activity and a timetable for Israeli withdrawal.</s> <s i="14">In other words, Israel gives him everything and he gives nothing.</s> <s i="15">One can only wonder whether, during the meeting, it occurred to Obama and his advisors that Abbas was acting precisely the way Netanyahu had predicted.</s> 

<s i="16">Obama did mention to Abbas such Israeli requirements--and Quartet demands--that the PA reduce anti-Israel incitement to violence.</s> <s i="17">But what could be a more indicative, almost humorously so, response than what Abbas told reporters: &quot;I believe that if the Israelis would withdraw from all occupied Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese land, the Arab world will be ready to have normal relationships with the state of Israel.&quot;</s>

<s i="18">Israel gives up all the territory and then maybe it gets something in return.</s> 

<s i="19">Abbas was quoted as saying: &quot;The Americans are the leaders of the world,&quot; adding, &quot;they can use their weight with anyone around the world.</s> <s i="20">Two years ago they used their weight on us.</s> <s i="21">Now they should tell the Israelis, 'You have to comply with the conditions.'&quot;</s> 

<s i="22">And that's the Palestinian strategy: America tells Israel to make all the concessions.</s> <s i="23">The PA accepts them.</s> <s i="24">In a real slap in the face to Obama, Abbas said he wouldn't even help presidential envoy George Mitchell by delivering any confidence-building measures.</s> <s i="25">Nobody could have put this better than Washington Post Deputy Editorial Page Editor Jackson Diehl: &quot;[Abbas] has revived a...Palestinian fantasy: that the United States will simply force Israel to make critical concessions, whether or not its democratic government agrees, while the Arabs passively watch and applaud.&quot;</s> <s i="26">I would only suggest that no revival is involved since this fantasy never dissipated in the first place.</s> 

<s i="27">A PA official has been quoted as saying that after a couple of years, US pressure will force Netanyahu to resign and presumably comply with whatever the United States, or rather whatever the PA, wants.</s>  <s i="28">Note that this &quot;patience&quot; not only clashes with Obama's impatience but also with supposed Palestinian suffering.</s> <s i="29">After all, the idea was that Palestinians are so miserable under &quot;occupation,&quot; so eager to escape bloodshed and so passionately yearning for a state they just cannot wait.</s>
