<s i="0">What Palestinians should understand about Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's unilateral plan are first that it is real, and second that the United States is in broad agreement with it.</s> <s i="1">This situation presents Palestinians with a critical question: what do they really want?</s>

<s i="2">The US will not agree to everything Israel might want to do.</s> <s i="3">The exact route
of the security fence is still under discussion.</s> <s i="4">The US will oppose an eastern fence, between the ridgeline and the Jordan Valley, and will oppose the annexation of any West Bank territory to Israel.</s> 

<s i="5">Don't be fooled, however, by the coming tussles over details.</s> <s i="6">The critical
components of Sharon's plan are: 1) settlement evacuation in almost all of Gaza and next to Palestinian cities in the West Bank, 2) increasing the population in the settlement blocs, such as Gush Etzion and Ma'ale Adumim, that Israel expects to keep, 3) continued military action against terrorism and missile threats in Palestinian areas, as necessary.</s>

<s i="7">The US will support Israel on all three counts, because the package is not seen to conflict with George W. Bush's two state vision and the roadmap to it.</s> <s i="8">So long as Palestinians choose the path of terror and violence, the US will press Israel to minimize the impact of its fight on Palestinian civilians, but will not oppose broad military actions against the terrorists themselves.</s> <s i="9">Further, it is an open question how long the US and Israel will continue to hold harmless a Palestinian Authority which barely hides its support for terror, and certainly does not lift a finger to stop it.</s>

<s i="10">If there is a wild card in both US and Israeli policy in the year ahead, it is to what extent Bush's original June 2002 message on the need for a new Palestinian leadership will be revived.</s> <s i="11">During the run-up to the war in Iraq, that message morphed into the roadmap and the US-European demand for a Palestinian prime minister.</s> <s i="12">Now Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is gone, but so is the idea that a Palestinian prime minister will painlessly wrest Yasser Arafat's veto power away from him and allow the crackdown against terror necessary for real negotiations to begin.</s>

<s i="13">Though Sharon's plan is rightly seen as consistent with the goal and broad structure of the roadmap, the means are a substitute for that plan.</s> <s i="14">Further, Sharon's unilateralism is at least a detour from the belief in the necessity of Palestinian regime change that a short time ago Bush and Sharon seemed to share.</s>

<s i="15">But this detour, while seemingly shifting the focus away from Bush's new leadership demand, could bring its wisdom into sharper focus.</s> <s i="16">Yasser Arafat's serial torpedoing of the 2000 Camp David summit, the roadmap, and two successive prime ministers has demonstrated that he will never abandon terror or the demand of &quot;return,&quot; and therefore will never sign a final two state peace with Israel.</s> <s i="17">Sharon's separation will further highlight the Palestinians' choice between continuing to fight Israel far past the point of diminishing returns, or getting on with creating their own state.</s>

<s i="18">For a generation, Israel was torn between two incompatible paradigms: staking a claim over all the territories, and trading them for peace.</s> <s i="19">Sharon's plan is designed to cut this Gordian knot in favor of land for peace.</s> <s i="20">This forces Palestinians to face their own Gordian knot: choosing between contradictory attempts to destroy Israel and make peace with it.</s>

<s i="21">The idea that United Nations votes can accomplish what tanks could not is a tempting one for Palestinians.</s> <s i="22">Time, and demography, are on their side, goes this thinking.</s> <s i="23">And the tremendous sacrifices in the current war would not be for naught, but the harbingers of a total victory.</s>

<s i="24">But in its unrealism this Palestinian messianism resembles nothing if not that of &quot;greater Israel&quot; proponents who believed the circle could somehow be squared between demography and democracy.</s> <s i="25">The Palestinians cannot, after they convinced the entire world they wanted a state next to Israel, say &quot;we changed our minds, we want to become citizens of Israel,&quot; against the will of even left-wing Israelis like Amos Oz.</s> 

<s i="26">So the Palestinians have a choice.</s> <s i="27">Bet on the world joining, and Israel succumbing to, a campaign telling Israelis, &quot;yes, you must commit suicide and become the 22nd Arab state.&quot;</s> <s i="28">Or alternatively, drop terror and the demand of &quot;return&quot; to Israel in exchange for a partition and a state of their own.</s>

<s i="29">It took over 30 years for Israel to settle the debate between trying to keep the land and giving it up (though Sadat-like Palestinian gestures would have convinced Israelis much sooner).</s> <s i="30">It is taking Palestinians even longer to decide between trying to destroy Israel and living next to it.</s> <s i="31">The Sharon plan and US support for it, which will not be fundamentally reversed even if the Democrats take the White House in November, mean that the territorial price the Palestinians pay for delaying their decision will only go up over time.</s>
