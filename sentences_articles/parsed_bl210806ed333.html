<s i="0">The outcome so far of the Israeli war on Lebanon is a mixed bag for Palestinians.</s> <s i="1">The war reinforced the near blind support Israel enjoys in what both Israel and the US consider the war on terror.</s> <s i="2">The Israelis clearly have a blank check to do almost anything they want to Lebanese or Palestinians so long as it is done in the name of a war against Hizballah or Hamas.</s>

<s i="3">At the same time, it seems clear that as a result of Lebanon, the international community is once again engaged in the Middle East.</s> <s i="4">With this engagement, the international community appears to have realized that simply leaving the parties to the Middle East conflict to solve their own problems will not produce any results.</s> <s i="5">The resulting stalemate, which has been tolerated until recently by the US and other world powers, produces no stability.</s> <s i="6">Just as the relatively minor cross-border attacks in Gaza and Lebanon produced avalanches of violence, a powder keg stalemate will result only in continued conflict.</s>
 
<s i="7">The recognition that the Palestinian problem continues to be a major irritant in the region and the wider Islamic world was also noted by a number of world leaders.</s> <s i="8">Tony Blair, Condoleezza Rice, Jacques Chirac and others were among many who spoke publicly about the need to deal with the root causes of Middle East conflict.</s>
 
<s i="9">Caught between unreserved US support for Israel (especially in its fight against Hamas) and the realization that the international community wants to re-engage to solve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the big question for Palestinians is how to proceed from here.</s> <s i="10">The road map endorsed by the Quartet was out of date the minute Israel unilaterally pulled out of Gaza.</s> <s i="11">With the Lebanon war considerably weakening Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, a similar attempt to unilaterally pull out of areas of the West Bank seems to have been put on hold.</s> 

<s i="12">But the Americans and their allies, who were never very excited about the idea of a unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank, would be mistaken if they expect Olmert to replace his &quot;convergence plan&quot; with serious negotiations with the Palestinians.</s> <s i="13">Indeed, in the coming months as the Israeli leadership concentrates its efforts on dealing with the fallout from Lebanon, little can be expected of them vis-a-vis the Palestinians.</s> <s i="14">Certainly nothing will happen so long as Hamas is still in power and an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, remains in Palestinian hands.</s>

<s i="15">Palestinian leaders Mahmoud Abbas and Ismail Haniyeh seem to have realized the need to remove any Israeli excuses not to engage with them.</s> <s i="16">A hitherto underreported agreement over the so-called Prisoners' Document is expected to usher in the establishment of a national unity government that will include Islamist and secular nationalist factions.</s> 

<s i="17">It remains to be seen whether such a government and its inevitably more moderate political program will be sufficient to ease the financial siege that was imposed on Palestinians and that has crippled the Palestinian National Authority.</s> <s i="18">A more significant change is likely to occur if a solution is found that can lead to the release of Shalit and an end to the firing of the amateur rockets from Gaza to Israel.</s> <s i="19">But no matter what happens in Lebanon, for Palestine to benefit it will require a stable and moderate Palestinian government whose agenda is clearly in favor of the two-state solution.</s>

<s i="20">If the Lebanon war has shown the fragility of the region and the utter failure of unilateralism to solve anything, it has also shown the overwhelming power of the United States.</s> <s i="21">While pragmatism is needed to shake up the Palestinian track, ultimately any serious breakthrough in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict will require the strong and continuous engagement of the world's only remaining superpower.</s>
