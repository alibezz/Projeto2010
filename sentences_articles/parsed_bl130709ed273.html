<s i="0">Israeli settlements in the territories captured in the 1967 Six-Day War date back more than 40 years.</s> <s i="1">They began as military and agricultural outposts located for the most part in strategically significant areas of the West Bank that Israel planned eventually to claim.</s> <s i="2">These settlements were also situated in areas from which Jews had been evicted during the 1948 war.</s> <s i="3">While the United States did not support the settlement enterprise, its response to the settlements has varied in intensity, depending on the overall relationship between the two countries.</s>

<s i="4">In the late 1960s, the Johnson administration was critical of Israeli settlement activity, but did not characterize the settlements as illegal.</s> <s i="5">Indeed, Eugene Rostow, a former dean of Yale Law School who was undersecretary of state in the Johnson years, would write years later that, &quot;Israel has an unassailable legal right to establish settlements in the West Bank.&quot;</s> <s i="6">It was not until the Carter administration that State Department Legal Advisor Herbert Hansell expressed the view that the settlements violated international law.</s> <s i="7">The Carter policy was reversed by all of his successors.</s> <s i="8">Thus, President Ronald Reagan declared in 1981 that the settlements were &quot;not illegal&quot;.</s> <s i="9">He criticized them on policy grounds, calling them &quot;ill-advised&quot; and &quot;proactive&quot;.</s>

<s i="10">The question about the legality of settlements derives from the way various legal authorities interpret the applicability of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention relative to civilian persons in times of war.</s> <s i="11">Article 49 of the convention clearly prohibits &quot;mass forcible transfers&quot; of protected persons from occupied territories.</s> <s i="12">Later in the article, it states that, &quot;the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.&quot;</s> <s i="13">American interpretations of this article maintained that it referred to forcible deportations that were practiced by the Nazis and not to Israeli settlement activity.</s> 

<s i="14">Many observers are surprised to learn that settlement activity was not defined as a violation of the 1993 Oslo accords or their subsequent implementation agreements.</s> <s i="15">During the secret negotiations leading up to the signing of Oslo, Yasser Arafat instructed his negotiators to seek a &quot;settlement freeze&quot; but PM Yitzhak Rabin and FM Shimon Peres rejected Arafat's demand.</s> <s i="16">Nonetheless, Arafat agreed to the Oslo accords despite the lack of a settlement freeze.</s> <s i="17">The Oslo accords were essentially an interim arrangement; they stipulated that the issue of settlements would be addressed in permanent status negotiations.</s> <s i="18">If the US is subsequently seeking to constrain Israeli settlement activity, it is essentially trying to obtain additional Israeli concessions that were not formally required according to Israel's legal obligations under Oslo.</s>

<s i="19">Settlements became a far more salient issue with the release in 2001 of the report of a commission headed by Senator George Mitchell that sought to address the outbreak of the second intifada in 2000 and to propose a return to negotiations.</s> <s i="20">The Mitchell report recommended that as a part of confidence-building measures between the parties, &quot;Israel should freeze all settlement activity, including the 'natural growth' of existing settlements.&quot;</s> <s i="21">The Bush administration adopted the Mitchell report, putting the settlement issue right in the center of US-Israel discussions.</s>

<s i="22">It appeared at the time that the US felt itself to be in an awkward position as an honest broker in peacemaking if Israel were to expropriate more land for settlement growth during the course of future negotiations.</s> <s i="23">To address this concern, the Sharon government proposed a formula whereby Israel could continue to build within existing settlements, but only from the outer ring of construction inward in each settlement.</s> <s i="24">That way, Israel could address the need for natural growth without taking more land for Israelis living in the settlements.</s>

<s i="25">As the Bush administration drafted its 2003 roadmap for peace, it decided to include the Mitchell report's settlement freeze.</s> <s i="26">Dov Weisglass, who headed PM Ariel Sharon's negotiating team on the settlement issue, has explained that Sharon had serious reservations about the proposed freeze.</s> <s i="27">Weisglass relates that in order to facilitate the Israeli government's acceptance of the roadmap, Israel reached an understanding with the US about what exactly a settlement freeze entailed.</s> <s i="28">The two sides concluded that no new settlements would be built; no Palestinian land would be expropriated or otherwise seized for the purpose of settlement construction; building within the settlements would be confined to &quot;the existing line of construction&quot;; and public funds would not be earmarked for encouraging settlements.</s> <s i="29">Weisglass also wrote to US National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice in 2004 that his government undertook to remove what were known as &quot;unauthorized outposts&quot;.</s> 

<s i="30">The Bush administration and the Sharon government never formalized these understandings in writing.</s> <s i="31">This has allowed the Obama administration to question their existence and validity.</s> <s i="32">President Bush's deputy national security advisor, Elliot Abrams, has been partially supportive of Weisglass' claim, arguing in April of this year that the US and Israel had negotiated specific guidelines for settlement activity even if they were never &quot;formally adopted&quot;.</s> <s i="33">According to Abrams, the formula succeeded in creating a situation whereby &quot;settlement activity is not diminishing the territory of a future Palestinian entity.&quot;</s>
 
<s i="34">The Obama administration's current focus on Israeli settlement activity--including natural growth--raises a number of questions.</s> <s i="35">If the US is concerned that Israel might diminish the territory that the Palestinians will receive in the future, then the Obama team could continue with the quiet guidelines followed by the Bush administration and the Sharon government.</s> <s i="36">Given the fact that the amount of territory taken up by the built-up areas of all the settlements in the West Bank is estimated to be 1.7 percent of the territory, the marginal increase in territory that might be affected by natural growth is infinitesimal.</s> <s i="37">Moreover, since Israel unilaterally withdrew 9,000 Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005, the argument that a settler presence will undermine a future territorial compromise has lost much of its previous force.</s>
