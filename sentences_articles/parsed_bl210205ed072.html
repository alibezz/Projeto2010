<s i="0">Saeed Talib is an American citizen and a West Bank farmer.</s> <s i="1">Neither is standing him in good stead at the moment.</s> <s i="2">He has not been able to tend to his land in the village of Turmus Ayya on the road north to Nablus for four years, and he is afforded no legal recourse from any quarter.</s>

<s i="3">Some six years ago, a settlement outpost was established near the village.</s> <s i="4">The settler who first drove up his caravan on an empty hilltop has since become notorious.</s> <s i="5">All the villagers know him as Boaz.</s> <s i="6">He is no longer alone.</s> <s i="7">Now, some 50 caravans stand beside his.</s> <s i="8">According to Israeli law, these settlement outposts are illegal.</s> <s i="9">But the Israeli government has nevertheless provided them with paved roads, electricity and running water.</s> 

<s i="10">Saeed and his fellow villagers have been allowed onto their land for only a few days a year since the intifada began.</s> <s i="11">These are during the October-November olive harvest season.</s> <s i="12">The farmers are desperate.</s> <s i="13">Two days a year, only to harvest, is neither here nor there.</s> <s i="14">For the rest of the year they are prevented from tending their land, from planting seedlings or from weeding and trimming.</s> 

<s i="15">Before the intifada, farmers used to defy the settlers.</s> <s i="16">There were many confrontations and arguments.</s> <s i="17">Just before the intifada broke out, Boaz awoke to find his herd of sheep gone and his dogs dead.</s> <s i="18">He strolled into another nearby village al-Mughayyer, and hung up leaflets in Hebrew.</s> <s i="19">The leaflets warned the villagers that if he was not compensated $1,500 per dog and his sheep were not returned within 24 hours, he, Boaz, would cut down 700 trees.</s> <s i="20">No money and no sheep were forthcoming.</s> <s i="21">The next day, Boaz returned with an armed gang and in the presence of the Israeli army cut down 700 trees.</s> <s i="22">Months later, villagers reported that his sheep had been found in the Jordan Valley, and his purpose had been to claim compensation.</s>

<s i="23">The violence doesn't stop.</s> <s i="24">On the outskirts of another nearby village, Sinjel, settlers from Ma'ale Levona erected caravans the Israeli government now describes as &quot;semi-illegal&quot;, or &quot;scheduled to become legal&quot;.</s> <s i="25">These settlers' wont is to burn down wheat fields every summer.</s> <s i="26">Last summer 50 dunams were thus laid to waste before the villagers could put out the fire.</s> <s i="27">To protect these settlers, the Israeli army built a camp next to the outpost.</s> <s i="28">Every one knows that one day, that camp will be filled with more settlers.</s>

<s i="29">During the intifada, confronting the settlers has become far too dangerous for the farmers.</s> <s i="30">There is little direct contact.</s> <s i="31">Villagers have been warned to stay at a distance of 1,000 to 1,500 meters from the &quot;borders&quot; of any settlement or outpost.</s> <s i="32">Any closer and they are shot at, sometimes wounded and sometimes killed.</s> <s i="33">The settlers are above the law.</s> <s i="34">People are shot, their fields are burned and their machinery or houses damaged.</s> <s i="35">The settler is the king of the West Bank.</s>

<s i="36">When Saeed went to harvest olives on the two days he was allowed onto his land he was shot at.</s> <s i="37">His car was burned.</s> <s i="38">Settlers came to chase him away.</s> <s i="39">He told them he would call the police.</s> <s i="40">One shouted back at him: &quot;I'll give you my number.</s> <s i="41">I am the police.</s> <s i="42">I am the army.&quot;</s> <s i="43">The settler is king.</s>

<s i="44">According to international law, all settlements are illegal.</s> <s i="45">According to Israeli law, the outposts, established without prior planning with the Israeli army, are illegal.</s> <s i="46">This illegality, however, has become a means for the army to avoid confronting outpost settlers.</s> <s i="47">They simply don't apply the law.</s> 

<s i="48">Outposts have a habit of multiplying and expanding.</s> <s i="49">They have a habit of becoming permanent.</s> <s i="50">They are the biggest provocation faced by ordinary people on the ground.</s> <s i="51">On the same day as the signing of the Oslo Accords, a concerted Israeli drive to multiply settlements and outposts in the West Bank in particular was set in motion.</s> <s i="52">The number of settlers doubled between 1993 and 2000.</s> <s i="53">The signal to the average Palestinian was unmistakable.</s> <s i="54">While Israeli officials smiled on TV they took more land on the ground.</s> 

<s i="55">At a time of some confidence between the two sides, it took a while before this obvious transgression of the spirit if not the letter of the Oslo Accords was translated into direct anger.</s> <s i="56">Now, after the latest intifada, very much sparked by anger at the continued settlement expansions and the flourishing of settlement outposts, there is no confidence.</s> <s i="57">If Israel wants to persuade any Palestinian that it is serious about peace, that it is serious about two states, then these outposts must be removed.</s> <s i="58">People no longer believe fine words.</s> <s i="59">People want results on the ground.</s>
