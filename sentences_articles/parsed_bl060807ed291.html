<s i="0">In both Israel and Palestine, the prospect of national elections in 2008 has become an integral feature of an optimistic scenario of progress toward new Israeli-Palestinian political accommodation.</s> <s i="1">Both PM Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas appear to believe that electoral victories will vindicate and validate their current peace strategies.</s> <s i="2">The United States has become an active accomplice in this endeavor.</s>

<s i="3">All are more than likely to be sorely disappointed.</s>

<s i="4">According to the &quot;best case&quot; narrative we can attach to these strategies, Olmert and Abbas register significant progress in their bi-weekly talks in the coming three months.</s> <s i="5">At the tactical level, confidence-building measures are implemented successfully: security improves, the Palestinian economy in the West Bank recovers, Israel removes a few &quot;illegal&quot; outposts, and so on--the list of things to do is long.</s> 

<s i="6">At the strategic level, the two sides manage to agree on a new set of principles for final status that encompasses most, if not all, of the relevant issues.</s> <s i="7">US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice then hosts a dramatic international &quot;meeting&quot; in Washington in November where an impressive array of Arab leaders, including senior Saudis, give their blessing to a new Israeli-Palestinian peace process.</s>

<s i="8">At this point, Olmert and Abbas take their achievement to the people.</s> <s i="9">Each asks for and receives a new popular mandate to pursue an accelerated peace process.</s> <s i="10">Olmert caps a dramatic political recovery with an electoral victory, sweeping the moderate Israeli camp.</s> <s i="11">Abbas and Fateh erase Hamas' parliamentary majority and outpoll it even in Gaza; alternatively, Hamas in Gaza boycotts the election and marginalizes itself.</s> <s i="12">Peace takes off.</s>

<s i="13">The biggest flaws in this scenario can be found in its roots: the dreadful political dilemma shared by Olmert, Abbas and US President George W. Bush.</s> <s i="14">Olmert is unpopular in Israel because of his failure to manage last summer's war successfully and his subsequent flaunting of the condemnation of his mistakes by the Winograd commission of inquiry and, more recently, by the national controller.</s> <s i="15">Ahead lie the Winograd commission final report and sharp warnings of possible additional violence on both Israel's northern and Gaza fronts.</s> <s i="16">Olmert, desperately in need of an &quot;agenda&quot; that can render him valuable to his own Kadima party and the public, appears to have fixed on Abbas and the West Bank.</s>

<s i="17">Abbas, too, has seen popular support slip after losing Gaza and failing to deliver on either security or economic progress.</s> <s i="18">And he is surrounded by skepticism and hostility.</s> <s i="19">The Americans and moderate Arabs are disappointed with his meek leadership.</s> <s i="20">The Americans prefer his prime minister, Salam Fayyad, who is not from Fateh, while the Egyptians and Saudis counsel reconciliation with Hamas and Jordan fears being dragged back into the West Bank.</s>

<s i="21">Then, too, there is another political dilemma involved here: Rice and the beleaguered Bush desperately need a demonstration of progress on the Israeli-Palestinian front in order to relieve Arab pressure on the Iraqi and Iranian fronts.</s> <s i="22">That they didn't get involved to this extent five or three years ago reflects Bush's real inclination to confine his involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to rhetoric.</s>

<s i="23">Hence the stabilization plus peace plus elections scenario could easily collapse along a number of fault lines.</s> <s i="24">Iran, Syria, Hizballah and Hamas all have an interest in stymieing progress toward stabilization by invoking violence.</s> <s i="25">As for agreeing on a set of peace principles to bring to an international gathering, we've been there before: wiser Israeli leaders than Olmert, more powerful Palestinians than Abbas and more involved Americans than Bush and Rice have all failed.</s> <s i="26">In the interim, the issues at hand haven't changed, while Israelis and Palestinians appear to have moved farther apart.</s> <s i="27">Regarding elections, say, eight to ten months from now, the Israeli public will not easily forgive Olmert's mistakes, while the Palestinian public could easily hold to the mantra that &quot;Hamas was never really given a chance to govern&quot;.</s> <s i="28">Finally, developments on the Iraq or Iran front could radically change American priorities.</s>

<s i="29">Some might argue that the best way to deal with these counter-forces is to provide precisely the kind of upbeat framework and timetable for progress that we now confront.</s> <s i="30">After all, if necessary the international meeting can always be postponed to accommodate setbacks (it already appears to have been moved from September to November).</s> <s i="31">Yet this approach still assumes that demonstrably weak leaders--Olmert, Abbas, Bush--can somehow rise to the occasion and surprise us all and that the two-state solution can still be rescued despite the Palestinian political and geographic split and Israel's crawling settlement expansion.</s> 

<s i="32">Here we should remind ourselves that another spectacular failure to register progress toward Israeli-Palestinian peace will make it that much harder for future, stronger leaders to move ahead.</s> <s i="33">A more modest set of goals, confined to the confidence-building stage and involving our Arab state neighbors in regional solutions, would appear to make more sense.</s>
