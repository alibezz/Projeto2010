<s i="0">For all its drawbacks and limitations, the current informal ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is an impressive achievement.</s> <s i="1">It is part of a larger strategic picture that is characterized by Palestinian reforms--in the security, economic and governmental fields--and Israel's movement toward disengagement.</s> <s i="2">Both Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and President Mahmoud Abbas have demonstrated admirable political and personal courage.</s>

<s i="3">At an even broader regional and global level, events in Palestine in turn parallel at least in part the democracy and reform movements in places as disparate as Iraq, Lebanon and Ukraine.</s>

<s i="4">In this regard, the challenge of sustaining the ceasefire has broad strategic implications.</s> <s i="5">But it is also a practical task, one characterized by issues of tactical decision-making, logistics, and down-to-earth politics.</s>

<s i="6">At the strategic level it is important to recognize that, in view of the internal political situation in both Israel and Palestine and the views of both Sharon and Abbas, this ceasefire can, at best, facilitate a series of unilateral Israeli disengagements and Palestinian reforms that stabilize the situation.</s> <s i="7">There is almost certainly no final status peace process on the agenda in the near term of, say, the next 12/18 months, and we must avoid attaching overblown expectations to the political ramifications of a ceasefire.</s> <s i="8">But disengagement and reform are positive moves in their own right and hopefully will eventually pave the way for a peace process.</s>

<s i="9">At the tactical level there is a lot that both sides can do to strengthen and sustain the ceasefire.</s> <s i="10">Israel can quickly complete the fence as close as possible to the green line, thereby radically reducing the physical capacity of Palestinian terrorists to carry out murderous acts against Israelis.</s> <s i="11">And it can release prisoners, including--as IDF Chief of Staff Yaalon has proposed--aging and veteran prisoners with &quot;blood on their hands&quot;, in order to strengthen the hand of Abbas and his anti-violence agenda.</s>

<s i="12">On the Palestinian side, Abbas has to find a way not only to integrate Hamas and other extremist elements into Palestinian politics, but eventually to disarm them as well.</s> <s i="13">Otherwise we are liable to confront a Palestinian Islamist camp that, like Hizballah in Lebanon, is both a prominent player in politics and an independent and aggressive militia capable of holding Israeli and Palestinian leaders hostage to a ceasefire.</s> <s i="14">Further, Abbas has to engineer the same security establishment reforms in the West Bank, including replacing ineffective veteran commanders, as he did in Gaza.</s> <s i="15">The reception awarded new Interior Minister Nasser Yusef in Jenin on March 1--a hail of bullets from local Fatah dissidents--is symptomatic of the challenges ahead.</s> 

<s i="16">Perhaps the key test of both Abbas' will and his capability to change the situation is the issue of the trial and jailing of Palestinian terrorists.</s> <s i="17">If the &quot;revolving door&quot; policy returns, there is little hope for this or any ceasefire; if, on the other hand, Palestinian terrorist murderers are put into real jails for long sentences, we will know Abbas is succeeding.</s>

<s i="18">Last week the London Conference pledged a whopping $1.2 billion, including an unprecedented $391 million from the United States, toward Palestinian reform, including within the security establishment.</s> <s i="19">This demonstrated the readiness of the international community to help stabilize the situation.</s>
