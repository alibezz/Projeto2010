<s i="0">Israel's two-front war with the forces of Islamist extremism is taking place against a Middle East and international backdrop that is near-revolutionary.</s> <s i="1">The region is split along radical-moderate and Shi'ite-Sunni lines.</s> <s i="2">Iran, exploiting American mistakes, is spearheading a Shi'ite revival.</s> <s i="3">Iran and Syria together are leading the radical camp.</s> <s i="4">The traditional Sunni Arab powers, Egypt and particularly Saudi Arabia, are encouraging Israel to proceed and cut Hizballah down to size, thereby delivering a setback to Iran and Syria; Egypt is again trying to mediate a ceasefire and prisoner release agreement with Hamas in Gaza, on conditions advantageous to Israel.</s> 

<s i="5">The international community, led by the United States, is delaying intervention in the hope that Israel's strategy in Lebanon will pay off, despite the massive destruction of infrastructure and humanitarian suffering in that country.</s> <s i="6">(Not surprisingly, both Iran and Saudi Arabia are poised to pay for Lebanon's recovery.) When the war ends, a non-UN international force of some sort is almost certain to replace the IDF in southern Lebanon.</s>

<s i="7">After nearly two weeks of war in Lebanon, and even longer on the Gaza front, we can begin to identify those broad areas where Israel should, and should not, develop new strategies.</s>

<s i="8">Beginning with what not to do: Israel cannot and should not try to impose a &quot;new order&quot; on Lebanon or for that matter on the region.</s> <s i="9">Israel's contribution is to strike a first, serious blow at the forces of radical Islam surrounding it on two fronts.</s> <s i="10">But any Israeli attempt to lead in a regional political sense will be counterproductive.</s> <s i="11">The less said by Israel about changing the region, the better.</s>

<s i="12">On the other hand, the current conflagration does provide a unique opportunity for Israel to quietly draw closer to the moderate Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia, on key strategic issues.</s> <s i="13">It is no coincidence that PM Ehud Olmert wants Arab states to participate in a multinational force in Lebanon.</s> <s i="14">In this regard it is now imperative that Israel and the moderate Sunni states also quietly confront the United States with the consequences of its precipitous democratic reform policies in the region: the enfranchisement of radical Islamists, mainly Shi'ite, and the strengthening of Iran.</s> <s i="15">Israel is currently paying the price for this mistake (though it contributed with mistakes of its own as well); hopefully, it is undoing some of the damage.</s> <s i="16">But Washington, too, has to be brought into a more active role in this regard.</s>

<s i="17">Looking at the new Iranian and Shi'ite-led radical bloc as a whole, Syria is the weak link.</s> <s i="18">It is a Sunni majority country with a problematic Alawite regime that finds its interests threatened on all fronts, and that in recent years has repeatedly asked to reopen a peace process with Israel.</s> <s i="19">Now may be the time to take up Bashar Assad's offer.</s> <s i="20">Talks with Syria could be key not only to neutralizing Hizballah but to weakening Hamas.</s> <s i="21">Here, too, Washington will have to be persuaded that its pressure on Israel to shun such an option is no longer useful.</s>

<s i="22">Turning to Gaza, where the regional Arab Sunni weakness is also Palestinian weakness, we should be looking, with Egyptian help, for a separate ceasefire.</s> <s i="23">That effort is being hampered by Palestinian factionalism.</s> <s i="24">One way or another, we have to compartmentalize the strategically more significant Lebanese front and deflate Hassan Nasrallah's aspiration to represent the Palestinians.</s> <s i="25">Ceasefires would also enable Israel to get back to the business of withdrawal from heavily populated Palestinian areas, including parts of East Jerusalem.</s>
