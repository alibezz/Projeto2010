<s i="0">Israeli-Palestinian relations have visibly entered a new phase, as the two exhausted sides appear to be rethinking their conflict policies after over 38 months of stalemated fighting.</s> <s i="1">The indicators of the change are obvious.</s> <s i="2">On the Palestinian side, the rise of Abu Ala (Ahmed Qurei) as prime minister has led to a new ceasefire initiative, which could serve as a platform for upcoming negotiations with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</s> <s i="3">At the same time, there is a growing recognition in Israel that a decisive military victory over the Palestinians is beyond reach, and that therefore some compromise could serve the country�s interests better than a prolonged war of attrition.</s>

<s i="4">The mutual fatigue, which has already brought both Israelis and Palestinians to lower the conflict�s intensity, gives the current effort to stop the violence a better chance to succeed than previous, failed attempts.</s> <s i="5">Other factors support this optimistic assessment.</s> <s i="6">Sharon has lost his magic grip over Israeli public opinion, and lags behind in his approval ratings.</s> <s i="7">The Israeli consensus over the war has been torn apart, as the previously mute left wing regained the political initiative with a series of endeavors, from the refusenik pilots to the Geneva accords and the public warning by four retired security chiefs.</s> <s i="8">Under domestic attack, Sharon pledged a new diplomatic initiative, and hinted at a possible removal of settlements in Gaza as part of a unilateral package.</s> 

<s i="9">Sharon faces strong criticism from the right and within his Likud Party, but powerful players have adhered to his new, moderate tone.</s> <s i="10">The Israel Defense Forces, which have long advocated a forceful showdown in order to �burn the Palestinian consciousness� against using terrorism, have changed course.</s> <s i="11">Instead of using more force, the military now advocates a quick withdrawal from Palestinian West Bank cities and entry into negotiations, fearing that �time is on the Palestinians� side�.</s> <s i="12">Ehud Olmert, Sharon�s loyal deputy, calls for a deep unilateral withdrawal from the occupied territories, in order to save Israel�s Jewish majority and character.</s> <s i="13">Olmert�s call is heresy by Likud standards; nevertheless Sharon tacitly backed him, signaling that Olmert is his political pathfinder.</s>

<s i="14">Abu Ala has tried his best to avoid the hurdles which ruined his predecessor Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) and led to the latter's swift resignation.</s> <s i="15">The new premier avoided meeting Sharon before forging a Palestinian consensus.</s> <s i="16">He even refrained from asking for American support, while Washington was careful not to �hug� him.</s> <s i="17">And most importantly, instead of appearing to oust Yasir Arafat, Abu Ala has willingly bowed to the veteran leader�s authority and declared himself his loyal subordinate.</s> <s i="18">By giving away any claim to wield security authority, Abu Ala aimed to keep Arafat on his side.</s> <s i="19">Sharon has grudgingly accepted the new-old order, and even praised Abu Ala�s political experience and shrewdness as good signs.</s>

<s i="20">Alas, the same factors also work against the new calming efforts and diminish their chances for success.</s> <s i="21">Sharon�s weakness guarantees that he will find it difficult to recruit political support for compromise.</s> <s i="22">True to form, following an initial moderate opening Sharon resorted to his usual threatening mode, and warned the Palestinians that if they fail to make a deal with him, they might be locked behind fences and remain in control of less than half of the West Bank.</s>

<s i="23">Israel treats Abu Ala in a cold, businesslike manner, without the summit atmosphere that enveloped its dealings with Abu Mazen.</s> <s i="24">But this obvious lack of enthusiasm makes it harder to convince the wary Israeli public that there is a new opportunity.</s> <s i="25">Moreover, Israel disapproves of Abu Ala�s declared policy of prolonged ceasefire rather than the uprooting of terrorism, and rejects outright his demand to stop security fence construction in the West Bank.</s> <s i="26">And the Arafat patronage may have helped legitimize Abu Ala domestically, but the old leader�s return to center stage is an assured recipe for trouble with Israel, especially since all Palestinian security forces report to Arafat.</s>

<s i="27">The American distance from the scene will only grow as the November 2004 presidential elections draw closer.</s> <s i="28">Washington is still engaged in micromanaging the conflict, mainly to prevent Israel from prejudging the final status through fence and settlement construction.</s> <s i="29">This is insufficient, however, to draw both sides toward a genuine compromise.</s> 

<s i="30">But the main obstacle for a real breakthrough has not changed since the outbreak of violence in late summer 2000: Israel�s proposals are far below the minimum acceptable to the Palestinians.</s> <s i="31">Even the �virtual� Geneva accord, which bespeaks a better deal for the Palestinians than the rejected Barak proposals of Camp David and Taba, failed to gain strong Palestinian endorsement.</s> <s i="32">Clearly, the Palestinians will never accept any less generous proposition by Sharon, even if he continues down the path of withdrawal and settlement evacuation.</s> 

<s i="33">Thus there is a good chance for a period of relative quiet.</s> <s i="34">But the underlying causes of the conflict are bound to undermine it eventually and prevent any deeper change.</s>
