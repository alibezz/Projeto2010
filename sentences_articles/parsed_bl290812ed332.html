<s i="0">Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is by all accounts expected to receive a standing ovation at the UN General Assembly this week for carrying out his unilateral disengagement plan.</s> <s i="1">He will be lauded, as he already has been in some quarters, as a &quot;man of peace&quot; who has made a significant contribution to furthering the prospects of a settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</s> <s i="2">The irony of this, needless to say, is so heavy you could use it to demolish houses.</s> 

<s i="3">The tragedy is that the withdrawal of just 8,000 settlers from a few settlements in five percent of occupied Palestinian territory, that is, about one percent of historical Palestine, should elicit such hysterical hyperbole.</s> <s i="4">It is a measure of how successful Israel has been in deflecting attention from two of the most important issues that need to be tackled for this conflict to be settled.</s> 

<s i="5">In and of itself, the withdrawal from Gaza Strip settlements and military positions is welcome, whatever may come next.</s> <s i="6">It will tangibly ease conditions for Gazans and make life less dangerous and more bearable.</s> <s i="7">But it must not be allowed to deflect attention from the ever-tightening stranglehold Israel is exerting on the West Bank.</s> <s i="8">One only needs to take a brief glimpse at the new &quot;terminal&quot; at Qalandiya to understand what Israel has in mind here.</s> 

<s i="9">If one believes that by acting unilaterally, even if it means giving up on the greater Israel idea, Israel is in any way furthering the prospects of peace, one is delusional.</s> <s i="10">But forget unilateral: the very fact that any negotiations should be held over the status of any part of the West Bank including East Jerusalem is a testament to the weakness of the Palestinian position and the cowardliness of the international community.</s> <s i="11">That the major settlement blocs are already, with a nudge and a wink, implicitly understood to belong to Israel is a travesty.</s> 

<s i="12">But there is more.</s> <s i="13">Yes, the illegal Jewish settlements in Palestinian territory occupied in 1967 are a major obstacle to peace.</s> <s i="14">They prevent the emergence of a viable and contiguous state on the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="15">Yes, Israel has made it so difficult to remove these settlements that even evacuating the above mentioned minor Gaza Strip settlements left Palestinian factions scrapping to claim &quot;victory&quot; and the international community lauding a &quot;major step toward peace&quot;.</s> 

<s i="16">But a vast majority of Palestinians are refugees.</s> <s i="17">Their homes, their lands and their livelihoods were in what is now considered Israel.</s> <s i="18">The fate of these refugees, while ostensibly and outrageously also something to be negotiated, seems to have been already decided and not with a nudge and a wink.</s> <s i="19">Never mind international law, human rights or simple common decency.</s> <s i="20">It is an even bigger travesty of justice, and it doesn't matter how many times and to how many people it has happened before.</s>
