<s i="0">If necessity is the mother of political invention, the meetings between PM Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas, choreographed by the Bush administration, should be very productive.</s> <s i="1">A dramatic breakthrough resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would certainly be a major boost for all three governments.</s> 

<s i="2">However, the substance of any such agreement and its long-term impact are far from clear.</s> <s i="3">Skeptics (or realists) note that a lasting peace requires a wide societal acceptance of compromise, and this will still take many years once the maps in Palestinian textbooks start to include Israel.</s> <s i="4">Until then, a facade that provides the illusion of the &quot;end of conflict&quot;, but without the political foundation, would be very costly.</s> <s i="5">The 1983 Lebanon-Israel peace treaty was built on very thin air and collapsed quickly.</s> 

<s i="6">In contrast, optimists believe that the very weakness of Abbas and the Fateh movement and Olmert's Kadima-led coalition provides the opportunity for a bold agreement.</s> <s i="7">Fateh and Abbas are in no position to make impossible demands of Israel and this is the best time for a pragmatic compromise.</s> <s i="8">On the Israeli side, Olmert remains vulnerable and needs a new program to replace the failed strategy of unilateral disengagement.</s> <s i="9">Negotiations with Abbas and Salam Fayyad and the prospect of an historic agreement to &quot;end the conflict&quot; give Olmert and Kadima a chance for recovery.</s>

<s i="10">Similarly, the US government--the perennial third party in Middle East peace efforts--needs a major diplomatic success.</s>  <s i="11">The colossal failure in conducting the Iraq war and the losses sustained in the 2006 congressional elections are behind this renewed activity.</s>

<s i="12">On this basis, the first real engagement since the collapse of the Oslo process began with confidence-building measures.</s> <s i="13">Israel released 250 Palestinians held on charges related to terror, members of Fateh's Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades promised to lay down their weapons and take up the path of peace in exchange for immunity and Israel announced some relaxation of security measures and checkpoints.</s> <s i="14">Predictably, critics denounced these steps: for Palestinians they provided far too little; for Israelis they risked an increase in terror attacks.</s> 

<s i="15">Nevertheless, the CBMs were sufficient to set the stage for the resumption of regular talks between Abbas and Olmert.</s> <s i="16">The goal, as repeated in Washington and Jerusalem, is to progress toward the creation of a Palestinian state and, on this basis, toward the long awaited two-state agreement to end the conflict, to be endorsed by an international conference (or workshop) that may (or may not) include high-level Saudi participation.</s>

<s i="17">The next phase of such a pragmatic approach would be to draw borders, but since the Gaza Strip cannot be included in a Palestinian state under the control of Hamas the focus is on interim boundaries.</s> <s i="18">On the West Bank, Abbas would need to convince Palestinians to accept the major post-1967 settlement blocs, perhaps offset by land swaps.</s> <s i="19">And the Israeli government would have to agree to a large-scale withdrawal from Judea and Samaria.</s> 

<s i="20">Once this very complex issue is resolved the leaders can turn their attention to the core identity and ideological issues.</s> <s i="21">During the 2000 Camp David summit, Yasser Arafat rejected the efforts to resolve Palestinian refugee claims and Jerusalem issues and accept a sovereign Jewish state.</s> <s i="22">Positions have hardened, and in the years of terrorism that followed, Israelis have become less willing to take risks or make fundamental concessions on these issues.</s> <s i="23">No conceivable Israeli government will agree to rewrite history by accepting moral responsibility for the 1948 Arab invasion and the resulting refugee problem, or to re-divide Jerusalem and again risk the eventual exclusion of Jews from their sacred sites.</s> 

<s i="24">Skeptics note that even if these obstacles could somehow be overcome and agreement reached, implementation is an entirely different and far more complex challenge.</s> <s i="25">Hamas will increase its denunciations of Abbas as a traitor to Arafat's legacy and the agreement will be rejected as lacking legitimacy, as in the case of the 1983 Lebanon-Israel Treaty.</s> <s i="26">In Israel, advisors and commentators warn of the possibility of a sudden rapprochement between Fateh and Hamas that would scuttle any agreement, while the settlement movement will fight intensively to prevent withdrawal from the heart of the historic Land of Israel.</s> <s i="27">In addition, as Defense Minister and Labor Party leader Ehud Barak has declared, the lessons of the Gaza and Lebanon withdrawals highlight the need for an effective anti-rocket defense system before Israel removes or reduces its security presence elsewhere.</s> <s i="28">Barak has ridiculed the suggestion that a peace agreement is imminent.</s>
