<s i="0">Most of the world's press, following the lead of the Israeli media, has declared in the past few days that the almost certain impending departure of Ariel Sharon from the political scene signals the end of an era.</s> <s i="1">With all due respect to the many wise commentators who feel this way, they are mistaken.</s> 

<s i="2">While Sharon may have been the most charismatic Israeli leader since David Ben Gurion, the founding father of the state, he himself did not found any sort of strategic approach that could bear his name--not even the unilateralism that he implemented so impressively.</s> <s i="3">Accordingly, his departure from the prime minister's office under sad circumstances does not mean the end of an era.</s> <s i="4">His departure will of course change, by definition, the name of the person who proceeds with the policy of unilaterally establishing facts that Sharon began.</s> <s i="5">Indeed, if that person is Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, then we can assert that at the ideological level it is he who holds more of a copyright on the ideas of unilateralism and uprooting settlements than Sharon.</s> <s i="6">He was recruiting adherents to this approach at a time when Sharon still resolutely opposed them.</s>

<s i="7">On the other hand, there certainly is a different political era in Israel.</s> <s i="8">You can almost sense it in the air.</s> <s i="9">Put simply, this new era tells us that there is no chance in the foreseeable future for an agreement with the Palestinians.</s> <s i="10">First, because the Oslo process--in which Israel undertook to allow the entry of some 40,000 armed Palestinians with their political and military leadership and to give the Palestinians an independent state in phases--ended up as a cruel war waged by suicide terrorists.</s> <s i="11">And second, because even Yasser Arafat's successor, Abu Mazen (President Mahmoud Abbas), never collected the weaponry of the mob, never ceased the terror even of the organizations linked to Fateh, the movement he heads, and hasn't fulfilled a single promise he made at Sharm al-Sheikh and in hundreds of public pronouncements.</s> <s i="12">Accordingly, more and more Israelis assert, let's take our fate in our hands without the agreement of others and decide unilaterally on the final borders of our country.</s>

<s i="13">This, then, is the national mood of recent years.</s> <s i="14">It was not Sharon who generated the overt and subterranean currents of thought that merged in the conclusion that there is no real option for dealing with the Palestinians save unilateralism.</s> <s i="15">On the contrary, in the last elections, just three years ago, Sharon opposed this view, poured disdain on Labor leader Amram Mitzna who proposed disengaging from just one settlement, Netzarim, and declared that the fate of Netzarim was the fate of Tel Aviv.</s> <s i="16">Only a year and half later, when terrorism persisted and more and more Israelis demanded to isolate themselves from it with walls and fences, did Sharon identify himself with those increasingly surging currents.</s> <s i="17">As an experienced surfer, he pointed the surfboard of his government in the direction of the flow.</s> <s i="18">And ever since he began to surf with the current rather than against it, as he had done for most of his adult life, he has been incorrectly identified as the formulator of the age of seclusion, separation and unilateralism.</s>

<s i="19">The fence, or wall as the world likes to call it, is more a unilateral creation even than disengagement.</s> <s i="20">Sharon, who understood its ramifications for the determination of future borders, resolutely opposed it.</s> <s i="21">Not, of course, for the reasons the Palestinians oppose it.</s> <s i="22">But in this case, too, when he discovered that the fence had a growing legion of supporters drunk with the atmosphere of unilateralism, he homed in on it and deployed his immense political and managerial skills to make it a reality.</s>

<s i="23">This analysis is important, not because of the credit that Sharon may or may not deserve for having or not having created the unilateralist current.</s> <s i="24">It is important, insofar as we are looking at the future rather than the past, because of the concern everyone is expressing lest &quot;the end of the Sharon era&quot; presage the end of the era of disengagement--the end, God forbid, of the uprooting of Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria.</s> <s i="25">It is this concern, and not consideration for the man's personal welfare, that defines left wing circles in Israel and leftists and centrists in the world.</s> <s i="26">This explains the huge credit and late love bestowed upon Sharon in recent years by those for whom he had been the most hated man in the world, even more than Saddam Hussein.</s>

<s i="27">Sharon, as commentator Dan Margalit correctly notes, was a talented and daring tactician, but not a strategist.</s> <s i="28">Sometimes, Margalit adds, his tactical moves became strategic because of the force and energies he invested in them.</s> <s i="29">That's what happened with the disengagement from Gaza.</s> <s i="30">When Sharon zeroed in on this tactical move, or on the fence--projects that no one but him had the political, personal and managerial strength to execute--that very execution changed the political and ideological way of life in Israel.</s> <s i="31">For all practical purposes the fence defines the future border of Israel, meaning that it leaves the majority of settlements outside the future boundary.</s> <s i="32">And the uprooting of settlements from Gaza is a precedent, according to which Jews can be removed from their homes by force.</s> <s i="33">Thus have the removal of settlements and the construction of the fence evolved from tactical to strategic acts.</s>
