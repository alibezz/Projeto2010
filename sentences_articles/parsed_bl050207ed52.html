<s i="0">These days mark a year since Hamas won parliamentary elections in the Palestinian Authority and established the new Palestinian government.</s> <s i="1">Hamas won totally free elections, a very rare event in the Arab world.</s> <s i="2">The elections were supported and even encouraged by the United States in accordance with its expressed policy of importing western democracy to the Middle East and even imposing it.</s> 

<s i="3">Neither the United States nor Israel, not to mention the ruling Palestinian Fateh government and the rest of the Arab world, predicted such a result.</s> <s i="4">It was reminiscent of Algeria in 1991, when the Front for Islamic Salvation were winning the first free elections ever held in the Arab world and then confronted a military dictatorship supported by France and the US.</s> <s i="5">In the case of Hamas, victory generated a global boycott, led by the US, aimed at strangling the new government until its slow death.</s> 

<s i="6">Thus the United States contradicted its stated policy.</s> <s i="7">It ignored the wishes of a significant Palestinian majority and the fact that Hamas' victory took place not only due to its terrorism against Israel, but primarily as a result of its social activism and its integrity in the eyes of the Palestinians.</s> <s i="8">Its victory also constituted an attempt to break the sense of siege and political dead-end in Palestine.</s> 

<s i="9">Yet the most significant element missed by the United States and Israel concerning Hamas' electoral triumph was the chance to create a process whereby, on the one hand, the local Hamas leadership would be released from the political chains of the past, and on the other, the gap between the local leadership and the external hard-line leaders in Damascus and Tehran would be widened.</s> 

<s i="10">What was the leadership status of Hamas in early 2006?</s> <s i="11">It entered the elections after about seven months of a hudna or (relative) ceasefire with Israel.</s> <s i="12">The veteran leadership was almost entirely dead; the movement did not have any prominent local leader; and the new ministers who formed the government were in fact a collective leadership of people hitherto involved only in the Hamas social infrastructure, alongside some technocrats.</s> <s i="13">Local figures such as Ismail Haniyeh and Mahmoud Zahar suddenly had a chance to promote themselves to positions of real leadership.</s> 

<s i="14">These factors bear emphasis insofar as they point to an element that has always been ignored by both Israel and the United States regarding Hamas.</s> <s i="15">The movement provides the only authentic social leadership in the PA and is the closest to the public.</s> <s i="16">Hamas has always been the most sensitive seismograph of the Palestinian mood, especially in Gaza, even as it has always attempted to move Palestinian public opinion toward its Islamic creed.</s> 

<s i="17">It has, in turn, also been shaped by the public.</s> <s i="18">The best example, an issue well understood by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, is Hamas' focus on local struggle only, within the boundaries of Palestine, and its prioritizing of withdrawal by Israel to the 1967 border and the establishment of an independent state.</s> <s i="19">These positions do not coincide with the movement's 1988 charter, its declared ideological slogans and the indoctrination of its cadres.</s> <s i="20">Hamas, it emerges, has placed pragmatic constraints upon itself in order always to keep the door open to the public's wishes.</s> 

<s i="21">In some ways, what happened with Hamas during the past year could be used as a script for a typical Middle Eastern movie.</s> <s i="22">A poor old maid receives a marriage proposal from someone she and the entire family regard as an old and ugly man.</s> <s i="23">Given her age, her family wants her to compromise and marry at whatever price.</s> <s i="24">They hate the future groom, but at the same time they know that he is the only possible candidate and they could benefit from the marriage.</s> <s i="25">She wants to get married but cannot make up her mind, and dares not say anything to her family or the potential groom.</s> <s i="26">In the meantime, her wealthy brother who lives in the big city free of local family pressures is doing his best to prevent the marriage and calls upon her to resist.</s> <s i="27">Is there a happy ending?</s> <s i="28">We shall all have to wait... and wait..., because no one is willing to produce the film.</s> 

<s i="29">Similarly, in the course of 2006 there was a chance that Hamas would become more pragmatic in return for satisfaction of one of the most important elements of the Palestinian mindset: recognition--recognition of its legitimate victory, its status as representative of the Palestinian public and its right to make its own decisions.</s> <s i="30">Yet the reality of the past year was that Israel, the United States, most of the Arab world including the Saudis, and Europe--albeit with a lot of reservations--joined in pushing the Hamas local collective leadership into the arms of Iran, Khaled Meshaal and other hard-liners who in turn presented themselves as the only defenders of the Palestinian people.</s> <s i="31">Now, in early 2007, we confront civil strife in the PA that will lead nowhere.</s> 

<s i="32">The Israeli-Palestinian conflict cannot be solved by means of a short process in which the lines of a final settlement are sketched out, as some suggest.</s> <s i="33">It will take Hamas years to recognize the existence of Israel or to abandon violent jihad as the core of its ideology.</s> <s i="34">Yet we should be testing Hamas by its deeds rather than its ideology; by its practical behavior, not its dreams.</s> 

<s i="35">The Palestinians in general are more practical than other Arab publics.</s> <s i="36">They have the power to impose this practicality upon the uncharismatic local Hamas leadership, if only it can be released from its Iranian chains.</s> <s i="37">This in turn can be accomplished by allowing Hamas to exercise its legitimate rule and ceasing the boycott of the movement.</s> <s i="38">This would push the Palestinian people to encourage Hamas to adopt a more pragmatic line.</s>
