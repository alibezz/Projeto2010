<s i="0">There is no doubt that the outbreak of violence between Israelis and Palestinians in September 2000 was related directly or indirectly to the collapse of the peace process after the failure of the Camp David final status summit.</s> 

<s i="1">But it would be a mistake to see the start of the Aqsa intifada as something that happened in the context only of this failure.</s> <s i="2">The Oslo process was meant to usher in a period of non-peace/non-war to enable the settling of the core issues between the sides.</s> <s i="3">But it is difficult to imagine such a situation holding too long in a conflict like the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, simply because the Israeli occupation is a continuous act of aggression and oppression that invites rejection and resistance.</s>  

<s i="4">It is important to note that before the outbreak of confrontations that September there had not been any act of Palestinian violence against Israelis in the four preceding years, as was pointed out then by Israeli journalist Danny Rubinstein.</s> <s i="5">One might add that these four years without violence were the only such period of extended calm since the beginning of the Israeli occupation in 1967.</s> 

<s i="6">Israel has recently succeeded in creating the impression--the false impression--that the confrontations are about Palestinian-initiated violence and Israeli reaction.</s> <s i="7">If one goes back to the beginning of this phase, however, and looks into the details of those events the opposite conclusion must be drawn.</s> 

<s i="8">The first bloody day of this phase came the day after then Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon's provocative visit to the Aqsa Mosque surrounded by some 1,500 security personnel and policemen.</s> <s i="9">Palestinian protests were met with draconian violence by the Israeli security forces, and seven Palestinians were killed in or around the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.</s> <s i="10">That set the pattern for the first few weeks of the intifada.</s> <s i="11">Popular, unarmed demonstrations were met with extreme violence, and the record shows that for the first ten days of the intifada an average of ten Palestinians were killed each day, with almost no casualties on the other side.</s> <s i="12">There were also 13 casualties in one day, not in Gaza, Nablus or Jenin, but among Palestinian youth in the Galilee and Palestinian-Israeli towns during demonstrations in solidarity with their brethren in the West Bank and Gaza.</s>  

<s i="13">The first Palestinian suicide bombing did not come until six months later, and in the following months and years the confrontations started to gain their own dynamic.</s> <s i="14">A cycle was born, a chain of action and reaction whereby specifying cause and effect became less and less intelligible.</s> <s i="15">It is always important to remember, however, that this cycle took place, and continues to take place, in the context of an illegal, military and belligerent Israeli occupation of Palestinian land.</s>  

<s i="16">The events of September 11 also provided Israel an opportunity to classify these confrontations as part of the war between the civilized world and terrorism.</s> <s i="17">It is a public relations tactic that seems to have succeeded and allowed Israel to continue its path of uncompromising and unilateral action.</s> <s i="18">This is unfortunate, when the main lesson that should have been learned so far is that there is no way Palestinians can live peacefully while living under occupation.</s> <s i="19">The means employed in the war between occupied and occupiers can change, and sometimes they may be perceived as legitimate and at other times as illegitimate.</s> <s i="20">But at all times, the occupation--especially as it is accompanied by ever-expanding illegal Jewish settlement on Palestinian land aimed at consolidating this occupation--will always cause resistance, violence and confrontation.</s>
