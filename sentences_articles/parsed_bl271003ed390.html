<s i="0">The significance of the Geneva Accord is that it has brought Palestinians and Israelis back to the political track, securing the continuity of the process that began with the Madrid peace conference.</s> <s i="1">In a way, too, it has further narrowed the gaps between the two sides on the substantial issues of the conflict such as borders, refugees, Jerusalem and security.</s> 

<s i="2">While there are some that have dismissed the plan after its flat rejection by the Israeli government, the fact that the government of Israel stands vociferously opposed to the accord actually means little.</s> <s i="3">No sensible politician believes that the political process can possibly continue under the current Israeli right wing leadership.</s> <s i="4">This government comes from an ideological and strategic position that is completely contrary to all of the peace process terms of reference, especially international law.</s> <s i="5">Therefore, if the peace process is to progress in official channels, we will have to wait for the arrival of a government in Israel that is not hostile in principle to the basic tenets of any peace process that has the hopes of succeeding, the most important of these tenets being ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</s> 

<s i="6">One might even go further and hold up the current Israeli government position against the Geneva Accord as proof that the Israeli government is elevating its narrow ideological interests above the interests of the Israeli people.</s> <s i="7">Even when the Palestinians who negotiated this document showed flexibility over the sticky resolution to the Palestinian refugee issue, still the Israeli government turned up its nose.</s> <s i="8">Indeed, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his ideological bedfellows will do their best to avoid giving up their control over the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip because they believe not that this land is occupied but, as Sharon put it bluntly not long ago, it is the rightful homeland of the Jewish people.</s> <s i="9">In short, that view contradicts the aims of any peace process based on international legality and supported by the international community.</s> 

<s i="10">The Geneva Accord, which should be perceived as another step in an ongoing political process aimed at reaching an agreement between the official representatives of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, has finally brought back discussion and debate as to the substance of the conflict.</s> <s i="11">For too long, the two sides have labored in ongoing hypocrisy over logistic, security and administrative issues.</s> <s i="12">While these may be important, their negotiation consumes the parties and prevents them from discussing the political issues that require debate in order to narrow the gaps between the two sides.</s> <s i="13">Indeed, this debate is the only way to move towards peace.</s> <s i="14">It is important that the peace camps in Israel and Palestine use the Geneva process and document to regroup, because the future compromise between the different groups on the two sides should be based on these substantially improved positions.</s> 

<s i="15">That is not to say that these improvements have reached the point of perfection.</s> <s i="16">The actual text requires more tweaking and work, however, as those efforts are pursued, there is no doubt that when the two official governments sit for final status negotiations, they will benefit greatly from the ideas embodied in the Geneva Accord.</s> <s i="17">All that is required is the closing of some holes and finalizing of some important contours before the accord and all it represents can be actualized.</s>
