<s i="0">Until a government coalition is determined, it is difficult to speculate with any precision about future policies.</s> <s i="1">The only real question is whether Kadima will be part of a Netanyahu government; all the other parties to the likely coalition are either extreme right, religious right or both.</s> <s i="2">The overall shift to the right of the Israeli public--the result to a large degree of frustration over past, failed peace attempts and the ever stronger belief that &quot;there is no partner&quot; nor is there a possibility for peace--has rendered the political left impotent and desolate.</s> <s i="3">The election results suggest that the majority of Israelis accept the notion that the failure of the use of force means only that more force must be used.</s> <s i="4">And this, of course, does not bode well.</s>

<s i="5">Two things that may be expected from the new government are expanded settlement construction and severe responses to Palestinian violence.</s> <s i="6">Yet there are restraints.</s> <s i="7">Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu presents himself to the world as an urbane, rational leader.</s> <s i="8">Particularly with regard to US President Barack Obama, Netanyahu may wish to avoid the appearance of deviation from the overall policy accepted by America's far less interested previous government, namely continuation of some kind of peace process.</s> 

<s i="9">Given the risk of alienating the new US administration from the outset, Netanyahu presumably will avoid precipitous moves such as refusing to continue negotiations with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen)--or indirectly with the Syrians.</s> <s i="10">He has already said that he is not bound by whatever may have been previously discussed--no agreements were actually produced by the outgoing Olmert government--so he is free to continue talking, indefinitely.</s> <s i="11">Similarly, he will introduce his own formula for the territories, &quot;economic peace,&quot; although it is difficult to see just what this can achieve without opening of checkpoints, thereby easing the movement of goods and people in the West Bank.</s>

<s i="12">Much will depend on the reaction of the Americans.</s> <s i="13">In the case of Washington, gentle prodding by means of Obama's representative George Mitchell might turn into actual pressure.</s> <s i="14">Washington has a real interest in changing its position in the region, beginning possibly with Syria but involving interests in Iran--both connected with Iraq--and to some degree dependent upon weakening the power of the Palestinian issue as an instrument of radicalization in the region.</s> <s i="15">Thus Washington's regional approach could lead to pressures for some kind of Israeli move forward.</s> <s i="16">Some believe this might focus on Syria; it might also produce some kind of partial, hitherto unknown measure of movement on the Palestinian issue.</s> 

<s i="17">American pressure would have the potential to accomplish more if met by similar pressure from inside Israel.</s> <s i="18">The decimation of the political left in these elections makes that appear unlikely.</s> <s i="19">Yet it is just this situation, and the alarmingly extremist tint of the expected coalition, that may finally bring the left or the so-called peace camp back to life.</s> <s i="20">Out of power, and possibly with Kadima in the opposition (and therefore bound to attack the government for forsaking the peace path ostensibly pursued by Tzipi Livni), this side of the spectrum may find its voice again.</s> 

<s i="21">Settlements and the demographic issue are the two matters upon which there is general support for the center-left.</s> <s i="22">We mustn't forget that it was a wish to get on with our lives and livelihoods in peace--separated from the Palestinians--that led the majority of Israelis to agree to compromise and to the two-state solution.</s> <s i="23">This attitude has not changed.</s> <s i="24">And it is with regard to this issue that there may actually be differing positions within Netanyahu's coalition.</s>
