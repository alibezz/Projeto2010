<s i="0">I was astounded by the subject of this issue of bitterlemons, i.e. the role of intellectuals in the peace process.</s> <s i="1">My gut reaction was to decline and abstain from writing the essay.</s> <s i="2">In fact, the topic is filled with hypothetical assumptions, which I believe cannot be used as valid bases for exploring the subject.</s> <s i="3">It is impossible to attain a procedural definition of this issue and discuss it according to specific criteria.</s> 

<s i="4">However, once I thought the matter through, I decided to wonder about the issue, rather than discuss it.</s> <s i="5">The reason I accepted after my initial hesitation was the need to explore the concept that a specific role for intellectuals actually exists, not only in the political process, but also in other areas.</s> <s i="6">Do intellectuals have a specific, predefined function that they should be aware of and act out as one solid bloc?</s> 

<s i="7">If the hidden pretension underlying my question is &quot;yes&quot;--i.e. that such a role actually exists--this undoubtedly leads us to a series of questions that must be answered clearly, in order to be able to define the subject: Who is the intellectual?</s> <s i="8">What makes he or she one?</s> <s i="9">Should the intellectual define him or herself or be defined as such?</s> <s i="10">Do intellectuals form a specific, clearly defined and integral social category?</s> <s i="11">Do they need to have unified principles, visions and modus operandi?</s> <s i="12">Do they need to have their own positions, independent from those of their societies?</s> 

<s i="13">I am of the mind that the term &quot;intellectual&quot; is a vague concept, although it might include some common general characteristics.</s> <s i="14">My &quot;intellectual&quot; may not be considered as such by someone else, because the matter is purely subjective.</s> <s i="15">The definition is beholden more to personal evaluation than to objective standardization.</s> <s i="16">(Is everyone holding a university degree considered an intellectual?) Intellectuals do not constitute a special social category.</s> <s i="17">They are an integral part of the social fabric.</s> <s i="18">Some of them come from underprivileged classes while others are clearly upper-class.</s> <s i="19">Some are secular, others deeply religious.</s> <s i="20">Some are right-wingers, others leftists.</s> <s i="21">Some are progressives, others conservative.</s> <s i="22">Some are rural, still others city-dwellers, and so on.</s> <s i="23">Hence, intellectuals do not share unified principles, visions and modus operandi.</s> <s i="24">Neither they, nor their beliefs, may be squeezed together, and pointed in one singular direction.</s> <s i="25">On the contrary, because they are an integral part of the social fabric, they reflect a wide variety of principles, visions, and tendencies.</s> 

<s i="26">Indeed, because they are intellectuals, their trademark is one of conflicting positions.</s> <s i="27">Consequently, there is no such thing as a singular &quot;point on the compass&quot; for the actions of intellectuals, and it is impossible to issue a judgment on which trend is better than another.</s> <s i="28">Heterogeneity--and not homogeneity--being the basic factor affecting the positions of those we call &quot;intellectuals&quot;, the principle that rules their differences is the multiplicity and variety of their interests.</s> <s i="29">Each intellectual, in his or her capacity as a member of society, has interests that might correlate with, or work against, the interests of others.</s> <s i="30">Thus, achieving these interests is what guides the &quot;intellectual�s&quot; course of action.</s> 

<s i="31">If the above is true, then there is no basis for this subject that I was asked to write about--unless it is in someone�s interest to direct the role of intellectuals in a given direction.</s> <s i="32">This way, intellectuals might be encouraged to adopt a so-called &quot;positive role&quot; in pushing the peace process forward!</s> <s i="33">If this is truly the motive, it reduces the intellectuals� breadth of variety.</s> <s i="34">It also introduces a value judgment categorizing intellectuals as &quot;those who are with&quot; and &quot;those who are against.&quot;</s> <s i="35">Intellectuals that believe in the process will be deemed &quot;good intellectuals.&quot;</s> <s i="36">But those who have reservations about, or are expressly opposed to the process will be labeled &quot;bad intellectuals,&quot; if they are lucky.</s> <s i="37">In fact, they may be ousted from the intellectuals� list and--in this world of &quot;those who are not with us are against us&quot;--squeezed onto the list of agitators or even terrorists.</s> 

<s i="38">There are intellectuals whose interests lie with the political process, who use their position in a variety of roles to support that process.</s> <s i="39">By doing so, they not only express their position, but that of all social groups that see their own interests advanced by the political process.</s> <s i="40">On the other hand, there are also skeptics, or those who oppose the process, and whose positions are consequently at odds with those parties who disagree.</s> <s i="41">In this way, intellectuals, be they pro- or anti-settlement, do have a role to play.</s> 

<s i="42">But if we truly believe in democracy, it is the people�s choice that must prevail.</s> <s i="43">What we really need to know is who will convince the majority of the righteousness of his or her position--not who will seek to impose his or her beliefs on others.</s>
