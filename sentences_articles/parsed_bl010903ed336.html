<s i="0">&quot;Is the roadmap dead?&quot;</s> <s i="1">Before addressing this question, one may remember that many observers, including myself, maintained all along that in its present form there were too many &quot;holes&quot; in it to make it work.</s> <s i="2">It suffices to mention the unworkable timetables or the absence of what Israel sees as an absolute must--the annulment of the so-called &quot;right of return.&quot;</s> <s i="3">Even the &quot;vision&quot; of a &quot;democratic, viable Palestinian state&quot; living in peace alongside Israel, inevitably raises the question of why the projected Palestinian state should be different from most other Arab states?</s>

<s i="4">However, the most substantial issue is the imperative to stop Palestinian terror and violence.</s> <s i="5">This was especially important to Israelis after the abject failure of the Oslo agreement, the breakdown of the Barak-Clinton initiative at Camp David, and the outbreak of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat�s &quot;al Aqsa intifada&quot;.</s> <s i="6">The current Israeli government thus sees the end of terror as crucial for a meaningful political process.</s> <s i="7">This was reinforced, both in Israel and in the US, after 9/11 and the Bush administration�s clear and unequivocal stand against terrorism.</s> <s i="8">The roadmap, in spite of several attempts by members of the Quartet to shift the emphasis, mandated clearly that the Palestinian Authority must begin &quot;sustained, targeted and effective operations&quot; to dismantle terrorist infrastructure, etc. None of that happened.</s>  <s i="9">Instead, the Palestinian Authority concluded a temporary ceasefire (hudna) with Hamas and Islamic Jihad that was used by those groups as a breather to regroup and rearm, and it soon became evident that the terror groups did not regard the hudna as an absolute stop to violence--nor did Arafat.</s>

<s i="10">At the time of writing, the internal Palestinian political situation is far from clear, and the outcome of the crisis is bound to have an impact on the future of the roadmap.</s> <s i="11">Another important element is the currently insufficient concrete support the &quot;map&quot; enjoys from the Arab world.</s> <s i="12">As Dennis Ross recently wrote: &quot;Prime Minister Abbas needs the cover of Arab legitimacy to confront Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the al-Aqsa Brigades.&quot;</s>

<s i="13">The usual Palestinian explanation for failing to act against the terrorists is that they do not want to risk civil war, though it is far from clear whether a more determined action would in fact have led to civil war--or whether this argument is but a subterfuge to refrain from action.</s> <s i="14">Be this as it may, Israelis wonder whether the present Palestinian political crisis is not just a contest between Arafat who doesn�t want to deliver and Abbas who can�t (or at least doesn�t want to get his feet wet in trying to deliver).</s> <s i="15">Paradoxically, Israel�s renewed military operations against the terrorists might now give the roadmap a new lease on life--with Israel doing the Palestinians &quot;dirty work&quot;.</s> <s i="16">Though Washington has few remaining illusions about the Abbas government, it has not given up on it yet, but it has left no doubt as to where the main responsibility lies for the crisis in the roadmap.</s> 

<s i="17">&quot;But what about the settlements?&quot;</s> <s i="18">Though this subject must indeed come up sooner or later, the equation between stopping terror and freezing settlements looks to most Israelis disingenuous.</s> <s i="19">On the other hand, had the Palestinian Authority lived up to its primary obligations with regard to fighting terror, this would have put the onus for continuing the process squarely on Israel.</s> <s i="20">At present, Prime Minister Sharon, facing increasing opposition from inside his own party and coalition with regard to several aspects of the roadmap, is not even required to face some of the more difficult decisions in it.</s>

<s i="21">The Bush administration�s Middle East policy was based on three interrelated points: victory in Iraq, reform and democratization of the Arab world, and &quot;solving&quot; the Arab-Jewish conflict.</s> <s i="22">After years of America projecting an image of being a &quot;paper tiger&quot;, Middle Easterners looked in awe, though not always with glee, at America�s decisive and swift military victory over Saddam Hussein.</s> 
 <s i="23">Basically, this attitude has not yet changed.</s> <s i="24">The &quot;link&quot; between America�s enhanced position and the Palestinian-Israeli equation was that Palestinians were given to understand that only if they renounced terror, and only with American support, could they realize part of their aspirations.</s> <s i="25">Palestinians also hoped that given America�s overall design for the Middle East, pressure would be put on Israel to make concessions beyond those the latter was ready to make.</s> <s i="26">However, as long as Palestinian terror continues--especially with Yasir Arafat trying to reassume absolute power--the chances for this scenario to materialize are highly doubtful, even without involving ourselves in American domestic politics.</s>

<s i="27">Much will indeed depend on how the US pursues its aims with regard to Iraq.</s> <s i="28">America�s precipitate withdrawal, 20 years ago, from Beirut led to decades of losing face in the Middle East--and indirectly to many of the region�s upheavals.</s> <s i="29">But Iraq and creating a durable framework for Persian Gulf and regional security are far more important than Beirut ever was!</s> <s i="30">Palestinians, like others in the Middle East, will therefore carefully watch how the US deals with the Iraqi situation--and draw their conclusions accordingly.</s>

<s i="31">So, is there still a chance for the roadmap?</s> <s i="32">Though some argue that it was stillborn in the first place, one could also make a case that after some thorough retooling it could yet lead to positive results.</s> <s i="33">Setting the sights a bit lower, and provided the difficult first stage can be overcome, the &quot;map&quot; could still function as a general compass to bring the two sides to a long-term &quot;modus vivendi&quot; which, though short of solving all the outstanding issues (e.g., Jerusalem, holy places, or the final borders of the future Palestinian entity) would nevertheless put an end to violence and give the two peoples an extended period of calm and prosperity.</s> 

<s i="34">Full fledged idyllic &quot;comprehensive&quot; peace between Israel and the Palestinians will probably have to wait for generational changes--but, after all, this would not be so different from what history has shown in other parts of the world, including Europe: first pragmatic arrangements and only then permanent peace.</s>
