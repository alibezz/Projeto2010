<s i="0">The process of finding a successor to the late President Yasser Arafat will culminate on January 9, and it is with a great deal of pride that the Palestinian people look forward to these elections.</s> 

<s i="1">And for good reason.</s> <s i="2">Elections, a somewhat unusual practice in the Arab world, seem to be taken for granted by all Palestinians, whether among the general public or the political elite.</s> <s i="3">And while one reason for this is the constitutional obligation to hold presidential elections, another important reason is that in the absence of a personality that can fill the shoes of such a charismatic and historical political leader as Arafat, Palestinians are looking to political institutions and legal processes to fill part of the vacancy he left behind.</s> 

<s i="4">However, holding elections requires more than just Palestinian readiness and a decree from the interim president.</s> <s i="5">Requirements apply to other parties that are no less important.</s> <s i="6">Specifically, Israel, having by force retaken control over most of the Palestinian territories, needs to fulfill three basic requirements for elections to be possible as well as free and democratic:

First, the Palestinian people should enjoy the natural right of free movement, free political expression and free political organization.</s>

<s i="7">Second, there has to be complete Palestinian Authority control over all PA areas.</s> <s i="8">In other words, Israel has to withdraw its forces from PA areas and stop its incursions, assassinations and arrest campaigns in these territories.</s> 

<s i="9">Third, all Palestinians in the occupied territories, that is the Gaza Strip and the West Bank including East Jerusalem, must enjoy full right of participation in the elections.</s>

<s i="10">These requirements are not new.</s> <s i="11">They are stipulations of the elections protocol, which was one of the chapters of the Oslo II interim agreement.</s>

<s i="12">The international community must also meet certain obligations to ensure that elections take place and are free and democratic.</s> <s i="13">There needs to be extensive international monitoring with two objectives: first to ensure that elections are free and democratic in terms of the way they are being run and managed by the Palestinian Authority; second, to monitor and protect the elections from possible Israeli harassment or restrictions.</s> <s i="14">Indeed, the international community needs to play an immediate role to convince Israel to abide by the necessary requirements to enable elections.</s> 

<s i="15">International economic support is also important for maintaining the stability of the political structure of the Palestinian Authority.</s> <s i="16">It is important to maintain people's confidence in the Palestinian political regime.</s> <s i="17">The economic deterioration--the high unemployment and rising levels of poverty--has contributed to political instability and radicalization within Palestinian society.</s>

<s i="18">Needless to say, there are also other obligations on the Palestinian side, mainly to maintain law and order within the different Palestinian communities, especially when and if the Israeli army evacuates such areas.</s>
