<s i="0">There is an intriguing theory making the rounds; it argues that a second term Bush presidency will address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict more energetically and aggressively.</s> <s i="1">According to this line of thought, President George W. Bush has for some time been unhappy with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's performance, particularly on the settlements.</s> <s i="2">In addition, Bush is aware of the need to &quot;deliver&quot; on the Palestinian issue in order to placate Arab and European allies who are deeply troubled over the unfolding course of events in Iraq as well as in Palestine.</s> <s i="3">Besides, he is the first American president to officially endorse the creation of a Palestinian state, and he means what he says.</s>

<s i="4">In a second term, so the theory goes, Bush will be far less beholden to extreme pro-Israel lobbies like the evangelical Christians that support him.</s> <s i="5">Finally, with Yasser Arafat apparently out of the way, an additional obstacle to deeper Bush administration involvement will have been removed.</s>

<s i="6">I am skeptical regarding this scenario--particularly during the coming year.</s> <s i="7">For one, it assumes that Bush really would like to get involved in Arab-Israel peacemaking, even though nothing he has done or said in the past four years reflects such a predisposition.</s> <s i="8">More significantly, Bush's Middle East agenda will be dominated, as before, by Iraq: he has to make the American experiment there look good while removing American troops from harm's way.</s> <s i="9">The few serious allies the US has in Iraq are not preoccupied with the linkage between Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian issue.</s> <s i="10">Or, if they are, as in the case of PM Tony Blair of the UK who is under strong political pressure at home, their efforts to implement the roadmap will be dispensed with by Bush at the rhetorical and symbolic levels: a White House statement, an international conference.</s>

<s i="11">As for the moderate Arab leaders, Bush appears to have accepted the argument of his neo-conservative advisers that they are paper tigers and that the threat posed by the &quot;Arab street&quot; is a bluff.</s> <s i="12">Everything he presumes to have learned in the past 18 months since the occupation began tells him that Iraq comes before Palestine.</s>

<s i="13">Second on Bush's agenda of Middle East priorities is Iran, which is assessed to be only months away from a point-of-no-return in developing nuclear weaponry.</s> <s i="14">Bush will be determined in his first year to stop the Iranians--either through international sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council in concert with the other major powers, or by preempting militarily against the Iranian nuclear project.</s> <s i="15">The latter course of action would undoubtedly have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the Middle East--but that is a separate issue.</s>

<s i="16">Third, and only third on Bush's agenda is the Arab-Israel conflict, and in particular the Israeli-Palestinian issues.</s> <s i="17">Bush has endorsed Sharon's disengagement plan; as long as it is seen to be progressing, Sharon is not likely to be pressured to do more than dismantle a few outposts.</s> <s i="18">Bush will wait until after a first round of settlement dismantling and IDF withdrawal from Gaza and the northern West Bank before assessing whether a renewed peace process is possible.</s> <s i="19">In the meantime he'll focus US pressure on any new Palestinian leadership to deliver on security in Gaza.</s> <s i="20">On the other hand if disengagement fails, the almost certain corollary will be new Israeli elections during 2005--another deterrent to American pressure or energetic involvement.</s> <s i="21">One way or another, we find ourselves approaching the 2006 US mid-term elections, when Bush won't want to rock the boat for the Republican majority in both houses of Congress.</s>

<s i="22">Here it behooves us to recall that, in the post-9/11 period, George W. Bush has, for better or for worse, revolutionized American Middle East strategy.</s> <s i="23">For the first time in years, the Arab-Israel conflict is not the primary focus of US policy.</s> <s i="24">Instead, the focus is Washington's perception of the Middle East as a failed region that is the origin Islamic fanaticism and possibly a base for weapons of mass destruction aimed at the United States, thereby obliging the US to preempt militarily and strike at the heart of the region in order to reform it.</s> 

<s i="25">There is little room in this concept for the Israel-Arab conflict; beyond Washington's neglect of the Palestinian issue, note how indifferent it has been to Syria's attempts to renew its peace process with Israel.</s> <s i="26">There is nothing to indicate that in Bush's second term this grand strategy is going to change.</s>
