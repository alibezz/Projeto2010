<s i="0">The scenes this week of tens of thousands of Palestinians streaming across the Egyptian border speak eloquently to the levels of despair in the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="1">The situation has indeed reached a crisis point, with most businesses shut down due to a lack of raw materials or ability to export, and some 80 percent of the Strip's 1.4 million people dependent on food relief from the international community.</s> <s i="2">Most recently, the poverty has been compounded by disruptions in the electricity and fuel supply, imposing additional hardships for families trying to get through the winter and putting at risk all the systems that depend on electricity and fuel, including water pumping, sewage treatment and the functioning of hospitals.</s>  

<s i="3">This situation is not the result of an earthquake or some other natural disaster.</s> <s i="4">It is the direct consequence of intentional Israeli measures.</s> <s i="5">Following the Hamas takeover in June 2007, Israel closed its border crossings into Gaza and also ensured that the Rafah crossing into Egypt stayed closed.</s> <s i="6">The Gaza Strip is a tiny economy, heavily dependent on the outside world for import of raw materials and basic goods and export of everything Gaza produces.</s> <s i="7">Yet Israel completely halted all exports out of Gaza and only allowed import of the most essential humanitarian supplies.</s> <s i="8">Even many people in need of urgent medical care inside Israel--cancer patients, heart patients, children with cystic fibrosis--were denied the necessary permits or turned back at the Erez crossing.</s> 

<s i="9">In September, as Palestinian militants continued to fire Qassam rockets into southern Israel, Israel escalated the sanctions on Gaza to include disruptions in the supply of electricity and fuel.</s> <s i="10">Last week, the Palestinian Electric Company totally shut down the power station, citing a lack of fuel necessary to operate it.</s> <s i="11">As a result, the power supply in the Gaza Strip was cut by 32 percent, causing a widespread blackout.</s> <s i="12">The power station supplies electricity to Gaza's largest medical facility, Shifa Hospital, as well as the sewage treatment facility in Gaza City and dozens of wells, sewage pumps, medical clinics and schools.</s> <s i="13">As electricity is needed to pump water, residents also suffered severe cutbacks in water supply.</s> 

<s i="14">This Israeli siege was broken suddenly and dramatically with the toppling of the Rafah fence, separating Gaza from Egypt.</s> <s i="15">Although this somewhat alleviates Gaza's sense of strangulation, an economy cannot function through a hole in a fence.</s> <s i="16">The Gaza Strip economy is extremely dependent on Israel--in its 38 years of direct occupation, Israel intentionally made it so.</s> <s i="17">Since disengagement, Gaza has not been allowed to develop independently, as Israel controls its air space and territorial waters, all imports and exports, the taxation system and even the population registry.</s> 

<s i="18">Israel claims that it cannot relinquish this control, given the rocket fire and weapons smuggling.</s> <s i="19">This may be the case; the question is how Israel wields its control?</s>

<s i="20">Residents of Sderot and the rest of southern Israel also have a right to live in safety, a right they have not enjoyed for years.</s> <s i="21">Qassam rocket fire has killed 11 people inside Israel since 2004, and forced entire communities to live in fear.</s> <s i="22">Israel has the obligation to protect this population, but not by any means whatsoever.</s> <s i="23">In fact, our limitations are precisely what distinguish us from the terrorists.</s> <s i="24">Not every means is legitimate to protect residents of Sderot, and intentionally inflicting harm on Palestinian civilians is where we must draw the line.</s> <s i="25">Sadly, Israel has not respected this distinction.</s> 

<s i="26">The siege on Gaza and the disruptions to the fuel supply are illegal and immoral.</s> <s i="27">The vague statements that these measures are intended to only harm the militants cannot obscure the fact that the intention is to pressure Hamas by causing its civilian population to suffer.</s> <s i="28">These are collective punishments, explicitly prohibited by international humanitarian law.</s>
