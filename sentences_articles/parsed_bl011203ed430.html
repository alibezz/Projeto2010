<s i="0">The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has always been strongly tied to the political agenda of the United States.</s> <s i="1">That is only one manifestation of both sides' unusually deep dependence on external actors.</s> <s i="2">Time and time again, it has been shown that when the parties are left without a minimum of attention from the outside (the US especially) political and security deterioration results.</s> <s i="3">The only times that we have witnessed progress, on the other hand, were those in which the US and other countries exerted special efforts towards making agreements, implementing them, or controlling otherwise explosive situations.</s> 

<s i="4">As such, there may be no time more difficult for us than the coming year.</s> <s i="5">The United States' elections, American involvement in Iraq, Arab disengagement for all sorts of reasons including the war, the rise to power of the most extreme right-wing government in the history of Israel and finally, the shift in the balance of power within Palestinian society against the peace camp, a shift born of the absence of any genuine political prospect and Israel's systematic efforts to dismantle the Palestinian Authority as the standard bearer of Palestinian moderation, are all foreboding signs.</s>

<s i="6">Elections in the United States affect the conflict in several ways.</s> <s i="7">Mainly, the American administration will focus on internal American politics, thus neglecting its political investments in the Middle East.</s> <s i="8">Second, since the Middle East is controversial in American politics, and because of the significance of pro-Israel Jewish votes and their accompanying campaign finance contributions, the administration will avoid drawing attention to the Middle East just to avoid any missteps.</s> <s i="9">That is particularly so these days, as any American-proposed solutions are liable to require placing pressure on the Israeli government and exposing public differences.</s> <s i="10">One example of this is the recent US decision to deduct nearly $300 million in loan guarantees from US funds to Israel because of Israel's decision to continue to build its wall.</s> <s i="11">At the moment, at least, the ball appears to be in Israel's court.</s> 

<s i="12">On the Palestinian side, the climate is increasingly conducive to peacemaking.</s> <s i="13">There is a new and approved government, a good working relationship between the president and prime minister, and quite hopeful Egyptian-Palestinian efforts towards a comprehensive ceasefire including all of the Palestinian factions.</s> 

<s i="14">Israel, on the other hand, has continued building the apartheid/separation wall despite the United Nations vote of 144 countries condemning the wall, and in spite of the public American criticism.</s> <s i="15">Israel insists on expanding its illegal Jewish settlements built in occupied territory and land that is owned by Palestinian individuals who still have the land deeds of ownership.</s> <s i="16">It also continues to impose checkpoints that are responsible for transforming Palestinian life into misery and humiliating all alike.</s> <s i="17">In order to move forward, the United States will have to pressure Israel, and conventional wisdom says that pressuring Israel is impossible in an election year.</s>

<s i="18">The vacuum certain to result is a terribly dangerous one.</s> <s i="19">This Israel government has demonstrated that, barring any damage to its relationship with the United States, there are no limits to the extent to which it will harm Palestinians and the cause of peace (this Israeli government's short-sighted policies have even done significant damage to Israel's image abroad).</s> 

<s i="20">Therefore, in order to avoid catastrophe in this critical next year, other major world players, in full coordination with the United States government if possible, must step to the plate.</s> <s i="21">The obvious candidates are the Quartet, the European Union or even just Britain, all of whom have shown themselves useful in previous tough times.</s>
