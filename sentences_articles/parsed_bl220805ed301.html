<s i="0">The starting point when looking at the legal status of any part of the Palestinian territories, including the Gaza Strip, is that the occupied Palestinian territories are, legally speaking, one integral unit.</s> <s i="1">This is how the Oslo agreements, which were endorsed by the United Nations and recognized officially by all countries, defined the Palestinian territories.</s>

<s i="2">This means it is not possible to deal with the legal status of any part of this integral territory except in relation to the rest.</s> <s i="3">There is a clear definition of independence, or end of occupation in our case, that requires an end to foreign control over the area under consideration, including over the borders and sea- and airspace.</s> <s i="4">In the case of the Gaza Strip, which constitutes four to five percent of the Palestinian territories, and according to the only legal document Israel has issued regarding the disengagement plan, the borders of Gaza will remain under Israeli control, as will its air space.</s> 

<s i="5">The seriousness of Israeli intentions to properly leave the Gaza Strip will be judged on what happens with borders and crossing points.</s> <s i="6">So far the Palestinian side has two basic fears: the first is what the arrangements concerning movement between Gaza and the West Bank will be, and the second concerns movement between the Gaza Strip and the outside world and vice versa.</s> <s i="7">These are the aspects that most decisively will shape the political, economic and legal scenarios after disengagement.</s> 

<s i="8">One nightmare scenario is if Israel opens the Egyptian-Palestinian border at Rafah but does not allow movement between the West Bank and Gaza.</s> <s i="9">Such a situation will negatively affect aspirations for one state comprising both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="10">It also contradicts with the vision of US President George W. Bush and the position of the international community for a two-state solution.</s> <s i="11">Gaza and the West Bank are one economy and, according to Oslo, are thus subject to the same customs arrangements.</s> <s i="12">Should Gaza be severed from the West Bank, two customs arrangements and two pricing systems will arise that will gradually create two different economies.</s> 

<s i="13">The international community seems to be aware of this possible danger and is working hard to convince Israel to maintain the integrity of the West Bank and Gaza as one economy and one political entity.</s> <s i="14">The outcome of the current negotiations that Israel is holding with Egypt and many other parties including the US, the World Bank, the PA, and the EU, will be crucial in this regard.</s> <s i="15">These negotiations have been concentrating on the issue of movement through the crossing points to Egypt and through Israel to the West Bank.</s> <s i="16">Palestinians and Egyptians, who have been trying to ensure a complete end to the Israeli presence in Gaza including on the Egypt-Gaza borders, are suggesting maintaining the same customs arrangements that the Oslo Agreements stipulate and inviting a third party presence, e.g., the EU, to witness and ensure that due process is followed.</s>
