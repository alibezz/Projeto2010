<s i="0">A lot has changed, and nothing has changed, since the roadmap was introduced five years ago (April 30, 2003).</s> 

<s i="1">The Israeli and Palestinian leaders who accepted this peace plan back then, Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat, are no longer on the scene.</s> <s i="2">Both were strong and willful personalities, but neither one really believed in a genuine Israeli-Palestinian peace, hence they approached the roadmap idea defensively.</s> <s i="3">They have been replaced by Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), both of whom do believe in peace but are probably too weak to do anything about it.</s> <s i="4">Indeed, so weak is Abbas that he has allowed Hamas, which rejects the roadmap, to take over the Gaza Strip.</s>

<s i="5">The order of the roadmap has changed too.</s> <s i="6">Rather than following the logic of the roadmap's sequencing and implementing phase I (confidence-building) prior to phase III (final status negotiations), Israel and Palestine are now committed to implementing I and III simultaneously.</s> <s i="7">Whatever peace or framework agreement emerges from phase III negotiations will now be termed a &quot;shelf agreement&quot; and its realization will be delayed until phase I issues (security, outposts, etc.) are resolved.</s> <s i="8">It is not at all clear that a shelf agreement is a viable concept.</s> <s i="9">In any case, progress to date on both phase I and phase III is unimpressive.</s> 

<s i="10">The regional environment is also different from five years ago.</s> <s i="11">Iran's looming hegemonic aspirations, the American fiasco in Iraq and a dangerous stalemate in Lebanon have combined to drive Israel's main Sunni Arab neighbors seemingly to seek a more active role in advancing Israeli-Palestinian peace and rebuffing Iran.</s> <s i="12">Yet the Saudis, Egyptians and Jordanians are more talk than action: they boost the Arab peace initiative, and the Egyptians and Saudis dialogue with Hamas and the PLO, but thus far with little positive effect.</s> <s i="13">And when Israel contemplates talking to Syria in order to edge it out of the Iranian orbit, they take their distance.</s>

<s i="14">Turning to the United States, after seven years of doing precious little about the conflict and nearly five years of responsibility for a roadmap to nowhere, the Bush administration convened the Annapolis conference five months ago to re-launch that roadmap more energetically.</s> <s i="15">Sadly, what we have seen since in terms of US commitment to generating a credible Israeli-Palestinian peace process is only slightly less pathetic than before Annapolis.</s> <s i="16">To be sure, there are American generals and a British former prime minister &quot;on the ground&quot;, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visits monthly, and President George W. Bush will soon arrive for his second visit.</s> <s i="17">But there is no peace team, there are no heavy pressures and Washington's effort doesn't begin to compensate for the acute political shortcomings in Jerusalem and Ramallah.</s>

<s i="18">Yet how could it?</s> <s i="19">No US administration can handle more than one serious Middle East enterprise at any one time.</s> <s i="20">In the past five years, the Bush administration has prioritized Iraq, Iran and regional democratization over Israeli-Palestinian peace.</s> <s i="21">Even if the administration were not so disastrously inept at dealing with those projects, it still would not have the energies left to make a serious impression on us Israelis and Palestinians beyond the impact of Bush's single solid contribution: making a two-state solution official American policy.</s> <s i="22">Nor did the creation of the Quartet (the US, UN, EU and Russia) to sponsor and oversee the roadmap disguise this basic reality.</s> <s i="23">Any observer with eyes in his or her head knew this from the start of the roadmap and behaved accordingly.</s>

<s i="24">A few days ago, as I was contemplating what to write in this article, a headline in the online Washington Post caught my eye: &quot;Five years, two words, no letup&quot;.</s> <s i="25">Aha, I said to myself, in Washington too they're reassessing the roadmap (which is often spelled road map) five years later.</s> <s i="26">I clicked on the headline, only to discover that the event being commemorated was Bush's notorious &quot;mission accomplished&quot; statement regarding Iraq, made on board an aircraft carrier five years ago.</s>
