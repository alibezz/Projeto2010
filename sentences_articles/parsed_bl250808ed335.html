<s i="0">For the Israeli public, the news of the decision to release 198 Palestinian prisoners sentenced on terrorist charges came as a puzzling surprise.</s> <s i="1">Nobody understands the reason or the rationale for this move.</s> <s i="2">It is of course being presented as a gesture to the Abu Mazen (President Mahmoud Abbas) wing of the Palestinian Authority.</s> 

<s i="3">Here are a few guesses as to the reasons behind the move.</s> <s i="4">If Israel engages in a massive release of hundreds of terrorists within the framework of a deal to get Gilad Shalit back home, this will be registered as a huge Hamas achievement, thus further weakening Abu Mazen--so let's do something in advance to boost his position.</s> <s i="5">That could be counted as a reason, and the conduct of Hamas since the announcement, opposing this move by Israel, suggests that this reading is correct.</s> <s i="6">We can also see the move as a supposedly sophisticated but actually clumsy psychological warfare ploy to stir up public opinion among Palestinians so that internal pressure pushes Hamas to conclude prisoner-exchange negotiations whereby hundreds of Palestinian families can at last rejoice with their released loved ones.</s> 

<s i="7">But all of these considerations cannot change the feeling that this is a misconceived act by the Israeli government.</s> <s i="8">There are the general strategic political reasons against such gestures by Israel and there are reasons of principle as well.</s> <s i="9">This kind of empty gesture suggests that the onus of peace process obligations has shifted.</s> <s i="10">Instead of the Palestinians fulfilling their obligations since the roadmap was launched about five years ago, Israel has once again been maneuvered into the corner of the accused--the partner who hasn't done enough to pump the political fuel of optimism to the peace-line express.</s> 

<s i="11">For their part, the Palestinians have no motivation to hurry.</s> <s i="12">They are content to change their propaganda and adopt a psychological warfare tool of their own.</s> <s i="13">They point to a new horizon: the famous one-state solution.</s> <s i="14">The terrorist arch-enemy applies for citizenship in Israel.</s> <s i="15">Meanwhile, Israel and the international community no longer insist on the demands that were earlier accepted as prerequisites for advancing toward a final settlement.</s> <s i="16">These conditions are familiar: stopping terrorist activity, establishing the rule of law by Palestinians' own law-enforcement organizations, reforming those organizations and so forth.</s> <s i="17">But who remembers those demands?</s> <s i="18">We are all attached to imaginary negotiations for a shelf-agreement that means only one thing: Israeli concessions will be signed as a bill of debt--to be paid if and when.</s> 

<s i="19">This is a deceitful way to bypass an Israeli public that has completely lost faith in the possibility of reaching peace with the Palestinians.</s> <s i="20">Meanwhile, the two sides have been engaged in other kinds of negotiations, for a short-term ceasefire with Hamas and the release of Gilad Shalit.</s> <s i="21">No doubt such political sideshows would play out to the detriment of Palestinian interest in a peaceful final settlement if the de facto political vacuum on both sides did not in any case forestall any likelihood of progress, whether in peace talks or contacts with Hamas.</s>
 
<s i="22">This entire process hurts Israel and erodes its credibility, not only as a political partner but as a democratic state with a judicial system whose judgments must be seen as absolutely credible.</s> <s i="23">Ever since the Oslo accords, Israel has drifted from a firm position that carries weight and credibility to a shaky and undefined position in which its words sometimes don't count at all.</s> <s i="24">This is serious erosion.</s> <s i="25">Israel's strength stems from its ability to stand by its promises and obligations: when it threatens, its threat should be credible; when it makes a commitment, it should be fulfilled without fraud.</s> 

<s i="26">A huge release of prisoners that is not anchored in some kind of settlement undermines all those basics that Israeli sovereignty and national honor rest upon.</s> <s i="27">Most important, deterrence against terrorism is based on a firm concept of the rule of law.</s> <s i="28">It undermines the Israeli legal system if illegal fighters engaged in the murder of civilians are not held to their crimes.</s> <s i="29">It hints to the Arabs and to international as well as Israeli public opinion that we don't take seriously our own rhetoric about terrorism and the war on terrorism.</s> <s i="30">In the end, this process blurs the line between fighters on both sides of the battlefield and civilians.</s> <s i="31">It validates the worst judgments made by war criminals in the wars of the twentieth century: that there are no &quot;innocents&quot;; that the entire enemy camp is engaged and responsible and is therefore a legitimate target.</s>
