<s i="0">The dramatic execution of Saddam Hussein appears to have deepened the regional context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</s> <s i="1">This presents a mixed bag of potential drawbacks as well as benefits for Israel and Palestine.</s>

<s i="2">The angry reaction to the execution among Sunni Arabs clearly exacerbates the Sunni-Shi'ite divide.</s> <s i="3">This is bad news: a weak, divided and strife-torn Arab world is not a healthy place and may be less likely either to oppose Iran resolutely or to make peace with Israel.</s>

<s i="4">The ugly circumstances of Saddam's physical removal from the scene reflect the colossal strategic failure of the American adventure in Iraq, and this too has potentially negative ramifications for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</s> <s i="5">The US removed an evil ruler, mass murderer and serial aggressor of his neighbors without a working strategy for replacing him with something better.</s> <s i="6">As an almost certain consequence, he is being replaced with something worse: a militant, pro-Iranian Shi'ite Islamist regime in Iraq's south and a militant Sunni Islamist presence in the center.</s> <s i="7">Iraq has become yet another fragmenting Arab country in an increasingly powerless Arab Middle East.</s> 

<s i="8">These ominous developments pose very proximate threats to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria.</s> <s i="9">A spillover effect into the Israeli-Palestinian and broader Israel-Arab conflict seems inevitable.</s> <s i="10">In this sense, it is &quot;good&quot; news that Saddam's execution, by an Iraqi Shi'ite-dominated government and in the presence of cat-calling supporters of Iraqi Shi'ite extremist Muktada Sadr, increased Sunni Arab anger at Iran and its satellites and proxies.</s> <s i="11">Iran, Syria, Hizballah, Hamas and the Shi'ites in Iraq currently constitute the principal regional threat to Israel's security.</s> <s i="12">When Fateh supporters in Gaza jeer Hamas by calling its (Sunni) followers &quot;Shi'ites&quot; and when Jordanians express widespread disgust with Iran, this strengthens the possibility for cooperation against Iran and its allies between Israel and the Sunni Arab world.</s>

<s i="13">But this merely underlines the irony of current American efforts in the region to (in US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's words a few days ago) &quot;resist the efforts [of the] extremist forces [who] are attempting to make it impossible to have the kind of Middle East in which Israelis and Palestinians and other people of the Middle East can live in peace and in which democracy can make progress.&quot;</s> <s i="14">It is almost certainly too late for Washington to bring the horses back into the stable.</s>

<s i="15">Surely Saddam's parting words are bad news for Israel.</s> <s i="16">His &quot;long live Palestine&quot; was a statement of Arab devotion to the Palestinian cause that belies all our attempts to isolate the Palestinian issue from other Arab causes and crises.</s> <s i="17">While it in no way confirms the argument of linkage to other Middle East crises that we find so distasteful and illogical, it undeniably does reflect the depth of Arab feeling on the Palestinian issue.</s> <s i="18">This must give pause to Israelis and their supporters.</s>

<s i="19">Finally, Saddam's physical demise represents just punishment for an Arab leader who murdered and suppressed hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds in the most brutal way while the Arab world looked on indifferently.</s> <s i="20">There is an important symbolism here--a positive one from Israel's standpoint.</s> <s i="21">The Kurds are only the second non-Arab people located in the Middle East heartland to achieve political self-determination in the modern era.</s> <s i="22">The first was Israel.</s> 

<s i="23">It is the rejection of the Jewish people's right to self-determination in their historical homeland by so many Arabs and Muslims, including the vast majority of Palestinians, that lies at the heart of the Arab-Israel conflict.</s> <s i="24">Anyone seeking a just solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with a Jewish state and an Arab state side-by-side, has a vested interest in preventing the emergence of a new Saddam in Iraq and in maintaining the degree of autonomy or independence now enjoyed by the Kurds.</s>
