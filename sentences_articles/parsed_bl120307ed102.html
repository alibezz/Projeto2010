<s i="0">Israel is currently having an easy time expanding its settlements and constructing the separation wall that is snaking its way in and around the occupied West Bank.</s> 

<s i="1">Partly this is due to the ongoing internal Palestinian problems that have distracted the focus of Palestinian leaders from their struggle against these colonialist Israeli policies.</s> 

<s i="2">Partly it is due to the absence of any firm international commitment to the principles of international law under which both the wall and Jewish settlements in occupied territory are illegal.</s> 

<s i="3">In the Palestinian perception the separation wall is, at least where it veers into occupied territory, a part of the overall settlement project.</s> <s i="4">If there were no settlements, the wall could have been built on the green line and cause no Palestinian objections.</s> <s i="5">But Israel is building part of the wall inside the occupied territories because of the existence of settlements.</s> <s i="6">Thus, the wall is part of the settlement project.</s>

<s i="7">The ongoing construction of the wall has been aided by the rather weak attitude of the United States and Europe, the only parties with influence on Israel.</s> <s i="8">These parties have singularly failed to impress upon Israel that commitment to international law and the findings of the International Court of Justice are important factors determining the relations of these countries with Israel.</s> <s i="9">This leaves the impression that neither the US nor the EU cares whether Israel abides by international legality.</s>

<s i="10">This is a regrettable repetition of history.</s> <s i="11">In the mid-1990s, Israel's illegal settlement program in occupied territory was the single most damaging blow to the peace process, and the international community's failure to seriously address the settlement issue was a major contributing factor.</s> 

<s i="12">There have been several other negative consequences of the wall.</s> <s i="13">In many areas, the wall has created enclaves that have almost completely curtailed any freedom of movement for Palestinians inside them.</s> <s i="14">Access to health and education services has been sharply reduced, as has the ability of a majority of Palestinians to exercise their right of worship, particularly in Jerusalem.</s> <s i="15">The increased hardship resulting from the wall has also caused more anger and further radicalization among Palestinians.</s>

<s i="16">The repercussions for the economy have been predictably dramatic, exacerbating the general economic deterioration.</s> <s i="17">The most damaging economic consequence is the transformation of the economic boundaries between the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel from a soft into a hard border.</s> <s i="18">Over the last 40 years, the Palestinian economy became completely dependent on Israel, and now, with little to no access to the outside world as a result of Israeli restrictions and the occupation, the economy has no possibility of recovery.</s>

<s i="19">Occupied East Jerusalem, meanwhile, is one of the primary victims of the wall.</s> <s i="20">The wall neither separates Jerusalem from its immediate environs nor East Jerusalem from West Jerusalem but rather separates different neighborhoods of East Jerusalem from each other and most of the city from the West Bank.</s> 

<s i="21">To describe this wall only in security terms as Israel does is so misleading as to be bordering on the absurd.</s> <s i="22">The wall is constricting any political horizon by unilaterally taking land away from Palestinians, thus destroying the possibility that a viable Palestinian state can emerge and devastating any possibility of economic recovery.</s>

<s i="23">The Hamas-led government has shown an impressive commitment to the current ceasefire.</s> <s i="24">With the possible return of international attention to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the resumption of political contacts between the two leaderships, it is time that this wall is tackled head on.</s>

<s i="25">The lead must come from the Palestinian leadership, which should work to persuade the members of the Quartet to take action and pressure Israel to abide by international law, whether as expressed by the International Court of Justice or in UN Security Council resolutions.</s>
