<s i="0">Recent Egyptian efforts, which have intensified during the past few weeks, continue a long-standing Egyptian commitment to the peace process in the Middle East.</s> <s i="1">However, this time they also serve a specific purpose related to the deteriorating Israeli-Palestinian situation, which has been in urgent need of international attention.</s> <s i="2">At a time when the United States, the country leading the international community in sponsoring this peace process, is busy with its own election and involved directly in another bloody conflict in the region, the Egyptian role becomes a necessity.</s> 

<s i="3">The latest meeting of the Quartet took place in May immediately after the disastrous summit between US President George W. Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</s> <s i="4">(That summit included Bush's infamous assurances to Sharon, which were judged by many members of the international community, including most European countries, to contradict international law.) The Quartet meeting produced an action plan which included--among other things--the need for an Egyptian role in mediation between Israel and Palestine.</s> 

<s i="5">The Egyptian efforts simply stem from the different components and obligations that make up the first phase of the roadmap, in addition to other components taken from the Sharon plan of unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip.</s> <s i="6">The Egyptians have divided these obligations into two sets: one for the Palestinians and another for the Israelis.</s> 

<s i="7">From the Palestinians, the Egyptians are requiring an end to all kinds of violence against Israelis and the rehabilitation, empowerment, and consolidation of the security forces.</s> <s i="8">The goals of security force reform are to fulfill the commitment to preventing Palestinian violence against Israelis and to maintain law and order for Palestinians.</s> <s i="9">The Egyptians also require that the Palestinians continue realizing reforms promised earlier, in addition of course to being committed to resuming the peace process and implementing the roadmap.</s>

<s i="10">From the Israeli side, the Egyptians demand that in addition to ending assassinations and other forms of violence, settlement expansion must stop.</s> <s i="11">On the Gaza plan, the Egyptians are clear that they expect full withdrawal, including from borders and crossing points, and desire an international presence instead, in addition to clear and meaningful roadmap implementation steps in the West Bank.</s> 

<s i="12">The first to sound an alarm was Osama el Baz, the political advisor of President Mubarak, who made the point that the plan approved by the Israeli cabinet contradicts to a large extent the Egyptian plan.</s> <s i="13">This leaves clear doubts as to whether Israel has the intention of helping Egypt succeed in these efforts or not.</s> 

<s i="14">The latest negative sign on these questions came in the unnecessary, unprovoked, and ill-timed Israeli assassination of eight Palestinian activists in Nablus.</s> <s i="15">The Egyptians had just begun efforts toward reaching an understanding with Israel and the Palestinian Authority on arrangements to resolve the problem of some of these groups in a way that is compatible with the Egyptian peace efforts.</s>

<s i="16">The Egyptian initiative's chances of success will depend to a large extent on whether or not the Americans back it and the Israelis give it a chance.</s> <s i="17">The Palestinian leadership is positive toward these efforts, but as in the past, its ability to fulfill its share of the roadmap's obligations will depend on whether or not there is reciprocity.</s> <s i="18">Each side must discharge its obligations, because an act like the Nablus assassinations will definitely jeopardize the ability of the Palestinian side to succeed in its efforts.</s>
