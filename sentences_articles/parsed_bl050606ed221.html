<s i="0">The meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on June 4 yet again cast a spotlight on the role of Egypt in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</s>

<s i="1">Egypt's role has always been significant because of its special relations with Israel as the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with the Jewish state, as well as Cairo's special relations with and influence on the Palestinian leadership.</s> 

<s i="2">In addition, Egypt's geographic location on the southern borders of Israel and the Gaza Strip, as well as its historic role in Gaza, give it unique interests.</s>

<s i="3">The recent unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, furthermore, and the consequent drastic Israeli measures of strictly cutting off the Gaza Strip from the West Bank and Israel have left Egypt as the only access for Gazans to the outside world.</s> 

<s i="4">Recent intelligence reports also suggest a possible link between militant organizations in Gaza and terrorist activity in the Sinai desert.</s> <s i="5">All these factors are increasing Egyptian involvement in Gaza.</s> <s i="6">That in turn is alerting Egypt to the strategic dangers of unilateral Israeli policies.</s>

<s i="7">As a result, Egypt seems increasingly keen to deal with both the internal mess on the Palestinian side and the strategic dangers emanating from the Israeli unilateral strategy.</s> <s i="8">Both are seen as hugely damaging to Egyptian interests as they impact negatively on the future of Palestinians and the possibility of peace between Israel and Palestine.</s>

<s i="9">Egyptian influence on both Palestinians and Israeli has, however, been facing some setbacks recently.</s> 

<s i="10">On the Palestinian side, the new Hamas government is less sensitive to the Egyptian role compared to the traditional PLO leadership.</s> 

<s i="11">Israel, meanwhile, after replacing political negotiations with unilateral steps, is much less willing to cooperate and much less receptive to any input from Cairo, input that for a while was second only to Washington's in terms of its weight.</s>

<s i="12">This last summit comes in the context of growing international pressure on the new Israeli government to resume political relations, cooperation and hopefully negotiations with the Palestinian side.</s> 

<s i="13">But it also comes in the context of growing internal tension in Gaza, where Egypt has an &quot;advisory&quot; military and political presence, a presence that on many important occasions has been instrumental in defusing tensions and solving problems.</s> 

<s i="14">The chances of this latest summit being successful in enhancing any future Egyptian role largely depend on whether Israel wants to give Egypt such weight.</s> <s i="15">If Israel insists on proceeding with its unilateral policies and continues to ignore the Palestinian leadership, there is little room for Egypt to exercise influence.</s>
