<s i="0">The government of PM Binyamin Netanyahu has no convincing reason of substance to be upset about the Swedish request that the Council of the European Union endorse a Palestinian state with &quot;East Jerusalem as its capital&quot;.</s> <s i="1">Of course the wording of the resolution could and should be less hostile to Israel, e.g., by explicitly recognizing West Jerusalem as Israel's capital and doing more than merely &quot;taking note&quot; of Netanyahu's settlement freeze.</s> <s i="2">But what can Netanyahu expect?</s> <s i="3">Basically, the proposal reiterates known European and international positions.</s> <s i="4">And Israel's recent behavior in Jerusalem--the disastrous house expulsions in Sheikh Jarrah, excavations at Silwan/City of David and expansion into disputed territory at Gilo--essentially invites a reprimand.</s>

<s i="5">Whether and in what form the EU Council ultimately deals with the Swedish proposal, there is little likelihood of real EU pressure on Israel.</s> <s i="6">The EU has limited clout as a diplomatic player in the Arab-Israel conflict.</s>  <s i="7">Conceivably, that situation may soon change, with the advent of an EU president and foreign minister.</s> <s i="8">But for the moment, we simply don't know to what extent this new system will enable the union of 27 European states to better formulate and implement a foreign policy.</s> <s i="9">Meanwhile, we recall that last July outgoing EU foreign policy coordinator Javier Solana proposed that the United Nations plan unilaterally to create and recognize a Palestinian state--seemingly a much more far-reaching initiative--without generating more than an international yawn.</s>

<s i="10">Sweden's initiative represents the dying gasp of the old EU system under which the rotating state president can take all kinds of bizarre and ultimately pointless diplomatic initiatives.</s> <s i="11">Last January, the Czech Republic held the presidency during Israel's incursion into Gaza: due to inexperience and a heavy pro-Israel tilt it managed to neutralize EU influence almost completely.</s> <s i="12">Then there was French President Nicolas Sarkozy's &quot;Mediterranean Union&quot;.</s> <s i="13">In Sweden's case, a government that has demonstrated a clear pro-Palestinian tilt is trying at the eleventh hour to influence future EU policy with proposals that, however logical, are guaranteed not to find favor in either Jerusalem or Washington.</s>

<s i="14">We have already noted Jerusalem's response.</s> <s i="15">As for Washington, this resolution will certainly not render easier the efforts of Obama administration peace emissary George Mitchell to restart negotiations based on what Netanyahu has--rather than what he has not--done regarding settlements and Jerusalem.</s> <s i="16">The PLO places exaggerated faith in European support and, accordingly, will now stiffen its refusal to negotiate.</s> <s i="17">In this regard, the Swedish initiative represents the near total absence in recent months of close US-EU coordination regarding efforts to resolve the conflict.</s> <s i="18">Remember the Quartet?</s> <s i="19">It represented President George W. Bush's relatively successful effort to maintain such coordination, even as the Bush administration did far too little on the diplomatic front.</s> <s i="20">Now the Obama administration has tried harder diplomatically yet accomplished equally little, and without effective coordination with the Europeans to boot.</s> <s i="21">In this regard President Barack Obama, too, &quot;deserves&quot; this Swedish initiative.</s>

<s i="22">Finally, if Netanyahu takes umbrage at the Swedish attempt to create a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, this cannot but return us to a fundamental dilemma regarding the extent of our prime minister's &quot;conversion&quot; from Greater Land of Israel Revisionist to champion of the two-state solution.</s> 

<s i="23">Surely Netanyahu by now understands that a genuine solution will require the ceding of Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods to a Palestinian state.</s> <s i="24">In this context, he seemingly says and does the right thing--the Bar Ilan speech, removing checkpoints, the settlement freeze, confrontations with the settlers.</s> <s i="25">Yet in parallel he leads us, through innuendo and body language, to understand that all this is being undertaken for very different reasons--to make the Americans happy so they'll keep their eye on the Iranian threat, &quot;prove&quot; the Palestinians don't want peace and keep Labor in the coalition--rather than to extricate Israel from a demographic disaster that threatens its future integrity as a Jewish state.</s> <s i="26">So the settlers get reassurances and concessions and the creeping and utterly counter-productive Judaization of East Jerusalem continues.</s>
