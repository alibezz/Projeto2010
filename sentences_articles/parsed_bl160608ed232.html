<s i="0">Two weeks ago, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) invited Hamas to renew negotiations over a modus vivendi and unity government comprising the two movements.</s> <s i="1">Hamas spokesmen in Gaza were quick to welcome Abbas' statement and Egypt is once again taking the lead to bring Fateh and Hamas representatives together.</s>

<s i="2">Abbas' initiative parallels the current Israeli-Hamas indirect ceasefire talks and should be welcomed.</s> <s i="3">That Jerusalem and Washington have said virtually nothing about it is significant since it runs completely contrary to their declared position.</s>

<s i="4">Under present circumstances, were Hamas and Fateh to agree to reestablish a unity government along guidelines that do not correspond to those of the Quartet (recognition of Israel, abandonment of violence and acceptance of the Oslo accords), this would almost certainly catalyze the suspension of the current American-sponsored Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.</s> <s i="5">Accordingly, one explanation for Abbas' step is that he has concluded there is little chance of a peace breakthrough with Israel and he has to cover his political flanks by talking to Hamas.</s> 

<s i="6">This explanation reflects Palestinian despair with both the Israeli and American positions in negotiations.</s> <s i="7">Yet it doesn't correspond with anything Abbas and chief Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qurei (Aba Ala) have stated recently in public or with the latest Palestinian opinion poll results.</s>

<s i="8">Given the somewhat nebulous nature of Abbas' initiative--it's not clear whether he has withdrawn his own precondition for an agreement with Hamas that essentially reverses its takeover of the Gaza Strip a year ago--a number of alternative explanations appear possible.</s> <s i="9">One is that Abbas is simply trying to &quot;light a fire&quot; under the peace negotiations by suggesting he has alternatives.</s> <s i="10">Another is that he wants to position himself for the advent of an Israel-Hamas ceasefire in and around Gaza.</s> <s i="11">A ceasefire would likely boost Hamas' popularity on the Palestinian street and could be a prelude to more expansive Israel-Hamas contacts over prisoner exchange and the Gaza passages.</s> <s i="12">By offering unity talks with Hamas, Abbas could be ensuring that he and the peace talks won't be overshadowed by a ceasefire.</s> <s i="13">Alternatively, Abbas anticipates an Israeli military offensive into Gaza and wants to ensure that he and the Ramallah-based Palestinian leadership are not castigated by angry 
Palestinians 
and other Arabs as collaborators with Israel.</s>

<s i="14">Indeed, Abbas may have considered all of the above.</s> <s i="15">As long as an agreement with Hamas does not come at the expense of progress in peace talks with Israel--in other words, as long as Abbas doesn't do a deal with Hamas that makes it impossible for Israel to pursue peace talks with him--Abbas appears to have improved his capacity to withstand any anticipated new developments.</s>

<s i="16">This is particularly so given the increasing likelihood that nothing will come of Israel's peace negotiations with Ramallah and that some sort of Israeli decision--either a ceasefire or a major military operation--will be made regarding Gaza.</s> <s i="17">In this sense, Abbas' initiative offers a convenient point of departure for new and long overdue Israeli policy initiatives.</s> 

<s i="18">The Olmert government should modify its conditions for negotiating with Hamas.</s> <s i="19">The Israeli/Quartet conditions never made sense; Hamas' acceptance of the prisoners' document and the Arab peace initiative should be sufficient to qualify it for direct contact with Israel insofar as they offer recognition of Israel and acceptance of past agreements; an end of violence is something to be negotiated--precisely what is happening now regarding a ceasefire.</s> <s i="20">Israel should also encourage the formation of a Palestinian unity government insofar as it is the only conceivable Palestinian institution that could deliver on an agreement with it.</s> <s i="21">And Israel should be prepared to end its economic boycott of Gaza.</s> <s i="22">Like all attempts over the past 41 years to use economic carrots and sticks to influence Palestinian behavior, it hasn't worked, while the depravation and poverty it has engendered in Gaza are not something Israelis can be proud of.</s>

<s i="23">The alternative to these proposed Israeli policy changes is war and/or Palestinian elections in which Hamas wins all.</s> <s i="24">In all honesty and in view of Hamas' extremist Islamist program, we must recognize that all-out war to reoccupy the Gaza Strip and eliminate Hamas may ultimately be our default option.</s> <s i="25">This is particularly the case if and when it becomes clear that Hamas is incapable of modifying its extremist positions regarding Israel.</s>
