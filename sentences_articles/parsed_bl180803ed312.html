<s i="0">Ours is a prolonged conflict, not only with the Palestinian people, but with other parts of the Arab and even Muslim world.</s> <s i="1">Moreover, uniquely in the world, our very long history is a never-ending story of attempts to destroy us as a people.</s> <s i="2">We commemorate the ways in which we fought back and were saved, through holidays like Pesach, Purim, and Hanukkah.</s> <s i="3">We mourn our defeats at Holocaust Memorial Day and Tisha b'Av (why don't we have an Inquisition mourning day?).</s> <s i="4">The Jewish people teaches its children that they are living life at the existential brink, because in historical terms, they are; you can't undo 3,000 years of history.</s> <s i="5">We place great religious and societal emphasis on the sanctity of human life; but all the while there is a huge cloud of history hovering over us.</s>

<s i="6">Now factor in the face-to-face conflict with the Palestinians over the Land of Israel/Palestine.</s> <s i="7">It has lasted several generations, but the last three years have been the worst, due primarily to the suicide bombings, which send a message of sanctifying death, but also because conquest and re-conquest and occupation of
Palestinian towns and villages has to an extent dehumanized us.</s> <s i="8">We have more violent crime, more family and school violence, more brutality in politics.</s> <s i="9">Many of us have also to a large extent become convinced that the long term Palestinian struggle (and that of the Islamic radical movements) is directed not just against occupation but against the Jewish people.</s> <s i="10">Whether this is a correct judgment or not is debatable; given our history, it is understandable.</s>


<s i="11">How do we continue to raise our children as proud and aware Jews, and at the same time isolate and identify the ill effects of conflict and occupation in order to educate against them?</s> <s i="12">How do we teach them to distinguish between the Arab and Islamic threat to Israel on the one hand, and the Palestinian individual with his/her basic human rights on the other?</s> <s i="13">How can Israel Defense Forces tolerance training for troops destined to man roadblocks in the West Bank counter the effects of fear, isolation in enemy territory, and youth and immaturity in Jewish 18-year-olds who are defending their country and people, and produce more considerate soldiers who engage in less gratuitous violence?</s> 

<s i="14">There are other societies, like the United States, which have high levels of violence--rape, murder, drugs, the death penalty--but for reasons very different from ours.</s> <s i="15">Some parts of Arab/Islamic society maintain particularly violent traditions, such as &quot;family honor&quot; killings of young women and vengeance killings, which have nothing to do with our conflict--unless, conceivably, they helped cause it.</s> <s i="16">While all three monotheistic religions harbor in their teachings certain inclinations toward exclusivity and intolerance, Islam currently appears to have fostered the most venal and radical fundamentalist movements, which place not only Israel but increasingly the West in general in an existential defensive mode that does not easily lend itself to tolerance training.</s>

<s i="17">Which comes first: political reconciliation through negotiation, or grassroots reconciliation through education?</s> <s i="18">Ten years of a failed peace process have taught us that the two must go together.</s> <s i="19">But what inspired the Cypriot Turks a few months ago to defy their deadlocked political process and their hawkish leaders and demand to open their green line boundary to mutual visits with the Greek Cypriots?</s> <s i="20">I doubt it was anything special in their education under two generations of Turkish rule.</s> <s i="21">More likely the economic and political incentive of European Union membership played a key role, at least in the timing, rather than Turkish Cypriot educational policies and political leadership.</s>

<s i="22">For political, economic and ideological reasons, Israel has seriously neglected and distorted its entire educational system in recent years.</s> <s i="23">The most obvious result is the disastrously low international testing results that were published recently.</s> <s i="24">I doubt we can have better education for peace and tolerance as long as we don't improve our teaching of mathematics, science and civics.</s> <s i="25">But even if we do, real education for peace can only accompany peace itself, or at least an end of conflict.</s> <s i="26">Peace education, like peace itself, requires a partner.</s> <s i="27">Most Israelis are certain there is no such partner on the other side.</s>

<s i="28">In this regard, if we can't find a partner for peace, then we must consider unilaterally disengaging, including dismantling settlements and building fences on the green line.</s> <s i="29">This may be the only way to save Israel as a democratic Jewish state that can raise generations of its children in something approximating a sane atmosphere.</s>
