<s i="0">It may not, at this early stage, be fair to try to analyze or predict the potential that Tony Blair's appointment as the Quartet's Middle East envoy brings.</s> <s i="1">However there are things to be said about his mission.</s> <s i="2">While Tony Blair might be new in the position, neither the Quartet nor the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is new.</s> 

<s i="3">Regardless of his credentials, Blair is coming to this mission with a problem of credibility stemming from his part in the American-led invasion and occupation of Iraq as well as his generally subservient role to Washington.</s> <s i="4">This is especially problematic since the US is a major component of the Quartet--and the problem.</s> 

<s i="5">The other problem he will have is that he is not from the US, the decisive player in the Quartet.</s> <s i="6">He enjoys the support of the American president, but while the Middle East is geographically far away from the US, politically the Palestinian-Israeli conflict belongs to domestic American concerns.</s> 

<s i="7">Having said that, it needs to be made clear that appointing an envoy totally dedicated to the conflict is a constructive idea.</s> <s i="8">Because the issues are so complicated they need daily follow-up.</s> <s i="9">Attention has to be given to political, economic, security and humanitarian aspects, issues that are always interconnected.</s> <s i="10">It was not by chance or the result of luck that the US succeeded in convening a peace conference in Madrid 16 years ago.</s> <s i="11">It took Secretary of State James Baker and his team eighteen visits in the space of one year to achieve that.</s>

<s i="12">In addition, the history of the conflict has shown us that when the parties are left to their own devices, their relations almost invariably deteriorate.</s> <s i="13">The best example of this is the period since George W. Bush took office and decided to abandon the conflict.</s> <s i="14">The vacuum was filled by Israel's military superiority.</s> <s i="15">Ariel Sharon took America's absence as a signal that he had a free hand.</s> <s i="16">The results can be seen everywhere now, from the humanitarian suffering of Palestinians through the political stalemate to the election victory of Hamas in 2006.</s> <s i="17">Only with international attention and an active third party role do relations move in a positive direction.</s>

<s i="18">The question now is what conditions can help Blair succeed in his mission.</s> <s i="19">Considering that he lacks neither experience nor contacts, success will largely depend on the level of support he receives from the US government, particularly the president.</s> <s i="20">We just saw the secretary of state herself fail to get the necessary support of her own president for suggestions--that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert did not like--to revive the peace process.</s> <s i="21">Her team presented a list of benchmarks that Israel refused, a refusal Washington simply accepted.</s> 

<s i="22">If Washington is ready to change its approach by seriously investing in Blair to bolster his efforts then there is a chance he can succeed.</s> <s i="23">But if Israel is going to continue to be allowed full freedom to accept or reject whatever it wants, we will remain where we are.</s> 

<s i="24">Another condition is the extent to which Blair and the Quartet will be informed by the provisions of international law.</s> <s i="25">So far, the balance of power--the law of the jungle--has been allowed to hold sway.</s> <s i="26">Whether it is United Nations Security Council resolutions or the rulings of the International Court of Justice, neither the US nor Britain has been prepared to hold Israel to account.</s> <s i="27">A clear commitment to international law is necessary for Blair, or any other envoy, to succeed in his mission.</s>
