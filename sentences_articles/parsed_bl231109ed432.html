<s i="0">Palestinian history is at one of its most serious and important junctures.</s> <s i="1">The peace negotiations that commenced with the Oslo accords in 1993 are at an end.</s> <s i="2">Even hardened devotees of the peace process with Israel have now given up and are adopting positions that threaten to disrupt the cozy status quo of the &quot;peace process&quot;.</s> <s i="3">The Palestinian president's announcement that he will not seek re-election, and the recent demand for UN recognition of a Palestine state on the 1967 territories are examples of this trend.</s> <s i="4">It has become impossible for even the most pliant Palestinian leadership to ignore Israel's strategy of &quot;talking and taking&quot;, its relentless colonization of the occupied territories, which doubled after the Oslo agreement and is ever more blatant and aggressive.</s> <s i="5">The Palestinian maneuver, taking advantage of an assumed US frustration with Israeli intransigence on settlement building, is clearly designed to challenge the international community out of its inertia.</s>
       
<s i="6">Whether this will be able to jump-start a process more favorable to the Palestinians is unclear.</s> <s i="7">So far, the signals are mixed.</s> <s i="8">Western leaders have reacted by urging Abbas to stay on and restart negotiations with Israel.</s> <s i="9">The US has even offered him various sweeteners--more weapons for PA security forces, a release of 400 Fateh prisoners, and extending PA security control to Area B and partially to Area C. Israel was said to be considering a ten-month settlement moratorium as another inducement.</s> <s i="10">At the same time, both the US and the EU rejected the Palestinian request for state recognition as &quot;premature&quot;, despite widespread encouragement from journalists, NGOs and activists.</s> <s i="11">Israel declared itself &quot;alarmed&quot;, but its president proposed a Palestinian state with provisional borders.</s> 
       
<s i="12">Perhaps these reactions represent some form of early response to the Palestinian maneuver.</s> <s i="13">At any rate, Abbas is so far sticking to his position, with possibly more positive results to come.</s> <s i="14">But supposing this Palestinian tactic to recommence peace negotiations on a better basis succeeds, what then?</s> <s i="15">And what of the long-term future?</s> <s i="16">In my discussions in Ramallah this week, I have been struck by the variety of opinions and ideas about ways out of the current impasse.</s> <s i="17">Most of these, however, were strategies for interim solutions without a vision about the ultimate aim of a peace settlement.</s> <s i="18">The consensus about the two-state solution, which was nearly universal, has been shaken by the logistical reality of Israeli settlement expansion, but the alternatives have not solidified.</s> <s i="19">The only shared view is that more negotiations with Israel on the current basis are futile.</s> <s i="20">Marwan Barghouti's call from his prison cell on November 19 for popular resistance in the face of peace talks 
he 
describes as &quot;doomed&quot; has found wide resonance.</s>
              
<s i="21">In the current political confusion, people are searching for solutions.</s> <s i="22">The major trends I found can be summarized as: plodding on with the pursuit for a Palestinian state, however elusive, or abandoning the whole idea for something radically different.</s> <s i="23">In between are various ideas for surviving the current impasse and hoping for the best.</s> <s i="24">Foremost in the first camp is the Salam Fayyad government with its two-year program for economic development and state building.</s> <s i="25">The language this government uses of &quot;good governance, accountability and transparency&quot; will be familiar to students of the Oslo years, when preparations for statehood were at their zenith.</s> <s i="26">Undeterred by the manifest failure of that process, the current PA government believes that greater effort in the same direction could yield better results.</s> <s i="27">In other words, diligence has its rewards and, with generous international funding, a sovereign state might emerge.</s> 
              
<s i="28">By contrast, the other camp, consisting of various political analysts, intellectuals and activists, suggests that the PA, which has failed to deliver anything significant in 18 years, should be dissolved.</s> <s i="29">Some, like the politician Ahmad Qatamesh, propose a PA limited to a domestic role, managing civic issues like health and education, while a revitalized and more inclusive PLO would deal with the politics.</s> <s i="30">Others advocate more radical approaches.</s> <s i="31">Without a PA to mediate between Israel and the occupied Palestinians, a campaign of civil resistance against Israeli apartheid should be waged in all the occupied territories.</s> <s i="32">This could in due course lead to the creation of a unitary state in Israel-Palestine.</s> <s i="33">More direct calls for a one-state solution, given the logistical impossibility of two states, are increasingly heard.</s>
