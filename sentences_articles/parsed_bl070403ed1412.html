<s i="0">There is no question that Palestinians and Israel desperately need a meaningful third party intervention strong enough to make visible changes on the ground.</s> <s i="1">The two-state solution is continuously being threatened by Israel's incessant settlement construction and so-called &quot;security fence&quot; designed to imprison the entire Palestinian population.</s> <s i="2">At the same time, violence aimed at Israelis undoubtedly continues to threaten Palestinian realization of freedom and independence.</s> <s i="3">While putting an end to violence against Israeli civilians and securing Palestinian freedom and independence are two different goals, they are so interconnected that the vehicle needed to achieve them is one.</s> <s i="4">Over the last two years, many have called for an &quot;observer mission&quot; or &quot;protection force,&quot; while others have suggested establishing a &quot;protectorate&quot; or &quot;trusteeship&quot;, at times using the terms interchangeably without fully understanding their implications.</s> 

<s i="5">Observers can only do one thing: observe.</s> <s i="6">They do not have the capability to enforce political agreements.</s> <s i="7">Their only task is to report on violations.</s> <s i="8">The Temporary International Presence in Hebron is the perfect example, but clearly not the perfect model.</s> <s i="9">Following the massacre of 29 Palestinians in Hebron, TIPH placed international observers in specified locations in Hebron to monitor events and report back to their member states on incidents that violate the provisions of Palestinian-Israelis agreements.</s> <s i="10">Confidential reports are sent to contributing states--far from the scene--and ultimately enter a black hole, producing nothing.</s> <s i="11">Given the intensity of this conflict and the corresponding lack of trust, monitors will only preserve the status quo rather than change it.</s> 

<s i="12">On the other hand, deployment of armed forces as part of &quot;trusteeship&quot; or &quot;protectorate&quot;, as some have proposed, is a non-starter.</s> <s i="13">These models assume the total collapse of all Palestinian institutions, including the Palestine Liberation Organization.</s> <s i="14">While the mandate may attempt to establish a transitional government and seek to disarm Palestinian armed activists, intervention will not be supported by the masses and many may even resist it.</s> <s i="15">As such, detractors envision Somalia all over again, whereby the perceptions and attitudes of those deployed do not necessarily reflect the concerns of the local population.</s> <s i="16">The consequences were disastrous then and, if applied here, will be equally disastrous.</s> 

<s i="17">If the mandate for intervention is not precise or fails to address the root causes and concerns of both sides, any type of deployment--military or otherwise--will be rendered useless and counterproductive.</s> <s i="18">As such, intervention in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires three important elements: a political initiative backed and supported by continuous international political capital, political will at the local level and a robust monitoring mechanism capable of verifying implementation and resolving disputes in an expeditious manner.</s> <s i="19">At present, it is clear that the first element has been secured, or at least for the time being.</s> <s i="20">With the roadmap's imminent publication, it is hoped that the presence of a strong monitoring mechanism to ensure effective implementation will encourage and foster political will at the local level.</s> 


<s i="21">We have learned that the parties' most persistent quarrels have centered on the failure to abide by past agreements.</s> <s i="22">Indeed, the absence of an international monitoring and implementation mechanism during the Oslo period clearly resulted in disagreements.</s> <s i="23">Such disputes could have been circumvented if an effective implementation and monitoring mechanism had been in place.</s> <s i="24">It has become abundantly clear that both parties will need the engagement of the international community in order to effectively address their concerns.</s> <s i="25">Without a strong enforcement mechanism, the roadmap will soon be rendered irrelevant and the power imbalance that exists will be perpetuated.</s> <s i="26">It is clear that international intervention must ultimately have two main goals: the first is to ensure that Israel has the security it requires and, second, to establish a viable, prosperous Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, including East Jerusalem, living in peace side by side with Israel.</s> 

<s i="27">Palestinians and Israelis alike are particularly worried that if this process stalls or if a minor dispute turns into a major dispute it will result in a terminal blow to the roadmap itself, or any future attempt at resolving the conflict.</s> <s i="28">Palestinians have now gone far in implementing nearly all of the provisions of &quot;phase 1&quot; of the roadmap, even before the document's final issuance.</s> <s i="29">The international community must exert maximum political capital to compel and encourage Israel to begin implementing its obligations, as well.</s> 

<s i="30">The monitoring mechanism that is put in place must be detailed and clear in order to facilitate implementation.</s> <s i="31">Vagueness will only delay it, and if that delay becomes extensive, the roadmap will become irrelevant.</s> <s i="32">Even though the Government of Israel may not currently have the political will to freeze settlement construction, a monitoring mechanism should ensure that the roadmap moves forward.</s> <s i="33">In the end, the rewards of a robust monitoring and enforcement mechanism will hopefully break the cycle of failure and ensure that peace between the Palestinians and Israel is achieved and maintained.</s>
