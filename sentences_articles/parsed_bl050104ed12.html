<s i="0">Over the past three years Israeli intelligence has raised its skills in combating Palestinian terrorism to a high level of success that is already being emulated by American forces in Iraq.</s> <s i="1">In contrast, at the strategic level, Israel's intelligence services have a far more problematic record over the past three years.</s> <s i="2">They have not been particularly successful at such tasks as comprehending Palestinian intentions and the inner workings of Palestinian decision-making, understanding why the peace process failed and violence broke out, and finding ways to alter Palestinian strategy.</s>

<s i="3">Again and again our military and political leaders, smugly certain that they have figured out Palestinian strategy, have misinformed us that &quot;Yasser Arafat is finished&quot; and that we have emerged victorious.</s> <s i="4">Nor did Israel's tactical successes prevent General Security Service (Shabak) head Avi Dichter from announcing recently that the security community had &quot;failed to deliver security&quot; to the public.</s>

<s i="5">Have the Palestinians suffered similar failures of intelligence at the strategic level?</s> <s i="6">From an Israeli standpoint this certainly appears to be the case.</s> <s i="7">This determination is rendered difficult by the fragmentation of Palestinian society and chaotic nature of the Palestinian security community, which point to the likelihood that more than one strategy is being employed (for example, Hamas' strategy that does not aspire to a two state solution, compared to that of Fatah, which ostensibly does).</s> <s i="8">Indeed, some Palestinian analysts believe that Arafat is essentially not capable of strategic thinking at all!</s> <s i="9">At least some Palestinian strategic decisions seem to have been predicated on a misreading of both Israeli society and the international situation, i.e., on intelligence failures that have had tragic consequences for all concerned.</s>

<s i="10">The suicide bombings, for example, did not &quot;break&quot;</s> <s i="11">Israel; instead they produced the security fence, an unexpected and undesirable outcome from the Palestinian point of view.</s> <s i="12">Settlement expansion did not stop despite repeated attacks, and by and large settlers' morale has not been broken.</s> <s i="13">Nor has the violence bent Israel's will: the current government, and any likely successor, will not offer the Palestinians more concessions than those that were already rejected as inadequate at Camp David/Taba.</s> <s i="14">The Karine A affair (smuggling arms from Iran) represents a gigantic miscalculation by Arafat and the Fatah leadership in view of the Israeli and American reaction.</s> <s i="15">And Arafat's ongoing failure to appoint a capable, high-level ambassador in Washington appears to reflect a fundamental misunderstanding at the strategic level of the importance of the American role in our conflict.</s>

<s i="16">One compelling reason for Israel's strategic intelligence failures appears to be a dangerous inclination of intelligence analysts to adjust their assessments to meet the expectations of the political leader.</s> <s i="17">In the case of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who believes that the Palestinians can be subdued militarily and compelled to produce a leadership that accepts his solution and his &quot;map&quot;, Israeli intelligence has at times fallen into line by assessing publicly that this was possible, or was already a fait accompli, even when there was no basis for this determination.</s> <s i="18">Key figures in Israeli intelligence readily connived in contriving to persuade Washington to adopt Sharon's political approach, and in convincing the Israeli public to accept the Bush administration's questionable strategy of improving the atmosphere for Israeli-Palestinian peace by conquering Iraq (the &quot;positive domino theory&quot;).</s> 

<s i="19">But this politicization of intelligence and deviation from healthy intelligence norms is not confined to a right wing prime minister.</s> <s i="20">In retrospect it is now clear that in Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's day, Israeli intelligence at times failed to warn adequately of the ramifications of Arafat's ongoing rejection of Israel as a Jewish state and his support for violence and extremist views, apparently because it sought to provide the prime minister with assessments that supported his peace initiative.</s>

<s i="21">In defense of the Israeli intelligence performance at the strategic level, a number of important points must also be noted.</s> <s i="22">For one, there have been impressive strategic intelligence successes, such as correctly assessing the reticence of Egypt and Jordan to become deeply involved on the Palestinian side of the conflict.</s> <s i="23">Then too, the traditional restrictions against factoring in one's own government's political and strategic initiatives and their ramifications for the reactions of the other side are a particularly strong constraint on intelligence success in the current situation, which mixes a political process with the struggle against terrorism and guerilla warfare.</s> <s i="24">This points to an additional factor: the absence in the Israeli system, despite repeated recommendations of commissions of inquiry, of an echelon that operates between the intelligence establishment and the decision-makers, and that integrates Israeli strategic and operational thinking with the intelligence estimate or estimates and comes up with recommended alternative courses of action for the government to consider.</s>

<s i="25">This is a political rather than an intelligence failure.</s> <s i="26">By the same token, at the end of the day the absence of a realistic strategy for peace, or at least for ending the violence, is most emphatically not the fault of intelligence, but rather of the highest echelon of decision-makers: Sharon and Arafat.</s>
