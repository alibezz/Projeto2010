<s i="0">&quot;Transfer&quot;, proclaim the banners of the opponents of uprooting the settlements in the Gaza Strip and northern Samaria, &quot;will not happen&quot;.</s> <s i="1">And passers-by around the country say to themselves that somewhere in the back of their minds they remember that formula, &quot;transfer will not happen&quot;.</s> <s i="2">Then they recall: the slogan was composed and distributed throughout the country about 20 years ago by the left wing, which took seriously the threats of Rabbi Meir Kahane, leader of the Kach movement, to expel (&quot;transfer&quot;) the Arabs of Israel and the Palestinians in the territories to Arab countries.</s>

<s i="3">The term &quot;transfer&quot; became one of the most repulsive in Israeli political and moral culture.</s> <s i="4">So repulsive that Yossi Sarid, for example, stated that his movement would call upon soldiers to disobey orders to carry out transfer, even if this meant discord within the army.</s> <s i="5">The author Amos Oz said that in the event of transfer, all the bridges leading to the country designated to absorb the transferees should be blown up.</s>

<s i="6">The settlers have clearly not succeeded in generating the same deterrent effect, the same sense of taboo, with regard to the uprooting of Jews as did the left when it was a question of uprooting Arabs.</s> <s i="7">This is undoubtedly because the vast majority of the media and academia opposed the expulsion of Arabs then, and supports the expulsion of Jews now.</s> <s i="8">But there is more.</s> <s i="9">After four years of a cruel terrorist war the Israeli public is very, very tired.</s> <s i="10">It is prepared to pay heavily, to the extent of uprooting thousands of Jews from their homes, in return for the illusion that now it will enjoy a little peace and quiet.</s>

<s i="11">The method that the settlers and their supporters hope to employ in the course of 2005 in order to lift this evil decree is the referendum.</s> <s i="12">They seek to repeat, this time among the entire electorate, the precedent of the vote among Likud members: about half a year ago the settlers turned a deficit of 20 percent in the opinion polls into a victory by more than 20 percent in the actual Likud referendum.</s> <s i="13">Without the Arab vote, they argue, there is no majority favoring uprooting settlements.</s> <s i="14">With hard work, they believe, a referendum can be won.</s>

<s i="15">A week ago, Pinchas Wallerstein, a settler leader, stated that if there is no referendum, the alternative is non-violent civil disobedience, including a readiness to go to jail.</s> <s i="16">The response was overwhelming: spontaneous demonstrations and hundreds of declarations of support by telephone, SMS and email.</s> <s i="17">His fellow members of the Council of Settlers in Judea, Samaria and Gaza (&quot;Yesha Council&quot;), surprised by the extent of support and recognizing that the popular enthusiasm was authentic, hastened to join him.</s>

<s i="18">In the media and the political establishment, on the other hand, the reaction was anger.</s> <s i="19">The attorney general even held a special night-time session with his fellow advocates to consider what legal steps to take against Wallerstein--which in turn only enhanced the latter's prestige among his followers.</s>

<s i="20">To summarize, this will more or less be the settlers' strategy in 2005: massive but not violent resistance to attempts to uproot them, along the Ukrainian model.</s> <s i="21">True, the media, which in Ukraine played a key role in the victory over the government, supports the government in Israel.</s> <s i="22">But as Wallerstein notes, we are used to confronting hostile media.</s>

<s i="23">Yet the most effective means of stopping the uprooting is liable to be one the settler leadership in fact rejects in principle: a refusal on the part of soldiers to obey disengagement orders.</s>

<s i="24">A large percentage of the Israel Defense Force's combat soldiers come from the religious and settler communities.</s> <s i="25">Many of their spiritual teachers, the rabbis, are telling them that an order to uproot Jews is illegal.</s> <s i="26">The soldiers from the development towns, too, are unenthusiastic, to say the least, about participating in disengagement.</s> <s i="27">All these soldiers argue that they volunteered for combat units in order to fight the enemy, not their own people.</s> <s i="28">Together, these two elements constitute some 60 percent of the combat troops and 70 percent of the junior officers.</s>

<s i="29">The army leadership, placed in this dilemma, this week met with the settler leaders and called upon them to take unequivocal action to prevent soldiers from refusing orders.</s> <s i="30">The settlers replied that when more than 5,000 soldiers have already dared to sign petitions declaring they will refuse, and when many more, particularly officers, fear to sign, the problem is no longer that of the settlers, but rather of the government and the army.</s> <s i="31">&quot;This is an edict,&quot; they stated, echoing an old Jewish saying, &quot;that the public cannot sustain&quot;.</s>
