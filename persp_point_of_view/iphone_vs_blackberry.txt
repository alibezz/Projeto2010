iPhone of course. Blackberry is now for the senior businessmen market! The iPhone incarnate the 21st century whereas Blackberry symbolises an outdated technology. The iPhone can reach a very diversified clientele : young, adult, active, rich, less rich population. The Blackberry have always targeted an elite. With the iPhone we are the elite and we can play spies as well as we can listen to cool music.

I've never understood the appeal of the Blackberry in the first place. I'm a Treo 650 user myself, but as for iPhone - it gets my vote over Blackberry. I love the idea of not having to carry 2-3 devices. As it is, I carry a 60 GB iPod AND my phone.

However, my Treo 650 plays music, plays movies, has Bluetooth, runs 3rd party apps, etc.... I love it. I may not switch at all, but if I had to pick Blackberry or iPhone - the chocie is clear.

Honestly, after having used an iPhone I would never go back to a Blackberry. I guess Apple's relationship with Motorola precludes them from advertising that the iPhone is even more slim than a Moto RAZR.

By comparison, toting a Blackberry (despite it's light weight) vs an iPhone is a lot like carrying a transistor radio vs an iPod.

The iPhone is $399 and the Pearl is $199. Not a "huge" difference, but yes, it's more expensive. I should not that I own both. I upgraded from my Pearl to the iPhone shortly after it came out. What's this about the iPhone being a brick? It's 3/4 an inch taller and 1/4 an inch wider. It's just as thin (exactly) and it's slightly heavier which makes it feel more solid and durable.

And sure you can carry around your iPod and your Pearl - I'll carry my iPhone. I mean you're complaining about bulge and you're okay with having 2 devices to do the work of 1?

Yes, the iPhone is limited to 8GB, but if you're so in need of 30GB of music then you might have some issues. I mean I have 5 GB of music on my phone and that's 2.6 days worth of continual playing. I'm sorry AT&T/Cingular sucks in your area - definitely a reason not to get an iPhone, but don't blame the phone for that. I mean Verizon is terrible in my area with AT&T being excellent, so it's all relative.

iphone & blackberry answer to 2 different audiences.
Strictly email & mainly corporate are the Blackberry camp.
iPhone has introduced its "different" features to the corporate world.
Beauty can be in the eye of the beholder.
A virtual keyboard is something to get used to but speed does improve over the short haul.
Blackberry strong in the push email department; iPhone in the Web browser and music experience.
I have had a Treo 650; currently a Blackberry Curve and I am strongly considering the iPhone 2.
Another consideration is that I have a Macmini with OS 10.4.11 which would work seamlessly with the iPhone 2.
The "debate" should not just focus on a feeling keyboard and a virtual keyboard but on how each of the choices best meets your needs and of course wants!

Yes, the iPhone is cool, but "reach(ing) the less rich population" is definitely NOT what Apple is going to do with this product. They never have until recently with the Mac Mini and the iPod Shuffle, but this iPhone is freakin' expensive. It is three times the price of the Blackberry Pearl, which is significantly smaller. I like my music, video and phone, but I don't want to carry a brick around in my pocket when I only need my phone. The Pearl does music and video nicely and fits in my pocket with little bulge (I'm female). If I want some serious tunes or video content, I'll whip out my 30Gb iPod for those times. The iPhone doesn't even give you 30Gb of space, so you'll never be able to carry all your music like a regular iPod, so you'll still need one. But the real iPhone killer is its attachment to Cingular - the number one call dropper network. They're horrible in my area. What good is a phone you can't even use in your house (spotty reception)? I'm a Mac geek through and through, but I'll be passing on the iPhone.

I carry around a Blackberry and an iPod. It's not the iPhone that's going to merge those two together.

One of the very points you mention as regards your Treo, without mention whether you have a Palm or MSMobile version, is running 3rd party apps. The iPhone will only run apps written by Apple and/or directly for Apple. They do not have a system to allow 3rd party apps...

Another point in comparison to your Blackberry (and mine): Imagine yourself away from electricity (in a car, a train or such) and your battery dies out. With your phone, or Blackberry, you can just replace the battery. With your iPhone the battery can not be replaced! With an iPod you can't listen to your tunes when your battery dies until you recharge. Annoying but not a disaster. With an iPhone when the battery dies you can't call for help!

You indicate that Blackberry is 'now' for the senior businessman market? Change "is now" to "used to be" and you're on the right track.

Blackberry had its origins in corporate email, and until the past year or so that has been its mainstay. With the release of the Pearl last year, though, they have entered with phenomenal success into the consumer market. Consider its traits that are not 'your daddy's blackberry':

- One of the lightest smartphones available
- Built-in 1.3MP camera with 5x zoom and flash (not phenomenal, but pretty good)
- Media player for MP3's and video
- Expandable memory via MicroSD card
- Support for popular IM services
- Tons of 3rd party applications, including not just business programs, but games, ringtones, RSS feeds for sports, navigation, etc.
- INEXPENSIVE. Selling for as little as $149 puts it squarely in the price range of the average consumer. They don't have to be "less rich" as you phrase the requirement to buy an iPhone

And this is just the first of the new consumer-focused products from RIM. iPhone looks to be an amazing product, but it is by no means an "of course" option, especially given that we haven't yet seen if it will work well as a phone, ease of use for entering text (more than a few words on a buttonless keyboard can be frustrating), and how long the battery - which is not user-replaceable - will last. And I don't even want to think about what happens the first time you drop the iPhone on it's glass screen...

I hope the iPhone is what it's hyped to be, and not an iPhony. If it's as strong as it appears, it will definitely drive a lot of much needed market competition with its innovations.

I try to compare feature s and not obvious silly things like screen smudge and talk time. I I doo feal the IPhone and Blackberry have a very sexy apealing maybe more iPhone than Blackberry

#1: IPhone and Blackberry 8830 both have multimedia players - Blackberry can view pictures(also set those picture as wallpaper) play music, videos( in mp4 format and also use songs to make ringers. IPhone a can do all of the same things *also both phones have zoom in capabilities for pictures and album artwork view for music*

#2: IPhone and Blackberry 8830 both have email and web capability - difference with iPhone is that the iPhones internet viewer is more advanced and can also be used to view such sites as Youtube. E-mail on the otherhand is more useful with the blackberry and much more in-sync.

#3: IPhone and Blackberry 8830 both have memory!: Difference with Apples massive 4-8 GB's and Blackberrys 32mb; Blackberry has a memory card slot which can allow an infinite amount of memory storage (Current available largest size memory card is 2gb price:39.99). Apple lacks this feature of expandable memory.

#4: IPhone require an apple store technician to remove you iPhone batteries professionally for a nominal fee. Unlike all cellphones available in this day and age Batteries can be replaced by the user without have to not only pay for the battery but also pay for the installation (around $50-$75)

#5: IPhone uses revolutionary touch screen interface that eliminate the use for buttons. After reading a few reviews about the dreaded Touch Screen Keyboard i have realized that it is not as difficult as people make it seem. The IPhone uses a keyboard learning and corrections system that makes typing a breeze. Blackberrys keyboard along with signature "Pearl" buttonallows for very fast navigation as well.

#6: While IPhone is currently only available for cingular at&t Blackberry is available for all major phone carriers ( verizon, sprint, tmobile, not sure if at&t uses them?)

Last but not least with all of these fantastic feature both phones offer price makes and breaks my choice
for $599 iPhone versus $149 Blackberry I make my descision.

If you truly need the features of the blackberry, no fun iphone screens will replace the blackberry. I've had my iphone for less than 24 hrs and here's what the iphone "does not" have in comparison to the blackberry 8800:
1. No voice memo option
2. No voice text option
3. No auto text (I set up in my blackberry that if I type "plmk" it types out "please let me know" and a 100 other auto texts I set up to be fast and efficient
4. No cut and paste (are you kidding me?)
4. No help feature within the phone itself
5. Can't find how to lock it on demand (so I don't push keys in my pocket). It locks itself with a certain minute setting I set but not on demand.
6. No draft option for emails or texts (I was in the middle of a long one, my phone rang, poof, my email was gone when I hung up.
7. No ring profiles (at night I put my bb 8800 in phone only mode for emergiencies and then texts and emails don't ring all night
8. No search feature (for finding emails, texts, calls or subject matters)
9. Capitalization requires two strokes on the keyboard, bb8800 only one (holding down the key)
10. No way to jump to the bottom of a long email or texts or to the bottom of a list of emails or texts
11. Calls - omg, this is the worst. No way to start typing the name of the person I want to call. I have to remember how I organized their name in my almost 700 list of contacts in order to call them.
12. Doesn't sync the tasks from my Outlook
13. No speed dialing
14. No LED light to tell me I have missed a call, have a text, email or alarm. I have to physically pick up the phone to look at it.
15. No way to easily add a phone number contained in the text of an email and add it to address book (in the bb8800 you select the number, menu, add to address book, done!)
16. No cut and paste. Need I say more on this one!
17. No camera settings menu from the camera option, no zoom
18. My 1st calender entry repeated itself for a week (even though I coded it "repeat: none" and blocked out 8 hours for each of those days, even though it was a 1/2 hour appt.)

Fancy webpage graphics and music won't fix all this. I'm lucky enough to work in the corporate world at home and my BB keeps me efficient and mobile.

Wonder what discoveries I'll find in the next 24 hours? Oh, I forgot, I'm bringing it back today. And having to pick up a new SIM card from my Blackberry because the SIM dies when the iphone is activiationd. Wish I read a post like this before I got caught up in the iphone bedazzlement.

The BlackBerry is the best.
The iPhone is basically meant only for Mac users.
Who tells all those guys to carry an iPod[equally crappy] with a BlackBerry Pearl. Did they not know the fact that the pearl has a music player and comes with an expandable memory slot?
Here are the reasons why "I" feel that the BlackBerry is eons ahead of the iPhone:
You have to buy even ringtones from iTunes.
You need iTunes for everything.
No speed dials?
NO expandable memory?
No locking-on-demand?
Expensive.
Not very good, if I am wearing gloves.
Camera has no flash, no video, no zoom, and no self-portrait?
What the hell is going on with people supporting the iPhone?
Also, the BlackBerry is much better when I connect it to Linux.
These are my thoughts, I hope I can get my point across to you.

Not true. Haven't you heard of the Pearl or the Curve?
It has music as well, you easily get a Transcend SDHC card and insert it.
Now you can view movies, watch videos, listen to music on your BlackBerry. There are loads of sites out there dedicated to providing BlackBerry only content.
I am young, a teenager, and I use a Blackberry.
The iPhone symbolises 21st century technology, maybe, but it basically came out after the other smartphones.
The iPhone copied features from other phones. Oops, did I say copy?
I am sorry, the iPhone is a rip-off of the other smartphones, particularly the HTC Touch, but Apple did not include a few needed features in the iPhone.
P.S The iPhone is more expensive than the BlackBerry, check your facts before posting.

I have this debate often as many of my friends are Apple fanboys. I could be called one as well in most cases except the Iphone here is why.

1.) Push Mail. all my email accounts push to my phone. No need to go running back to my desktop. It is fast, very fast. and It not only pushes email but also my contacts, calendars, news, weather, web favorites. No need to cable and sync. I can even get pushed face-book mail

2.) Camera. The camera on my curve is nicer than the one on the iphone. With one very important feature. Flash. Thats right If I need a picture in a server room at night I can take it. I have as many options as the iphone to post and put the pictures anywhere I want and the face-book app works like a charm.

3.) Bluetooth stereo headset. I can use the very nice plantronics 590 headset and it sounds great it is easy to use esp. while riding a bike where I can make all the adjustments on my headset leaving my Blackberry in my case and keeping safe.

4.)GPS. I can use most bluetooth GPS units to work with both my Blackberry maps or Google maps. Or my NAv4all turn by turn. and if I forget my GPS I just like the iphone can use the google maps virtual GPS triangulation option.

5.) Customize. I can customize, Theme, Wallpaper my Blackberry to anything I like. Including setting up separate ringtones for users. Separate chimes for different email and Im accounts. Use any MP3 as a ringtone without paying to make it one.

7.) use any IM's out there including the Blackberry messenger that allows me to link my blackberry to others and IM, Message, Voice note , Pictures and files over edge at a faster than expected speed.

8.)Faster keyboard input. Hands down the best iphone users I have met are still slow when compared to an average typer on a blackberry curve.

9.) user replaceable battery and memory. I have an 8 gig Card in my 8300 so it stores as much as the top iphone but I have the option to switch if I need it.

10.) Over the air updates. No need to connect and sync the OS updates are sent to the phone.

11.) Blackberry has spell check. Iphones do not

12.) I load apps on the blackberry and most will still work even if no form of network is available. This makes things like Ebook readers still useable even if the phone is in flight mode.

13.) Cut and paste. Very important in the work environment.

These are just a few things I can do with my Blackberry that the iphone cannot keep up with. I agree that the iphone visual voicemail and there ability to download music is cool. But at the time the options I have for the blackberry simply outweigh the iphone the number one thing being I get to keep my provider and it is allot cheaper than moving. Plus my blackberry and 8 gig memory together 219.00. Still half that of the 8G Iphone. The new 4.5 update allows video record and the flip player allows album artwork views and downloads make my Blackberry just as usable for video and music. Opera allows full webpages so with a few tweaks there is nothing the Iphone can offer to make me switch. The Blackberry Curve has recieved many great reviews and ranks as one of the best rated smarthpones out there, and I believe that you will find it's user base is far more diverse than the apple group. Oh, and free Pocketmac. just in case you have a mac. How sweet is that

Apple, as they usually do, have overlooked (nay sacrificed) practicality and efficiency for fancy over the top looks and fun. To say that Blackberry is outdated is absurd! The moral of the story is the same here as it always has been with apple... Things look phenomenal, are easy and fun to use, but are practically speaking (i.e. performance, productivity, and things that matter), miles behind. Why didn't apple add third party support? That would have made too much sense. Why do you have to physically log in and click "check email" to get your messages? Why doesn't it sync properly? Don't get me wrong, the phone is beautiful, but why would I choose that over a Blackberry (or a Windows Mobile based smartphone with thousands of third party apps available...many free)? If you look at the things it does well, the iPhone is essentially an iPod that can make phone calls (not as well as the Blackberry), tell you the weather, and surf the web. I use the GPS on my Blackberry with it's 3d moving map and turn-by-turn voice directions almost every day. Unless apple has plans to develop its own GPS platform or allow a third party one to operate on its iPhone, GPS won't be happening any time soon. At least that lost business executive will be able to watch movies, listen to music and check his email every 15 minutes. Apple has created a phone that is, price wise, targeted at an audience that it won't meet the needs of. The fact that its multimedia capabilities are second to none does not mean that it can even be mentioned in the same sentence as the Blackberry when it comes to real world usefulness and productivity.

The Blackberry is Still very much a One Hand Use Object. Not that I suggset making phone calls in the car but often we only have one hand to do simple tasks and I'm a one year user now of the Iphone and I still prefer the Blackberry Pearl over the Iphone. SCrolling through Contact lists is a Pain on the Iphone and scrolling to do simple tasks is a pain as well. Has anyone used the Yahoo OneSearch on the Blackberry Pearl? Simple Amazing.

As a Cell Phone the Blackberry is Far Superior to the Iphone. Ending Contract with Iphone (With No 3g SUpport) at the end of this month. I can even watch TV on my Pearl.

I love Mac's products. My 80 gig iPOD and PowerBook (just got a new one and it's awesome) are among my most used possessions. However, when it comes to the Blackberry/iPhone debate, I am unequivocally a die-hard fan of my Blackberry Curve. First, you still can't beat the full QWERTY keyboard for quick, effortless typing. The trackball navigation is flawless. I do use the Web browsing app and have found Opera's Web app far superior to the one that it comes with. In addition, I use my BB a lot for instant messaging. I bought the BeeJive app and sending/receiving messages with it is so easy, as the full keyboard enables me to type almost as fast as I can on a computer. Finally, other than the phone, I need to have instant email access for work. This is where the BB shines. The email notification system is FAST and I love the ability to receive emails from my work account, as well as multiple personal accounts. While the iPHONE looks nice and does play a decent amount of music, it can't compare in functionality to the BB. If what you need is a good phone and email device, the BB is perfect.

First off, don't say only "REAL" graphic designers use Macs, because that is 100% untrue. I am a 3D Animator and I am using Vista Business 64-bit, 8 gigs of RAM and dual quad-core processors. Also, Pixar AND Dreamworks use Windows based systems. Get your facts straight.

Anyways... RIM has MUCH more knowledge/experience of phones/PDAs on their side. With years of experience. The Blackberry is only for people that truly want a phone that can do almost anything. Not a little new toy. A pretty touch screen is ALL the iPhone has to offer. Just like the PS3, the iPhone will fail. When it comes down to business, the iPhone cannot keep up. Yes, it may be "cool" to take it out and play with and show off, but past that, it offers nothing. I have an 8830, and that will stomp the iPhone in the ground. I can play movies, hold almost unlimited amount of music, email, text, talk on the phone (and much more of course)... Just the Blackberry can do it better and faster. Oh, I can go anywhere in the world and use it too...

While the iPhone may appeal to younger generations and the BB to older, there is no way it is geared towards a less rich population. In fact it's exactly the opposite. It's a gimmick. The initial purchase may be half the price, but when all is said and done you pay at least $200 more for the 3g.

Okay, I'm an O2 customer, having used blackberry for years! Firstly, I don't work for a top tier institution (any more) and I am a die-hard Apple Mac Powerbook user. I use Microsoft Entourage on my MAC (for non-Mac users out there reading this, Entourage is the name that Microsoft gave to their MAC version of Outlook). I'll admit that I'm am a bit of a power user (I do have 3800 contacts, and they are categorised etc), so this argument is particularly relevant to all the power users out there.

I (stupidly) broke out of my O2 blackberry contract in the UK about 5 months ahead of time because I believed the hype of the iPhone. This cost me in the region of £250.

I 'heard' that the iPhone 'does everything that the Blackberry can do, and more'. Right? WRONG! The iPhone does a LOT of stuff that the Blackberry can not do. You can download all sorts of non-telephony related applications like checking how the london underground is running, and getting weather reports, and I mean detailed, private pilot type weather reports - that's TAFs and METARS for the aviation initiated out there!) . And the iPhone does practically none of at least a dozen VERY BASIC things, some of which even a teenager non-corporate-power-user would require their phone to do.

I have had the iPhone for just under 2 weeks, and I want to switch back to my blackberry ASAP!!!! Here are 20 reasons why:-

1) No control of call forwarding on no answer. The options you have are:

a) No forwarding at all, phone just keeps ringing.
b) Calls forward to voicemail after an non-user definable number of rings
c) All calls forwarded on to a specified number without ringing on the iPhone first. i.e. it's an "All calls divert".

i.e. You're not able to set up a divert to another phone number on 'no answer'. You can do this very easily on the blackberry, so that callers trying to reach will come through to the blackberry phone first, then if you don't answer it will then divert to another location, in my case, my PA/office.

2) No cut and paste facility whatsoever, so I can't cut and paste either email or web content into other areas of the iPhone. For instance if I get an email with someone's contact details, I can't cut and paste it in to a contact within the address book. You point blank can't cut and paste from any part of the iphone to any other part of the iphone. Annoying.

3) iPhone only syncs with Calendar and Address book on the MAC. It cannot synchronise with Microsoft Entourage and associate applications directly. The Blackberry can do this (indeed so can the Nokia N95 which I also have), using PocketMac or iSync respectively. There is no synchronisation therefore of Tasks or notes. You apparently have to download http://www.e2sync.com/purchase.html which costs a further $29. No outlay required if you have a blackberry.

4) You can not conduct searches in email by sender, subject or body text.Trust me, if you use email in any great volume, then this is unbelievably annoying.

5) Email is not instantemail, which is why I bought the iPhone in the first place! It is either polled every 15 minutes at the most frequent, or you have to manually update. Blackberry is instantaneous, and it flashes at you when you have a missed call or an email comes in. With the iPhone you have to keep looking at your phone to find out if a text or email has come in, or indeed if you have a missed call!!! Each time you need to do this, you need to unlock the phone, and this takes up battery power, which brings me on to point no. 6.:-

6) The battery life on the iPhone is BAAAD! Not good for heavy users.

7) There's no cut and paste. Really annoying.

8) Can not set up groups of addresses to send messages to multiple people simultaneously as you can on the blackberry.

9) NO CUT AND PASTE!

10) Can not accept invitations sent to your iPhone, even if the calendar meeting request was generated on a MAC. You can do this on the blackberry. It seems that Blackberry's are actually more compatible with Apple applications than the iPhone!

11) Can't set up a calendar item on iPhone's calendar and invite other people to the event. You can do this on the blackberry. This is surely a very very simple feature that should be present.

12) Difficult to search for a contact by company, unless you download Rolodex. Even then, you can't actually search by company, you can only sort by company, and have to flick through the whole list and find it manually. I have 3800 contacts and so if I'm looking for company beginning the with letter S it takes ages for me to get to it. You don't have the alphabetical slider thing that you have in the normal contacts section.

13) There's no Cut and paste facility

14) The iphone takes a considerably longer amount of time to synchronise with my MAC (about 30 minutes), even with no additional itunes purchases to sync onto the phone (i.e. calendar and contact updates only)

15) You can't customise ringing profiles

16) No auto on/off on the iPhone

17) NO CUT AND PASTE. In fact, you don't even have cursors on the iphone, so you can't e.g. place your cursor midway between a word to correct a spelling mistake.

18) The keyboard i.e. typing interface, is immeasurably superior on the blackberry than the iPhone.

19) No autotext

and finally....

20) THERE'S NO CUT AND PASTE!!!

There are so many other little things you can't do on the iPhone which you can do on the blackberry, that in my frustration, I can't think of right now.

Quite simply, if you love the Blackberry, you'll HATE the iPhone (and understandably, vice versa). Yes I'm a crackberry user, and there's nothing I can do to change it. If I need my Apple 'fix' then, I'll just whip out my powerbook and give it a hug.
