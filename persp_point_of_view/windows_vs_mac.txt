"Also,
OS X has actually crashed on me, were as Windows has not."

wow... your writing an article in support of windows and yet you have never even had it crash on you????? either your a "very" lightweight user or.... heavens forbid, your lying!

OS X crashes too, but their screen of death is the rainbow screen of death. I Haven't seen what the Vista BSOD looks like but i'm willing to bet my left kidney that its still there!

"monumental challenge of trying to make its OS work on hundreds if not thousand of possible combinations of hardware"

Linux has dozens of open source distributions and they manage to undertake the same monumental challenge.Its not Microsoft that has it hard, its apple that has it easy only having to develop for their own hardware.

Come on guys, Macs are obviously better. Their sleek design, the VERY easy-to-use computers and software. I have no idea how Windows is winning, but you guys obviously have never used a mac.

1. Macs just work. How much time have you spent troubleshooting your PC? Imagine a computer designed by people who hate to waste time as much as you do. Where all the hardware and software just works, and works well together. Plus, Macs don’t crash (that often). The Mac is designed to let you spend more time doing the things you love, and less time doing the things you hate. Like restarting. Get a Mac and get your life back.

2. You can make amazing stuff.
Every Mac comes with iLife ’06, a suite of software that transforms your photos, music, and video into all kinds of projects. Make high-quality websites, photo books, DVDs, songs, slideshows, music CDs, calendars, cards, prints, podcasts, music videos, documentaries, and more.

3. Design that turns heads.
You won’t want to hide your Mac in a corner of the den. You’ll want it front and center in your life. The Apple style shows in every detail, from its sculpted surfaces to its gorgeous Mac OS X graphics.

4. 114,000 Viruses? Not on a Mac.
Mac OS X was designed with security in mind. Windows just wasn’t built to bear the onslaught of attacks it suffers every day. A Mac offers a built-in firewall, doesn’t advertise its existence on the Net, and isn’t compromised within an hour of being turned on.

5. Next year’s OS today.
Since Mac OS X engineers aren’t busy damming a flood of viruses, they have the time to think up amazing new technology. Like Dashboard widgets, mini-applications offering a world of capabilities just a keystroke away. Or a built-in RSS news reader.

6. The latest Intel chips.
Intel Core Duo processors put you on the cutting edge. In fact, a Mac with an Intel chip is so fast it surprises even longtime Windows pundits, who keep running benchmarks again and again. Results? Fast. Fast. Yup, still fast.

7. Instant video chats.
Setting up a video chat with the people next door — or across the globe — should be as simple as picking up the phone. On a Mac, you just click an icon to have a four-way video chat in a full-screen window with amazing clarity and special effects.

8. More fun with photos.
On a Mac, you don’t need any extra software to make a photo book. You don’t have to leave your photo software to visit a separate website and wait for forms to load. All you need is a camera and a Mac.

9. One-click websites.
How long does it take to post a photo or video to your blog on a PC? On a Mac, you can shoot a picture or a movie with the built-in camera, then post it on the web in a few clicks. Pontificate, preachify, and publish. The hardest part is coming up with something to say.

10. Amazing podcasts.
Want to get your message out to the world? Podcast it. A Mac makes it simple to create professional podcasts, complete with artwork. Add sound effects and jingles, even use the built-in radio engineer to make it perfect. So you can be a talk star in seconds.

11. Rock star tunemaking.
Musicians get all the girls (or guys). And a Mac has the software to turn you into the musician of your dreams. Choose from hundreds of cool riffs and instruments to create your own songs. Get good enough and you could be on iTunes.

12. Hollywood-style movies.
Connect your DV camera and turn your movies into spectaculars. Add graphics, titles, and sound effects in minutes. Then use your Mac to burn a DVD or post to your website.

13. No hunting for drivers.
Just plug in your stuff. A Mac includes USB drivers for mass storage, digital cameras, input devices, iPod, and more. It can see Bluetooth cell phones and headsets, as well as FireWire cameras. No rebooting.

14. Awesome out of the box.
Other computers include software, it’s true. But once you start using that software, you find that you’re hobbled in some way or another. Software included with the Mac, on the other hand, is critically acclaimed as best in class.

You can dual-boot Windows on a Mac (though I don't see why you would). The only reason you think games are better on a PC is because they have better graphics cards. BUT this does NOT prove that Windows (an operating system) is better than Mac OS (an operating system). You are saying that the hardware that has Windows installed on it is better. That's fine.

Mac OS is UNIX-based - thus it NEVER crashes from little registry edits as those in Windows.

You can EASILY get Mac OS and install it on most computer hardware...

95%... Let's give an analogy: 95% of people have Hondas, while 5% have a Mercedes-Benz. So, according to your philosophy, Honda Mercedes???

Just because more people have something or do something does not mean it is better than what people do not have or do.

Also, that 95% is there because people are afraid of change, or have little computer knowledge.

"Forgot to add this in my last argument, but Windows also has games, were as Macs don't have nearly as many. For many people, such as myself, this is a big differentiator for with less games the Macs don't fulfil the needs of certain people."

Off of this...

1) Many game developers create games for Windows, but many also create games for universal platforms, meaning Mac and Windows.

2) You can dual-boot Windows on a computer running Mac OS.

WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED...

"Windows has a larger market share. not twice mac's share, nor 5 times it, but over 10 times the mac market share. "

Market share just means more people have Windows because they are either 1) afraid of change or 2) have no technological knowledge. I assure anyone who uses Windows: Once you get a Mac, you will not go back.

"This fact is what guarantee's customers that they will have and extensive software library to choose from."

No it doesn't... More software does not stem from more usage... Any person who has a Mac (yes the computer, not the OS) will have Mac OS, but she can always dual-boot Windows.

"With the introduction of Windows Vista, the "pretty" look is no longer exclusive to macs. Instant search is available on both, and the list of similarities goes on... "

The "pretty" look is not what makes Mac OS, Mac OS. Vista is just a badly-made copy of Mac OS X 10.4. OOO instant search!!!!!!

"The end result is the fact that most of us will not think "mac or windows" next time we buy a computer, but "vista premium or ultimate?"

how dumb...

"Windows does have its shortcomings, the biggest (arguably) of which is the extensive library of viruses and !#@$ware, no choice involved in this. "

Yep.

Does everyone need a new Lexus, or will a used Honda suffice? (personally, I ride my bike :)

--- If you don't need Mac OS, it doesn't mean it's worse!

The biggest problem I have with Apple is that they seem, in general, to really find their niche in the elite, middle to upper-class sectors of society. Although the cost gap is closing, especially with the switch to Intel architecture, it will be a little while still until Apple becomes more accepted by less priviliged groups.

--- It costs less than an equal (other than the OS) competing computer. And if you can afford it, and you are NOT in the "middle- to upper-class" you should buy one and say you are!

Lastly, if there was something that I could not accomplish on Windows or Linux that I could do on an Apple, then that would be a compelling argument. There are apps on both platforms that are not available on the other platform but as for the OS itself, functionality does not seem to be a critical distinction any longer.

--- Linux is not part of this discussion/debate. And Macs do everything :P

I don't think it's as unstable as it used to be, but that's not my main reason for preferring OS X anyhow. My big issue is security. Not just getting viruses, but having to install and run memory hungry apps to adequately protect myself. Saying you have never had a virus doesn't mean they don't exist and that the issue is a myth.

My family's computer was locked down as well as it could be (firewall, antivirus, antispyware once a week, latest patches) but they were using IE at the time when there was a virus spreading among servers that was able to infect a visiting computer without any indication. We later found out that my mother had gone to a banking web site (yes a real one via her bookmarks) and the band was dealing with cleaning their web servers of this infection, but it was too late.

It's a real issue, whether you've run into it or not.

Here's an example: Jim Allchin told a story at a Vista reviewers conference about Steve Ballmer bringing a friend's computer into the Windows engineering team to rid it of spyware...

"Allchin says Ballmer, the world's 13th wealthiest man with a fortune of about $18 billion, spent almost two days trying to rid the PC of worms, viruses, spyware, malware and severe fragmentation without success. He lumped the thing back to Microsoft's headquarters and turned it over to a team of top engineers, who spent several days on the machine, finding it infected with more than 100 pieces of malware, some of which were nearly impossible to eradicate. Among the problems was a program that automatically disabled any antivirus software. 'This really opened our eyes to what goes on in the real world,' Allchin told the audience. If the man at the top and a team of Microsoft's best engineers faced defeat, what chance do ordinary punters have of keeping their Windows PCs virus-free?"

I don't know about the others, but I don't think Windows should just go away. We're discussing which is better, not which should be the monopoly. I think Vista is a vast improvement and makes for a fairly good OS, but the question here is "Which is better?"

Windows, Linux, Unix, OS X - they're all welcome competitors in the market in my opinion, but that doesn't mean that OS X isn't the best. It is.

Everyone that does not like Windows talks about how unstable it is, how you have to restart from viruses all the time. I want to clear that myth that is rampant. I currently have Windows XP: Professional Edition installed and I haven't had a major virus, malware or spyware attack for around a year. I have only restarted my computer after installations that asked me to. My computer has not crashed yet, though it has frozen a couple times I was able to defrost it.

Mac is a good OS, but when I use it I feel to restricted. Also, OSX has actually crashed on me, were as Windows has not. When people talk about the stability of OSX and Macs, well they should be stable, Apple builds the hardware and the OS to use the hardware. Microsoft has the monumental challenge of trying to make its OS work on hundreds if not thousand of possible combinations of hardware, that takes much more skill.

In the end it comes down to the numbers, Windows owns around 95% of the market and from that perspective, its better than Macs.

The whole windows v. mac debate has become a debate thats not meant to convince anyone or change anyone's opinion, but to simply throw insults at the OS that you do not have, or the one that you are less comfortable with. Therefore I will not try to convert you mac lovers, but simply silence you.

Lets look at the facts:

Windows has a larger market share. not twice mac's share, nor 5 times it, but over 10 times the mac market share. This fact is what guarantee's customers that they will have and extensive software library to choose from.
Windows does have its shortcomings, the biggest (arguably) of which is the extensive library of viruses and !#@$ware, no choice involved in this.

Apples are nice computers with an exceptional interface. Vista will close the gap on the interface some but Apple still has the prettiest, most pleasing interface and most likely will for the next several years.

The biggest problem I have with Apple is that they seem, in general, to really find their niche in the elite, middle to upper-class sectors of society. Although the cost gap is closing, especially with the switch to Intel architecture, it will be a little while still until Apple becomes more accepted by less priviliged groups.

Macs are too pricey for less. I'd settle for a Linux distro any day, but Windows will always win the battle. What, are you Mac peeps too scared to fix a computer or something so you rely on it to never mess up? Something is bound to screw up sometime so I say it's better to get it over with and learn how/why it messes up so you can prevent it from happening again. You'll actually gain some knowledge.

really there is no argument because there is not the same field you compere a french fry and a poteto chip that is mac are whole computers and the windows is just os

if there was a os x vs windows is a argument or linux vs windows

but since os x runs only on mac there is no comperison

if the apple has the guts to release a public edition of osx then we can talkbut for ifans to know when with a friend of mine tried to instal a os x(hacjed) x86 on my pc it was crashing as a wall of matchstics

p.s. i really believein capabilitities of os x but i hate monopoly.... a lot so i love a less monopoly company microsoft because she give me a full media player with out have to pay extra for it.

Windows is a necessary evil. Mac needs Windows and I'll tell you why.

If Windows was to go under tomorrow, then everyone would have to move to Mac or Linux OS's. Well if grandma and grandpa and everyone else is using Mac then it starts to not be as cool. There's nothing to be proud of anymore. Plus if this happened Apple would probably follow the lead of Microsoft and let everyone like Dell and Gateway start making their machine so they could sell more and then they'd slowly start to suck.

I'm jealous of you people with your shiny Macs. No defragging, no 20 "Are you sure? What Folder." dialogs to install a simple program. No viruses. Yeah Windows is so much better. Ha!

The Problem with OSX is that it provides all the bells, whistles, and geegaws at one hell of a price. Apple requires a premium just for putting there name on the product, the customization with windows, is just untouchable. Furthermore from a gaming perspective it has to be handsdown windows, mac doesn't even come close. While it is true more games are being ported to the Mac the number just isn't significant.

Futhermore, Vista is including key features as core to the OS such as RSS feeds. However another key reason as to why i prefer Windows over OSX is the fact that Windows offers Hibernation, it is nice to be able to power down a computer and bring it back up with all the applications running right where you left off.

The key point for me is really the fact that OSX just doesn't have the games to compare with WIndows. OSX is nice, but to me it offers no real advantage over linux, put comes with a massive price sticker. Windows comes with better games, and a three button mouse, the GUI of OSX just isn't enough.


OSX can be oddly unstable, as in the apps can lock up and fail irregularly. A stable build in windows, following windows 2000, just doesn't crash as much. There used to be a time where Windows users would compete in the IRC about longest uptimes. Doesn't happen anymore because the core is more stable. Plus, ctrl+alt+del is usually more than enough to deal with any problem. Macs are often touted as being good for desigeners, producers (ya know the artist-y types). The fact of the matter is that a well optimized windows or linux system (hell yeah!) does just as well if not better ( i know from experience).

Even the "evil" winodows is more open to open source than macs. The .NET framework, the MSDN, and the Visual Studion Express. Windows has more open-source apps on it than Mac.

All this junk about dual booting is irrelevant, you can triboot all three (M$ OSX and Linux) off the same system, (yes you can, it is just harder with OS X) so it doesn't reallly matter, and you can use the native windows boot manager or grub/lilo. There is no real argument here.

The tipping point in the debate of Macs vs. Windows is the fact that Macs just don't have as many professional games available for them. YOu can't just walk into a store grab a game off the shelf and expect it to work on your mac like you can with your PC.
