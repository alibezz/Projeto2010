Opera

Opera is provent to be faster (both at loading the program and webpages), it looks better, has more built-in functions, is safer, and can do most of the things Firefox does. And to make up for the things Opera can't do that Firefox can, Opera does what it does better then Firefox ever could.

Opera is just plain better, and all the Firefox fanboys out there should just admit it.

Having used both browsers extensively, Opera in my eyes is the better browser. It loads faster, generally seems to load pages faster, has a slicker interface by default, has a number of really nice features built in that Firefox doesn't (hover previews of tabs, for example), bittorrent support.... a better download manager. Much prefer the password manager (Wand) as well. Opera also doesn't seem to hog as much memory as Firefox.

The main disadvantage of Opera for me is that the Widgets simply don't match the Extensions in Firefox, but this is the fact that Firefox has a much larger following, not a direct failure of Opera.

There really is no contest here. Firefox doesnt have anywhere near the functionality of Opera, it has so many extra features, and even then you can download more in the form of Opera Widgets.

This is all before you even mention the speed of opera, and the security. Firefox is only a secure browser if you're comparing it against IE. Compared to Opera, Firefox is about as secure as a paper bag.

Firefox really doesn't have many advantages over IE, It really can't compete with Opera.

How does Opera force anything upon you? If a feature is there that you don't want, you don't have to use it. Admittedly Firefox does have a wider range of addons but that doesn't necessarily make it a better browser. Its worth remembering that a lot of users won't want to extend their browser.

Opera certainly doesnt force anything on you. There are quite a few things that you can just switch on anyway. PLus with all its extra features, it uses less resources than firefox, and works just so much faster. Plus its just better looking.

I have always been a huge fan of opera, the speed, functionality, and countless features all make me want to choose it over firefox.

Opera could probably handles those functionalities without the need for extra "extensions".

Besides, there are "widgets" and "Bookmarklets" that can do the same magic.

Just name the "unique" extensions of Firefox that ,you think, hasn't been covered by Opera and see how we can find an equally convenient solution with Opera. :P

There is no denial that Firefox has a much larger active userbase, but it is equally fair to say that Opera is gaining strength. And we are always ready to show our support for Opera :)

This is a tough call. My default browser is Firefox, but "only" because I'm a developer and I use a lot of really cool extensions to help me in my work. So yes, Firefox wins if you look at this issue.

However, I think Opera is the higher quality application. It opens, runs, and renders all kinds of pages faster and it has a small memory footprint. It also has some hefty features built-in. Email, newsgroups, bittorrent.

Take a look at some speeds to see for yourself..

One word: extensions.

Opera can't compete with the hugely active userbase that is constantly providing added functionality through new extensions.

Those "features" are useless to me. Firefox doesn't force anything upon you and allows you to pick and choose what you want through extensions. Often times you even have a choice of extensions that do a certain thing allowing you to pick the one that fits you best. With Opera you're pretty much stuck with what they offer.

I have tried both browsers and find that Firefox is better in terms of community power. For example it terms of ads blocking, Firefox can handle it better because it has a vast team of volunteers who are willing to donate their time to fight new types of ads. This could only have happened if the browser is fully extensible and totally free. Or else people would be too greedy to sell their product as in IE world.

Ironic thing: Opera pioneered tabbed browsing, but Firefox handles large amounts of open tabs much better that Opera does.

I'm using Firefox right now. And I've never even heard of Opera. You know what my vote is...

The total adapability of Firefox means if you need it done, you can do it. Also, the ease of construction of your own add-ons makes it that more adapatable.
