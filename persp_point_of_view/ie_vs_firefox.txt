IE breaks with EVERYTHING. Whenever I'm developing a website, first you write the CSS and JavaScript and everything- and then you spend the next 2 days fixing it so it'll work in IE.

What about those damn activation windows around embedded Flash objects? I want to nunchuck the person who decided to do that.

And don't get me started on ActiveX.

Find function is much better. Ctrl + F puts a little bar below window, instead of the annoying popup in IE. Also, it searches as you type, and the box turns red if no matching word is found.


Another one, you can rearrange buttons on your toolbars. Personally, I move my address bar onto the File, Edit, View bar. This saves a ton of space, so I have more screen real estate.

I wrote an entire article about this at:

firefox is much better.

It remembers passwords with greater gusto.
add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love - tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures,

there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work)

and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks.

much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support MS. Because i don't care about that, a good product is a good product.

Hee hee, read this!

From a report by Microsoft:

A number of security issues have been identified in Microsoft Internet Explorer that could allow an attacker to compromise a Microsoft Windows-based system and then take a variety of actions. For example, an attacker could run programs on your computer when you are viewing a Web page. This vulnerability affects all computers that have Internet Explorer installed. (You do not have to be using Internet Explorer as your Web browser to be affected by this issue.)

Basically, Internet Explorer makes your computer the sux0r simply by being installed!!

"when have you ever paid for MSIE? lol. "
Windows users pay for it with every computer purchase or OS upgrade. There have been anti-trust suits that MS has lost over this issue.

Moreover, there is a subtlety in the argument you were responding to that many could easily miss.
"Firefox is Free" is generally given a different meaning than the weaker claim that "Firefox is free".
The latter is the one to which you have responded. The former, an immense asset to Firefox users, can be investigated here :

Firefox is just so much better compared to Internet Explorer.

First, I think it's important for us to realize that IE is the target of more malware attacks because most people use it. If more people used Firefox, it'd probably be just the opposite. Still, Firefox is the superior browser in my opinion.

Firefox can be customized so many different ways... Don't like the look of Firefox? Get a new theme. Want a music player built-in to Firefox? You've got it. Want to block most ads? Go for it. How customizable is IE? Not much... and IE users have no reason not to switch, either, as Firefox includes a menu for helping such users.

Safer. Faster. Better. Firefox.

I have been using FireFox for a very long time now. My family even ditched IE and started using FireFox.

I don't know how to explain this, but it feels lighter than IE. Plus I feel more secure when accessing my bank account, since IE has an enormous history of security flaws and pot holes.

Even the IE 7's new interface. I still find it confusing. The refresh button is on the right of address bar while everything else (back, forward, home) is on the left. They split some of the menu options to buttons and placed them on the right of the screen while all users are used to seeing the menu (or any option) on the top left. And to access the File menu, you need to press ALT.

Rediscover the web. Get FireFox.

It's all about standards compliance, my friends, about unifying people and enabling them to communicate clearly and efficiently.

IE6 totally is a time waster, trying to repair code for IE6 after making a beautiful site in Firefox is a total bummer! Who knows what IE7 is bringing, maybe better support for standards, but they still try to make their own rules, acting like they rule the tech world and everyone should follow their own greedy standards.

That's why I believe that Open Source is fundamentally 'cleaner' than proprietary. Oh, yes, proprietary is often better organized, better supported, and has a clearer vision of where it wants to go, but is it really BETTER?

Greed as a motive for doing anything is selfish and ultimately suicidal to any undertaking. Unselfish service and not-for-profit motivation will always yield higher results in the long run.

I think you're crying "fad" and "fanboy" without really thinking of what IE does wrong. If you look at it from a user's perspective (someone who's not prone to tech fads) such as an average user. It's a fact that ALL viruses/worms that have infected a machine via a browser, have done it via ActiveX on IE. So why try to manage a browser that Microsoft itself admits is not very good in terms of security, when you can easily switch to something that won't pose such a threat.

Sure, there are fanboys who just hate MS, but that doesn't mean Firefox isn't bringing a lot to the table here. I'd say your zealous hatred of all anti-establishment users is just as misguided and tiresome as the behavior you hate. It's like being mainstream and saying that people who are just against it for the sake of it are lame. Well, so are people who do the opposite for such flimsy reasons.

The fact is that most users are running IE because it's bundled with the OS and non-tech savvy people don't know they can or should try another.

So developers (such as myself) have to be compatible with IE since it's everywhere. However, it's hard to write code because IE always does things differently. There are standards that dictate how pages should be rendered and up to IE 6, MS ignored them and it makes things very hard on developers because IE keeps breaking. So that's why.

Let's drop all the fanboy, anti-Microsoft, anti-fad stuff and stick to some real issues...

1. Standards support: Firefox (like "most" browsers today) has good support for standards. As a developer, this means I can write code and expect it to render properly on any browser I view it with. Then there's IE - the retarded little brother who just won't stop throwing his food. I have to write the code once and test it in all browsers, then go back and add a bunch of hacks so it will render properly in IE.

Microsoft has admitted that IE 6 is crap on supporting CSS, transparent PNGs, and other directives. This makes developers waste time on compatibility that they could spend on making sites cool for all of the users.

2. Security: ALL of the spyware/viruses that get on your machine via your browser, have come through IE. None through any other browser. Why use something that's so dangerous when there are good alternatives that offer more features?

3. Extensions: If you really start to have fun with Firefox, try installing some extensions. They can add a TON of functionality to your online experience, they're free, and there are thousands of them. Most IE add-ons cost money or do nothing short of add a toolbar for search.

None of these things I've mentioned are really debatable. They're facts. So the better question is "Why IE?" Sure, if you need to use ActiveX (a security flawed plug-in system that only runs in IE Windows) then you're stuck with opening IE every now and then. But if you want to look at most sites on the internet, do it with a browser that's feature-rich, safe, and extendable.

While ActiveX can provide wonderful functionality (such as VirtualEarth), it also can open up a world of problems. ActiveX controls are very powerful (actually, they're Windows programs in their own right) and allow a web page complete access to your hard drive. Sad to say, unscrupulous types have taken advantage of the ActiveX control technology to shut down your computer, install viruses and spyware, erase your hard drive, or anything that you yourself could do.

Personally, I'm not willing to accept that risk simply so I can see buildings in 3D. Are you?

The argument that you shouldn't move to Firefox simply because of the hype is short-sighted. If the browser is in fact better, or more preferable, then what other people think shouldn't matter. I checked out Firefox because IE always sucked and was only picked up because Netscape stopped being supported. Plus, there are still more people using IE, so clearly Firefox isn't the trendiest browser out there. The hype regarding a browser has nothing to do with the quality of that browser, in same respect that food at a restaurant tastes the same whether or not your waitress is attractive.

Firefox:

1) is easy to use, with a simple and for the most part consistent interface.

2) is easily and infinitely extendible. Extensions are automatically updated, like the browser itself.

3) is secure, and leaves little trace. Private information can be swept clean using one button.

4) is standards compliant.

5) is open source, and thus benefits from a large, active community of enthusiastic programmers.

IE7:

1) has a UI which makes common functions more difficult to perform.

2) has serious well-documented security flaws.

3) does not protect your privacy. Run Ad-Aware after using either browser for a week, and compare the number of threats you detect.

4) doesn't have extensions and searchable bookmarks.

4) is terrible at rendering text. This is part of the reason many web developers have developed a 10px text fetish.

5) is always one step behind Firefox and Safari, copying many of their key features.

6) breaks standards compliant web pages unless they have workarounds specifically for IE.

7) is maintained by a corporation who's red tape and bloated approach to software have frequently prevented it from rolling out much sought after changes and improvements. IE7 still uses old IE6 code.

8) It takes two reboots to install IE7.

However, IE:

1) has been known to use less RAM. However, taking extensions and other factors into consideration, the difference is often less significant than the hype indicates. In any case, there are plenty of reports of FF2 running much faster than IE7 (http://scobleizer.com/2006/10/21/the-great-firefox-2-vs-ie-7-memory-test/). On my machine, FF2 (with over 20 active extensions) is running at 45,284K while IE is running at 37,896K.

2) does have a decent inbuilt feed reader (like Firefox), but the feed reader extensions available to Firefox (such as Sage) make this a moot point.

3) has native ActiveX support. But this is important why?

Sounds to me like you're just using IE because that's what your computer came with, which is what many people do. That's fine if you want to, but many other people prefer Firefox. Nobody's saying you should be hanging on Jobs' every word or get caught up in "Techno-fads", just that Firefox has some pretty nice features. For example, I can't spell for my life, but with Firefox's built-in spell checker I just type anything and it offers me corrections. I just think Firefox is better, and that's my personal opinion. The great thing about this argument is that both sides are free. You don't need to pay for Firefox or IE.

You can draw a line if you want to , but what are you dividing? The "narrow minded Apple zealots" are using Safari.

I've been using the Mozilla client since it was Mozilla Firebird. Even then, I loved it. Granted, the main reason I used it over IE simply to avoid spyware by not executing malicious ActiveX controls. However, since the dawn of IE7, this issue has faded away (for the time being).

However, the thing that really sold me on Firefox was extensions. There's several extensions (or now referred to as Add-Ons) that I now can't live without. The biggest being Greasemonkey, where I can add custom scripts to any page. I don't want to get into a list of extensions here, as it's not the proper forum, but I just wanted to convey the idea.

As I progressed, I noticed yet another great thing about Firefox, which I should have known from the beginning. It's Open Source. Meaning, I can use it on my XP machine at work, my Linux box at home, my girlfriend can use it on her MacBook and we can all have access to the same amazing features.

I believe that Firefox was intended to reach a much broader user base than IE. Firefox had the ability to reach out to the Tech Guru, but could still be used safely by even the lowliest of computer-illiterates. It has a very large support base, with regular and un-interruptive fixes, all which support safe, fast, efficient and universal browsing.

People don't just switch cause their tech friends tell them to. I've helped several people switch, but they came to me with issues they were having in IE and I mentioned the alternative. When they switched, they noticed a huge improvement. The biggest issue is security, by the way.

IE7 is a huge improvement, but give credit to Firefox for creating enough competition for Microsoft to care again. Also, IE7 still has issues that the people at MS admitted themselves they just couldn't fix in time for the release.

And doing something first, is not the issue. Yes, a lot of people love to wave that flag, but they're wrong and you're right. Opera had tabs far before Firefox, but Firefox was able to bring it into the light.

Finally, if Firefox is an example of people jumping on a bandwagon, then at least it's a choice. IE was the result of a company tying a browser to their OS, violating anti-trust laws and jamming it down the consumer's throat. I prefer a bandwagon to that any day.

I used to hear how Firefox was faster from people when it first came out, but I think they were just looking for a way to justify their choice to people that made sense without having to explain themselves. Fact is, Firefox is slower in almost every way.

I don't use Firefox for speed though. I use it as an alternative for safer browsing with tab support that has amazing and useful extensions. That's all there is to it.

Here are some breakdowns of how browsers compare with one another in terms of speed: http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/browserSpeed.html

First of all, give some GOOD reasons of why IE is better than firefox. Since everyone liked firefox so much, IE7 looks like it does right now; with most of it's ideas off of firefox. I don't see a SINGLE good arguement of support in IE. If one thing, Firefox's history is netscape, which was clearly murdered by IE. After a while a few geeks decided to make something easy to use and customizable which makes one of the first browsers that you can legally edit (an open source software), which makes firefox an original software, not a fad or hype. Most of Firefox's goals were to get to those people who didn't know how to install firefox or at least the people who didn't know what it was and how it compared to IE. That is why we make all this 'hype' of firefox, so you IE people can take a look at the differences for yourself. By the way, the last sentence of your post is not a fact.

Firefox is an open-source web browser compatible with CSS and web standards. It supports Skins, and Extensions and is extremely easy to use. Firefox is coming bundled with Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and is compatible with, Mac OS X, Linux and (obviously) Windows. It is also compatible with FreeBSD, OS/2, Solaris, SkyOS and BeOS .Firefox has an easy development standard (API) for extensions etc. and has a community of millions of users. Firefox supports standards like HTML, XML, XHTML, CSS, ECMAScript (JavaScript), DOM, MathML, DTD, XSLT, XPath, SVG, and PNG images with alpha. It doesn't pass the Acid2 test for web standards but the beta version of Firefox 3 does. The open-source standpoint of Firefox has let to a number of other projects such as browsers like: Flock, IceWeasel and SwiftFox. According to Symantec Firefox leads the market in security systems, beating Opera 9 by a matter of points due to it's inbuilt phishing protection feature.

Firefox takes the best of all previous browsers and sticks it all in one neat package. Security and extendibility are some of its top features. And those times when FF seems to eat up a lot of memory? That's just the cache so you're able to surf the net even faster. Just lower the cache if you don't want to eat so much memory.

IE is in fact mainstream, with more than 85% of online users. Only among the technically literate do better alternatives such as Firefox, Safari and Opera begin to dominate.

From the looks of it, Since the IE group has quit commenting then
i guess that means Firefox is the winner.

So before they close this out let me make my comment.

Fire fox is a great tool, i like the custom look and feel that
you can do and i like the idea that i myself can build my own
tools to add to it and then share those tools if i feel like it.


I unfortunately can not use it at my work as the Seible system
that we use for tech tickets will not work on it. I am however
going to try the IE extension and see if that works. If so then i
will not use IE ever again. As a web developer i don't like doing
double duty and programming and reprogramming everything to cater
to the IE systems. In response to the person that stated "Why
program for IE if you like Firefox" well in todays business world
where IE is the mainstream in every business application you have
to program for IE. That doesn't mean that we cant hate every
single min of the programming. but in order to stay in business
you have to cater to the business market. If that means that you
have to program in an unsecured, glitchy otherwise crappy
browser. then so be it. If and when Firefox becomes the
mainstream then i think this debate should be reopened and we
will see how many of the die-hard IE fans have jumped ship. Until
then i think this debate is closed.

The interface is much simpler, unlike IE7 which turned many people to Firefox.

Security: I don't need to talk much here. Even since I switched to Firefox, I hardly see any need for my antivirus now.

Only few sites are limited to IE, and it's only because they were designed that way. Many big sites have bowed and supported Firefox in the end.

First off, who said anything about Apple, we are debating two web browsers that run on all the major operating systems. Oh wait, IE only runs on windows. Firefox runs on both Windows and OS X as well as Linux. And its open source so you can probably get it to run on just about any OS with a compiler.

Secondly "Original and free minded" ?!?! I have no idea what you mean by that. I would assume that an "original and free-minded" person would use a more radical and unheard of browser like Opera. Instead of IE which is the main-stream browser used by the vast majority of the people on the Internet, not that is a good thing. So sorry to burst your bubble but you are in no way part of a radical group of free minds. On top of that you accuse Firefox users of being part of the mind-washed mainstream, which couldn't be further from the truth.

Then it's about whether users are infected via this exploit.

Ultimately it's about the user's experience when it comes to security, so there can be all these excuses of why IE is less secure (market share and bla bla) but the point is - it's less secure to browse with IE.

"I consider myself original and free minded, thats why I use IE."
Have you noticed that IE had and still has the highest browser market share? Original and free minded my a**.

"I dont buy into fads or hype because all the uber bloggers out there tell me to do so."
Those Ã¼ber bloggers are usually the ones that are right. They compare the browsers. Firefox usually comes out best between IE and Firefox. And some of those bloggers are writers in magazines such as PC World, etc.

"Techno-fad users all need to get a life."
IE users all need to get a virus.

"Im drawing the line, narrow minded apple loving zealots, please join the firefox side."
Apple loving often means Microsoft-hating, but that doesn't mean Firefox has anything to do with Apple. They're pretty independent, except for the fact that Firefox has support for the Mac.

"Also, please constantly remind me about all the security holes in IE, how M$ is evil, and how firefox is so awesome because it did everything first."
You're WRONG. Yes, there are security holes and etc. in IE, and we'll be happy to constantly remind you of them, or Microsoft may or may not. (By the way, thanks for the dollar sign.) Firefox is so awesome because it did everything NEXT - not first. Unless if you consider Firefox to be the first ever browser. Then I'd just consider you an idiot, but that's okay, since you probably were given misinformation. Anyway, Firefox builds upon the faults of Internet Explorer and the Netscape browser. So no, it did not come first, and it's better at that.

"On the other hand, people who are sick of seeing technology being trumped by group online fad mentality, please join me over here on IE."
Do you ever notice that "group online fad mentality" for browsers (if I'm processing your strange wording correctly) usually means it's a good browser. I found Opera better than Firefox at 1.0. At version 2.0, I switched back to Firefox. The moral is, whenever the group online fad stuff people think a browser is not on par with the top-of-the-line, they probably will switch.

Like with IE.

"Nothing gets these techno-fad users more angry than people who dont follow their now mainstream views."

I'm not here to say you're wrong about liking IE7 more than Firefox, that's your prerogative, but I do need to correct you on the factual accuracies of almost everything you've said.

"Only people subject to virus and adware attacks are, well ignorant"

This is a common misconception among those who lack proper education on the matter. The fact is that a decent percentage of viruses can actually happen with "zero" user interaction and without any visits to malicious sites. One virus spread itself through fully patched and protected machines from IIS servers that had not received the latest patches, which is common as IT managers have to ensure a security patch won't cripple their systems before deploying it. So a user isn't making any mistakes, they're being diligent and yet it's possible to get infected. This may be news to you, but it's pretty common knowledge among those of us who make a living handling such things.

Web designers don't complain about developing for IE just for fun. We don't care what browser is best, what we do care about is that we can write "proper" code one time and expect it to work across different browsers. But IE has always lacked support for standards. This means you write code according to the rules and then you have to write hacks to make it work in IE. Yes, IE is used by more people, but if we just wrote for IE then we'd leave out over 30% of users, because as of June 20, 2007 that's how many users do NOT use any form of IE.

Our job is not to design for IE, it's to make sites that work for everyone. Because IE doesn't like to follow or support the "rules" or does so poorly, we have to take extra time to make our work compatible with IE and that's why developers gripe about it. No good developer should be writing code for any single browser. The goal is to make it work on them all and everyone else works to make their browser follow standards. IE does not.

Next, Mozilla is not run by Time Warner. Not sure where you got that, unless maybe you confuse the Mozilla Foundation with the Netscape browser? The Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit organization and Netscape (run by AOL/Time Warner) "uses" the open source code made by Mozilla to run the heart of the Netscape browser. But let's be clear, Mozilla is NOT run or owned by Time Warner or any other corporation.

"MS just crushes competition because it's been around for so long."

Considering that in the last few years IE's market share has dropped from over 90% to under 70, and alternatives continue to gain ground, I'd say that MS "crushing" the competition in this arena may be an innaccurate view point. Also, just because something is popular doesn't mean it's the best in terms of quality. Honda Civics out-sell BMWs and other luxury cards 4 or 5 to 1, but I think if you drive both cars you may find that a Civic is not a higher "quality" car.

I don't care who invented what first and the rest of which browser is better is a matter of preference, but please get your facts straight, otherwise you just come across as ignorant and it makes it hard to take the rest of what you say seriously.

If you lived and worked outside the computer world, you'd know that VERY FEW people actually get crippling viruses. How man people in here that work outside of computer tech know more than 5 people that have had their computer ruined by a virus? Not that many. And even if you get a virus, I'm willing to bet a huge amount of contracted viruses are nothing more than trojans. It takes two minutes to do a scan and find those buggers. No problem. I'm only 21 and I've been using computers since the PC became popular sometime in the late 90's. I've used Mac, Dell and Sony. I've never, ever, ever gotten a virus that wan't fixed after scanning my computer. Honestly, I don't even see why it's such a big deal. There's worse stuff than some nerd hacking your system and stealing you browsing history. Who gives a sh*t? And it's your type of people that hack computers anyway.

Well if "you" have never ever had a virus that wasn't cleanable with a scan, then that must be how the majority of cases turn out, huh? Unfortunately your lack of experience is the issue here. Maybe it's because you're not dealing with real people who have their lives seriously effected by viruses. Instead you make assumptions based on your limited exposure to these situations. Actually working with security means I get a great deal of exposure to those every day people who have a lot of trouble with such things. And the goal is not to steal your browing history, otherwise as you said, no one would care.

The cases I deal with involve bank account numbers, using a zombie computer to download child pornography and thus getting the uknowing user in trouble with law enforcement and the list goes on.

And now you truly show your age and immaturity by making odd personal generalized attacks on "my people" as if there is such a thing. I work as a developer, I know thousands of developers, and zero of them have ever written a virus or anything malicious. In fact, most "hackers" use tools that aren't malicious by nature, but they use them in a malicious fashion. Most of the "hackers" out there are actually not developers at all, nor do they have much understanding of how these tools they use work. Of course you assume otherwise because you're operating on some perception you have in your young mind rather than any real-world experience in the matter.

To answer your final question about why does it matter what virus you use... the reason IE has always had trouble is that it was built around a faulty Windows security model and has a terrible technology at the heart of it (ActiveX). When IE was being created, security wasn't a big enough issue for MS to do proper work on that, nor were there any standards for them to follow. As security became more important and standards more available MS just sat back and did nothing because IE was everywhere via being installed by default in Windows.

After years of virus issues and Firefox filling a huge void for users, MS took notice and started to improve their product. IE7 is not a "bad" browser, it's just still very much behind in terms of security and proper page rendering. I'm sure IE8 will tighten the gap even more, but in the mean-time good browsers like Firefox will flourish.

And to answer your question simply, the "reason" viruses were able to spread with zero user interaction was due to flaws "only" in IIS (MS web servers) and IE w/ActiveX.

I know you think all of this only effects uber nerds because no one "you know" has dealt with anything serious, but I assure you, there are millions of people with stories much worse than what you may be aware of. I've known some both personally and professionally and their stories are nightmares; Identity theft, losing enormous amounts of personal data, and so on.

And your assumption that most infections are trojans, while true, is flawed since you then assume everyone has a dead easy time in removing them. Usually trojans leave doors open for other "hackers" to insert their stuff on your system. By the time you've removed the trojan, there are some really serious things happening that you don't know about and that cannot be removed by any scanning software. Microsoft itself admits to such flaws in Windows, although this isn't the kind of thing people may be aware of in general. There is a well documented story where a friend of Steve Ballmer's had a computer infected with malicious software and Ballmer took it to a Windows engineer to clean it up. After 2 weeks, they could not restore Windows to its previous state and the machine had to be reformated and Windows re-installed. So it is a serious issue, it's not always easy, and you need to learn a great deal more before you start throwing out your childish insults.

because there is too many people who are completely ignorant of the fact that they don't "have" to put up with the rubbish that MS produces, and Fx developers are smart enough to realise that it is better to put in the hard yards to make something work for that poor 80% of people, than just for the truely intelligent people. As for IE devs, they also suffer from the fact they don't realise Fx exists or matters, and therefore miss out on 15-20% of possible users.

I pity those of you on the other side. The annoying load of pop ups and viruses IE has, yet you continue to use it?!

Main reason I love Firefox has to be the tab option. The last time I checked IE requires you to get up a whole new browser in order search two websites at the same time. It's pointlessss. :/

OH AND.

Firefox saves the website(s) you were last at in case of a restart or something. Yeah, I don't know, it just has so many cool features I don't have time to list them all.

Firefox is a beast.It has like so many features that any other browser lacks.It has a wide range of add-ons and all other stuff that will just make people to use it.In firefox we can make bookmarks by just dragging the webpage tab on to the bookmark bar.Firefox also has a wide range of themes which IE does not have.IE just copies everything .The tab feature was also first created by Firefox which was copied by every other browser.And also remember that firefox is a private company where as IE is a product of microsoft.

Your argument is riddled with inaccuracies.

First, what in the hell does Firefox have to do with Apple or Steve Jobs? Maybe you're thinking of Safari, Apple's browser.

Second, Firefox was eventually based off Netscape, which, of course, came out long before IE. So it's great that you consider yourself original, as long as you don't mind contradicting yourself.

Thirdly, Firefox is no more a "fad" than Windows is. It's been around for a long time and is supported and used by far more than just "techies".

Fourthly, in what way has Firefox "trumped technology"? If anything, IE is renowned for "trumping" standards time and time again. Anyone who's ever had to implement the infamous browser hacks when coding webpages can appreciate this.

"Everybody tries to have IE compatible sites" because there are still a lot of people who think they're cool, unique, safer, or normal using IE. Also, IE is the 1st web browser you get on a windows machine (seeing as it comes with the OS). Lazy people may browse the web for weeks before visiting mozilla.org.

And finally, many major sites are discontinuing support for IE. So, not "everyone" is trying to please the 50 y.o. business men who aren't aware that the 72X72px icon shaped like an "e" on their desktop is not the internet.

Both Firefox and Internet Explorer aren't very good in my opinion, but I think that if I had to choose between the two, Firefox would have my vote (I personally like Google Chrome the most). IE is just the worst internet browser in the world. It doesn't even render HTML properly, let alone CSS. It's slow, buggy and has tons of security loopholes. Seriously, if Google and Yahoo were victims of these security problems, then I think it's safe enough to say that you could be a target too. At least Firefox has it's huge-ass library of extensions. You can get just about anything there. However, Firefox is a resource hog as well, so that's something bad. Anyway, IE9 is said to support HTML5, so I'm just hoping everything'll work, or else...

On my left monitor (the one I hardly ever use), I have FireFox always open.

On my right (primary) monitor, I use Maxthon, which uses the IE rendering engine while giving me tabs and mouse gestures and all that good stuff.

I never get spyware (because I know how to protect myself).

I never get popups (because I know how to disable them).

Maxthon opens instantly on my computer, while FireFox takes a sluggish 1-3 seconds.

Web pages load and render faster in IE than they do in FireFox.

80% of the people out there are still using Internet Explorer. Since I'm a professional web designer, I have to code web sites that work in *both* Internet Explorer *and* FireFox. Therefore, it makes sense for me to use the most popular browser so that I can be sure my sites display perfectly for the *majority*.

I'm not an IE user but FFX has a lot of issues

First, it does not start fast when it is loaded from the disk. For my 3 yr old computer, it takes about 10 or more seconds to start it, unlike the browser I use Opera it takes much less time to start.

Plug-ins i frequently use such as Adobe Flash Player does not perfrom well in FFX. The flash movie often stops in FX unlike in Opera which plays flash movies smoothly.

Lastly, Firefox is still young. I guess it is much better than IE. But for me Opera is still the best.

Firefox is a fad and I wonder if any of you people here that advocate for Firefox have used IE 7. I used to be a Firefox fan but I now use Opera, which is a much better browser than either of the ones being argued about here. On the whole though, the only thing Firefox really has going for it is the extensions capability.

Also Firefox doesn't even do tabs right, its interface is SDI-which are not true tabs-rather than how Opera does it which is MDI-which is how tabs are meant to be. Many things that Firefox users tout was done by Firefox first is simply not true, many of the features were taken from Opera or other applications.

In the end, Firefox is an example of how if enough 'tech' people convince their none 'tech' friends that Firefox is better, that people will start to jump on the bandwagon.

I switched from IE 5 / 6 to Firefox a while back for one thing alone, tabs.

My experience with Firefox was not without problems ... these included:

Interoperability - my bank does not support Firefox, nor do several other services I use.

Memory Issues - Firefox uses approximately 25% more RAM than IE for a similar number of open windows or tabs (in my case, I float around 7 at any one time).

Start Times - Firefox is sluggish to load compared to IE on the same machine ... a minor thing, but a little irritant each time I use it.

Still, for all those, I stayed with Firefox for many moons because I LOVE tabbed browsing.

Now along comes IE 7 with delicious tabbed browsing and none of the problems listed above.

To me, the experience of using the software is far more important than any misguided notion I might have about Fighting the Man by not using Microsoft Software. I want software that works reliably and lets me do what I want to do. My zero dollars is totally on IE7 for that now (although I do appreciate the help that Firefox gave IE in getting to tabbed browsing).

IE7 is obviously the better choice. Firefox claims that it is more secure, but the only people that are subject to virus and adware attacks are, well, ignorant. And all the web designers complaining about coding for IE, shut up. It's by far the more popular browser - 4 out of 5 of you are on it right now. Why would you code for a minority of programs in the first place? It's business ethics - you shouldn't care which browser is "better." The vast majority of people use IE, not Firefox. In a nutshell, your job is to design for IE anyway. What kind of fool would write code for anything but IE? A broke one, I suppose. Firefox is better for n00bs. I'll give it that. But if you know what you're doing on a computer, if you know how to protect yourself no matter, if you know what the outside of your mother's basement looks like, you should be using IE7. As far as password memorization goes, there is something called Windows Live Toolbar. It remembers everything for FormFill: names, address, credit card numbers, etc. When you enter info such as credit card numbers, you're prompted for a password. I could go on and on about how much better IE7 is... Who cares who invented tabbed browsing first. How much longer has MS been making browsers than Mozilla? Mozilla is run by TimeWarner - like that's any less $-oreinted than MS. MS just crushes competition because it's been around for so long. How many of you are on a PC right now?? How many of you are NOT running Windows?? Nuff said.
