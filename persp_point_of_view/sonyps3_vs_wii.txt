This is almost comparing apples to oranges. Both are intriguing "next"-generation systems (whatever that's supposed to mean, haha) and have their relative pros and cons. But when it comes to straight up processing and gaming power, the PS3 blows the Wii out of the water. I was playing Madden '07 on the Wii the other day and thought for a second that I was playing Madden '01 on the N64. Yes, you can twirl the Wii's "nunchuck" around in the air and play jump rope with it if you want, but once that gets old, where does the Wii go from there?

When you buy a Wii, Nintendo is making money. When you buy a PS3, Sony is losing hundreds of dollars. It may not have quite the innitial "Wiz Bang" thrill of Wiiiiii, but it is a /very/ nicely made computer system that you can buy for littlerly hundreds of dollars less than it costs to manufacture.

Wait on the Wii, volume sales will drop its price sooner than Sony will be able to afford losing even more money on each PS3.

ummm... Who goes home at night and plays their wii? Maybe I should rephrase that, who goes home and acts like a monkey in front of their TV? Let me lay this out in the simplest terms possible:

3.2ghz 8 core cpu
700mhz nvidia gpu
1080p hd graphics
bluray
wifi, bluetooth, gigabit, 60gb hd

Sure, wii is riding the fad wave high right now, but what happens 6 months from now when the buzz is gone and all your left with is a toy?

the SIXAXIS is motion sensitive. Oh oops, did PS3 just match wii's claim to fame. In fact, it looks like sony, as usual, took it to the next level and made the name of their controller a palindrome.

The future of television is HD, is it not? If this is the case, then why does the Wii not support HDTV?

The Wii is equivalent to that WalMart add-on you can buy for Tiger Woods that lets you swing a tiny plastic golf club in real life to hit the ball in the television. If WalMart, or TyCo, or whoever makes it can do it, then it obviously it isn't that impressive. This argument is futile anyways since XBox360 is the best next gen console out there.

Just wait until October 16th. Grand Theft Auto IV hits the Box and PS3 and all you little Wii boys will be left crying with your sad little cartoon characters playing Wii tennis or shooting balloons.

Wow. Have fun with that.

the Wii is not an original concept! i believe there was an arcade game about ohhhh maybe 10 years ago that the Wii stole their entire concept from. I don't remember what its called, but you picked up the gloves and put them on your hands and then had to box the air to hit your opponent. sound familiar? sorry boys, the Wii, if anything, is an old school idea in a shiny box. it will fail just like the arcade games of yesteryear.

Even though the Wii will likely outsell the PS3, the PS3 is clearly the better platform over the long run for the following reasons:

1- HD is here, and it is awesome!
2- When developers figure out the Cell processor, there will be some amazing games that cannot be matched by the Wii.
3- The Blu-Ray drive, expandable HDD, and online services position the PS3 to be an entertainment powerhouse.

IMHO, in the long run PS3 will be the better platform. Sony
released the PS3 way too early, mainly because they were forced
to by the xBox 360, Wii and competting HD Media "HD-DVD".

If Sony would have held off on the release till say November of
2007, Game Developers would have more titles and production would
have matched demand.

Just bad planning on Sony's part.

My money is on the PS3 a year from now.

Just because Nintendo mass produces DS and Wii to appeal to the youngin's and happens to sell successfully well by undercutting the cutting-edge technology in the TRUE next-gen consoles. Wii and DS will sell sky high but that doesn't mean they're worth a sh*t in the end. People want an immersing, addicting game and they'll find it on the PS3 or XBOX360. Nintendo just needs to come out a game based on using the controllers as sex toys

People labeling the PS3 as a failure this early are either
1- Fanboys of another platform
2-suffering from extremely short term memory (remember the ps2?)
3- stupid

The playstation3's hardware has been stressed enough already, all I want to say is that the ps3 is waiting for a killer game to come out, Metal Gear Solid 4 : Sons of Patriots / Grand Theft Auto IV are a couple that come to mind.

the ps3 certainly did have a rocky start to its sales, but to throw Sony's size, influence and market share out the window this early is shortsighted

It's funny that you brought up the iPod. It was and still is riding a fad wave. The Sony Walkman is still one of the best names in portable audio in terms of sound quality and battery life, but people no longer recgonize it as much because of Apples marketing campaign (the main reason it is doing so well). Sony is dedicated to making a superior/unique product and not just riding along with the current fad. Sony always makes unique products and trys not do what everyone else is doing just like what it has done with the Playstation 3. Nitendo has always made products aimed towards a younger target audience, but many gamers have grown up and need a more serious gaming console. The Wii is currently selling more but soon enough it will become bland and boring and the Playstation 3 will still be viewed as unique.

i think that overtime the Wii's gameplay is going to get stale. there are only so many possible motions that can be incorporated into gameplay. look at Wii sports, for example. how many actual different motions do you actually have to execute to play the game? the possibilities are limited.

now, you might rebuttal by saying that playing with a regular, traditional controller is even more mundane, but this is where the differentiation occurs. the emphasis on the Wii is what YOU as a gamer has to do to make your character perfrom. Whereas in traditional, standard controller systems, the emphasis is on what THE CHARACTER does as a result of your input.

lets look at Assassin's Creed to illustrate this. the new control scheme for Assassin's Creed has the four controller buttons each mapped to a different part of the body. triangle for the head, square and circle for each arm, respectively, and X for the lower body. this control scheme, combined with the power of the PS3 will allow for over 10,000 possible character animations. Prince of Persia, arguably one of the best animated games of all time, only had 500 animations. This results in an incredible depth of gameplay and an incredibly lengthly quest to discover all of the possibilities of the game.

and how is this possible? it's possible due to the awesome power of the PS3.

i'm not so sure one of the largest electronics company in the world is going to go bankrupt anytime soon. i also don't think that you can call future predictions factual statements. i also think that you, along with the other Wii posters have forgotten that the PS3 controller is motion sensitive as well. furthermore, i'm not so sure that the price of a dual core processor at only $800 is going to hinder a development company that much, particularly the major ones. and still further, i'm not so sure why lowering prices to increase sales is a sign of failure. i'm pretty sure almost every business does that at some point, and in fact, it's a natural process of economics. it's called market saturation. still continuing on, i don't know how many global companies you have been the CEO of, but i think its perfectly fine for Sony to celebrate the success of the PS2, after all, it did put all other systems to shame at the time. shall we keep this going? yes? lets. i'm pretty sure when you can map each appendage of your character's body to the controller and then use that to make over 10,000 different character animations, that
might possibly be considered intuitive. exactly how many
animations are there in Wii tennis? maybe 20? forehand, backhand, overhand, lob, a handful more? as for backwards compatibility, i wouldn't exactly say that the Wii has the market cornered on that one. who really wants to play a gamecube game anyways? that was
such a successful system... 21 million worldwide as of 2006, compared to the over 115 million PS2's sold in the same time period.

in conclusion, i just went through your entire argument and, though not making a strong argument for the PS3, because i don't really care about that, i did manage to make you look like a sad little high school debater. good night.

i also want to know... are you saying the Wii has maxed out its potential at launch? because if you are saying that the PS3 won't get there for some time, i would only be lead to assume that that means the Wii is already there, which in that case, doesn't lead to much promise for the future of the system. did PS2 games not get better and more complex as time went on? Are Xbob360 games not constantly improving? whats so bad about having to wait a little while for a truly amazing game? i think it would be better to wait then to not even play at all because you are a stubborn fan boy. but thats just my opinion.

also, i don't know if Wii players maybe just weren't good at other games, and the simple swatting motion is easy for them to master or something, but last time i checked, playing regular controller based games wasn't ever not fun (please read that statement intelligently, i know its a little complicated for some of you folks out there in Wii sports land).

number one. you tried to make an intelligent argument and then said "pwned." you are a loser.

number two. i think there was already a technology out there that you could point at the screen and it new where the controller was. what was that called? oh yeah, the light gun for f**king duck hunt. c'mon guys. you talk like the Wii is this brand new concept, when really, its just a shiny new take on a lot of really old technology.

go find a ten year projection for the three "next-gen" (i use quotes because the Wii is hardly next-gen) consoles. in ten years the PS3 is ahead of the Wii by about 40%. it's not a fact, it's only a hypothesis, i know. but it's based on the fact that the Wii is prematurely ejaculating. it's using old technology to sell cheap, where as the PS3 is selling new tech, yes, that is expensive, but when it becomes more standard its going to get cheaper, and guess what? when that happens it will be over for the Wii.

i just hope the other guys don't cop-out and start using motion sensing. i will have to become a PC gamer then to avoid that lameness.

Find a preview of LittleBigPlanet, and then come and tell me the Wii has half, just half, the capabilities to run a game like that. I'll even allow you to try and argue that with one player on the screen the Wii might make a laughable effort at having graphics and physics that good. But then I will simply point out the Sony is running that with 4 players on the screen at the same time, online.

Wow, the Wii has a web browser, my computer had that in like 96.

When did TV remotes come out? In like the 70s? Now the Wii decides to use one and call it new? Right...

You all hate on Sony. What other company has sold 100 million systems? They will do it again. It's going to be a slow burn, but the PS3 is going to bring the house down.

the Ps3 also has a web browser. Also, the Wii has no game selection whatsoever. The games are all targeted towards 8-12 year old kids and the gameplay is stale. I was a HUGE Nintendo 64 fan but after a while, Mario Does the Shopping and other unorginonal series get boring. I was dissappointed with the gamecube and even more with the Wii. As soon as the Ps3 gets a good game and as soon as they find a cheaper way to manufacture the system, it will far surpass the Wii. And for crying out loud, the motion sensor idea was used 10 years ago by a certain arcade game. Im not sure if anyone here remembers it.

The Wii controllers die or lose their motion sensing resolution after a couple months of use. Probably because of the massive G-force exerted on the internals when playing some of games.

There's a Wii sitting in my front room now not being used because multiplayer games are unfair for one of the players - and who wants to play the Wii on their own? Part (most) of the fun is playing with someone else.

At thirty pound a pop for the controllers, and at least the same price as the games, this machine is soon going to rack up one hell of a bill by the time it's part exchanged for a PS3. In fact, its AV input to the TV has been swapped for a PS2! It won't be long before that input has been swapped to that of the PS3.

If you're going to try something "new", like Nintendo, it's probably a good idea to ensure that the encouraged use does not lead to the destruction of the hardware. That said, it does add to the profitability of the machine - but if that's their game, i'll vote PS3.

In terms of proper, serious gaming, the ps3 is better - graphics, storyline, hardware... it's all a gamer's dream.

However for a child, or a family, or a casual gamer, the wii is actually pretty cool. It's as though you have an arcade in your living room.

I compare this battle to what has happened recently with the DS vs PSP. When the PSP came out it was technology better in EVERY aspect much like how the PS3 is. The DS on the other hand offered something new to gamers the dual touch screen display similar to what Wii is doing with the new controls. I was a major fan of the PSP when it came out however due to its high cost and lack of support, it pretty much became a nice little paper weight on my desk. I see the PS3 on the same path as the PSP, technology its superior, but where are the fun and unique games?

The point is it doesn't get old; It is not just a novely, like some had feared; it's a whole new way of playing, and it is BETTER. It would be great if the Wii had amazing graphics, but graphics really aren't that important. If I just wanted to look at something pretty I'd watch a film instead of playing a game.

"When it comes to straight up processing and gaming power" the PS3 is obviously much better, but so what?

The fact is the Wii gives you a whole new (and in fact completely natural feeling) experience, it actually lets you get into the game; it has better games; it has access to Nintendo and Sega's range of classic games; oh, and you can afford it without having to re-mortgage the house.

Wii is a revolutionary system. Nintendo has always been the company to come out with something new; usually ahead of time with their new product. This time, it has actually turned out pretty damn good, rather than the horrible turn out of the Power Glove which was a good idea, but couldn't be properly made because the censors couldn't direct the character in the right direction two thirds of the time.

Anyways, to get to the point, sure, the PS3 has great graphics but when it all comes down to it, aren;t video games meant to be fun, rather than good to look at? If you want something good to look at, go look at porn or some shiny object; not some really good looking video game. Wii = better. Deal with it.

Ya, i don't know how you can try to even compare these too systems tho. They are completely different from one another, but when it comes down to graphics, and stuff, sure it looks good, but just think about what can be done on the wii in terms of other things besides gaming. It is an intuative, and fun system for the whole family, and that is what will make it sell because more people can get involved. The Ps3 has the older audience with games like Resistance, and that is fine. But that is why they are losing the battle. Different audiences, mean different design, gameplay, and ideas.

All I hear from the opposing side is babble about the superiority of the PS3's processing, graphics, and other unimportant computer hogwash. Not one has struck out against the Wii itself.

My first point: When playing a game, you do it for one thing: Entertainment. Thus I believe it nescessary for everyone to frame their decision in regards to which system provides the best entertainment.

Second: The Wii fits this bill perfectly. There are countless sub points to this, including interactivity, originality, playability, and family avaliability.

Third: The Wii is superior in that it is playable by everyone. It is much easier to pick up a Wii and enjoy the packaged "Sports" with your elderly mother than attempt to teach her how to play Fall of Man.

Fourth: Graphics are unimportant. If you cannot be entertained unless everything is picture perfect, you should not be playing a video game.

Fifth: I can take my Wii over to my friends house, because it is so small. The PS3 is nearly impossible to lug around, while my tiny Wii can be maneuvered easily.

Sixth: Any video game system that can make me like Dragon Ball Z automatically wins this debate.

Seventh: Need I go in detail on the price issue?

Eighth: Need I go in detail on the ability to make jokes about "My Wii"?

Ninth: To all the PS3 owners out there, try to play your PSX and PS2 games on your new system. Just try it and see what happens. See if you come back bragging about the graphics after that little test.

That should be enough for now.

The controller is not motion sensitive, it's tilt sensitive along SIX AXIS'. The range of control with the Wii's controller is by far larger than what you can achieve with the PS3's controller.

Funny, wasn't Sony and their fanboys saying that about the DS some years ago? What happened with that argument? Oh, that's right, it ended up not coming true! The DS introduced a radically new way to play and control your games, just like the Wii. Here we are, +2 years after the DS' launch, and almost 2 years after the PSP's launch. PSP sales JUST recently broke 20 million units sold (or is that shipped?), and the DS just passed 35 million systems sold (I can say sold, because that's what Nintendo reports). PS3 just recently passed 1 million systems sold, while the Wii is well past 4 million. Note that the numbers I've provided are world wide sales totals.

Sorry, but the PS3 is just an expensive Blu-ray player that happens to play video games. The Wii is where all the fun is at.

Not everone is interested in "Shooting up the joint" or any violence

Some people want to have a thing called FUN
heard of it? Obviously not...

I agree with the 360 owning, but at the end of the day the PS3 is a useless overpriced box, all it gives you is good graphics, without the element of being "in" the game!

Some people dont need HDTV to enjoy a game, they need good gameplay which is what the WIi delivers

The Wii's possibilities are endless, The wii remote has a number of uses now, and all it takes is a good idea in the futre to expand on the wii remotes use..

Processing power? Its not needed, you dont need a tennis racket with exactly 48 crosses, or a tennis ball with exactly 2,417 fibres, You need a racket a ball and being able to swing it

Not X,Triangle, X,X... Button bashing..

Its not even a competition.. Wiimotes are wireless AND sensored. Comon! and there are games for all ages.. theres zelda and Call Of Duty for the teens and adults. Mario games for children, and so on.

PS3 = Hardware which won't be pushed to it's full potential for quite awhile and a big price tag.

Wii = Fun.

That's it.

PS3 is definitely losing the battle, the prices are too high and not many people are buying it. Now look at Wii, cheap, affordable, has a new way of playing games, it has a web browser, weather, etc

And PS3 is so huge, I wouldn't buy that thing

The Wii Vs. the Ps3? No contest. For those of you who haven't been to a Walmart lately, have you noticed how the Ps3 is sitting a shelf. For those of you who haven't been to a Gamestop, EB Games, Best Buy, Walmart, or basicly any other game retailer in the US, have you noticed that you can't find a single Wii after noon? That's because they're selling like crazy. And there's two reasons for this: Fun and price. Emphasis on fun. There are many reasons that the Ps3 isn't selling. First of all, it's WAY too expensive. I'm sorry, but they're going way out of their league in technology, which has put them off to an absolutely horrible start. As of this moment they are being laughed at by every other game company out there. If Sony doesn't change some things (Price, mostly.) third party support is going to leave them for game systems that are selling better (The Wii and the XBox 360.) The Ps3 is, in theory, a GREAT gaming system. 480dpi HD, 8 core processors. It all seems so enticing, but what's it worth? They won't have games like that for at least another 2 years. A DUALCORE processor for a PC at the moment of the same level costs around 800 dollars. So where is Sony's money going? That's right - Down the drain. They're either going to go bankrupt or quit selling Ps3's because they are horribly expensive. I'm not saying this on opinion. I'm saying this on fact. There is only one way that the Ps3 will succeed, and that's to lower its prices. But that would cause Sony to fail. So either way, Sony has made an absolutely HORRIBLE choice on their release date, their technology, and even their public relations. Ever since Sony's Ps2 went to the top, they have been absolutely egotistical - A horrible thing for a company to do. They are now in belief that their system is going to be the next Ps2 simply because of graphics. They're wrong. An immersive game includes intuitive controls (Wii) high graphics (Ps3) and, most importantly, FUN. (Wii). Therefore, it is a safe assumption that Sony will either scrap the Ps3 or they will lower the price and hope that third party support will pick up where they left off and bring in enough money to stay afloat. Until then, the Ps3 has slim to no chance. Consider that the next time you pick up your rip-off sixaxis controller and can't play your Ps2 and PsX games.

PS3 fail because of SCE's management (I mean Mr kutaragi who was CEO of SCE).
He said PS3 is high rank restaurant and Wii is fast food. His attitude is that "if you have money you should spend that for SONY".
What kind of consumer blindly obey SONY's rule?
No one will obey that.

SONY think how much money we can get from consumer, Nintendo think how much fun we can give for consumer.

I agree with "3rdlace". Games are suppose to be fun, they wouldn't be called games if that wasn't considered.

oh oops, did sony just slakc on TRYING to make a wiimote. the sixaxis dosn't know where the controller is where ur playing it, it dosn't know how ur holding it, and it can only tilt while the wiimote can AIM directly at the screen, has a built in speaker, 4kb of memory, vibration, can tilt in any direction, and recognizes certain movements like swinging, sudden jerks of the controller, and which way it's being tilted.
pwned.

unique? seriously?

it's almost anything but unique.

hd graphics: already done

built in hard drive: done

online system: done, and done WAAAAAAAY better by live

media capabilities: done

blu-ray: done MONTHS before, and not even a garenteed success, not saying hd dvd is either, but way too risky to put in ur biggest investment.

sorry, but it's nothing new.

and for the ipod: that's gotta be the best and longest wave ever.

and sony's mp3 players are failing, along with their tv's and computers, it dosn't seem like it, but they are. this part's not my opinion, it's fact.

1) Costs half the price. Games are cheaper.

2) Wii plays all previous console games, not just some.

3) Wii has Virtual Console and several different channels to have fun with.

4) Wii has motion sensing technology.

Zelda isn't a "he". Don't even bother slagging a game or a character until you know who you are talking about...

Play through a game like Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time, and then see how you feel about what are regarded as some of the greatest adventure games of all time..

The Wii is currently the only system which truly can be considered "Next-Gen".
Sure all the systems are in the 7th generation as far as consoles go, but the PS3 (and 360 for that matter) is really just the same as the old console, with a power boost.
The Wii is the first console which really gets people moving, and physically involved in the gaming experience. Plus it's the first system that can be played by anyone... even my grandmother (84) has a great time playing WiiSports.

"The wii is simply a pimped-up gamecube with a brand new controller."
The PS3 is simply a pimped-up PS2 with a brand new logo on the controller.

Some may argue that like the Wiimote, the Sixaxis control has motion sensing capabilities, but how often have you used this ability? And do the movements with this control really simulate the action you are performing in-game? For a sword-wielding game for example, using a sixaxis would be like trying to kill someone with a cheeseburger.

You can plug in the Gamecube controller for most first-party games.

Nintendo has a completely different aim to Microsoft and Sony. Nintendo aims to make gaming fun and enjoyable for everyone, rather than to provide arcane power and mindblowing graphics. The Wii is better in that it has achieved its aim in style. It is by far outselling, even though the Xbox is cheaper. It provides a service for playing classic nintendo games, though no one would want to play classic sony games. People from 2 to 100 find this console enjoyable.
THE WII IS BETTER!

I own both systems, and I prefer the Wii. In my opinions it has a wider variety of games whereas the PS3 focuses mainly on violent games. Yes I like the PS3 but I prefer the Wii. But the Wii is getting carried away with a lot of new, lame, games.

If it comes to a well-made, powerful system with good graphics, choose an X-Box 360- far cheaper than the PS3 and boasting a similar array of games.

The Wii is far more innovative than the PS3, and appeals to a much wider audience; just look at its sales figures compared to the PS3's to see which one scores higher with consumers.

If your a serious gamer that looks for high definition graphics in games and movies (blu-ray), or i might as well say, if your looking for an entertainment system that comes with practically everything that could possibly entertain someone in most aspects, go for a PS3. but... if your someone who's looking to get slightly more active at home at the same time playing video games with considerable graphics and sharing the fun with the family, get a Wii. Whenever i play Wii with someone, its always so much more exciting, active and fun than to sit down for hours moving nothing more than your fingers and thumbs. Wii offers a whole new way of gaming experience and is just simply more exciting, plus nintendo has made much more profit from Wii than Sony has with PS3 obviously from much higher sales and is far more popular than PS3, The cashflow charts say it all.
