<b>bitterlemons:</b> Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met Sunday. How do such meetings affect the Palestinian situation?<P>

<b>Hamed:</b> Egypt assumes an important role in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and even in Palestinian-Palestinian disputes, partly because Egypt feels that all of Palestine is very important for its own political and security concerns.<P>

There is constant contact between Egypt and the Palestinian side and between Egypt and the Israeli side. Cairo tries from time to time not only to mediate between Palestinians and Israelis, but also between Palestinians and Palestinians <P>

During the withdrawal from Gaza, for example, they coordinated with both sides at the same time, and among Palestinians. So it cannot be denied that Cairo plays an important role.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> But in order to be effective, Egypt would need to have something to offer. Does Egypt have anything to offer?<P>

<b>Hamed:</b> Sometimes all they can do is just try to bring people closer or make them talk. The situation is not easy for Egypt to impose a solution or exert pressure on this side or that. It is very complicated. But Egypt tries to work and convince both sides. <P>

Until now, as you can see, Cairo's impact has not been great. At the moment, Israel is not interested either in peace talks or compromise. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why does Egypt want to play this active role? Why so different from Jordan?<P>

<b>Hamed:</b> Egypt is considered the biggest Arab country. Cairo has good relations with Israel, the Palestinians, the Americans and the Europeans. If there is a crisis, Egypt is in a good position to mediate. Also, Egypt has its own interests, compared to the Jordanians. Jordan has much less influence in the Palestinian areas. Egypt, historically, since 1948, has kept its hand in the Palestinian question, sometimes through force, sometimes with a peace process. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How important is it for Palestinians that Egypt plays the role it does?<P>

<b>Hamed:</b> We welcome their role. The Egyptians, both the government and the people, support the Palestinians and their national demands. There is a very open relationship. The only passage to the outside world from Gaza is through Egypt. Egypt has always supported Palestinian demands and the Palestinian struggle.<P>

There is an emotional and historic bond between Palestinians and Egypt. We feel that Egypt is close to us and close to our conflict and can help us. We are suffering from the Israeli aggression against us, and we need Egypt to support us and to back the Palestinian struggle. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Egypt has a fractious relationship with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. How does this affect relations with Hamas?<P>

The Muslim Brotherhood is found in Egypt, Syria and Jordan, and, yes, Hamas is also part of the Muslim Brotherhood. But we have a very clear policy of not interfering in the internal situation of any Arab country.<P>

The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Syria and Jordan will solve their own problems in their own countries. It is not easy for Hamas to talk about the Muslim Brotherhood in those countries, and it is not out job. That is the job of the local Brotherhood and leaderships in each country.- <i>Published 5/6/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
