
an interview with Zahira Kamal

<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Yesterday, you and other civil society leaders met with United States Secretary of State Colin Powell. Can you describe what was discussed?
<p>
<b>Kamal:</b> First, Mr. Powell gave a statement about the American position on the <a href="http://www.bitterlemons.org/docs/roadmap3.html">roadmap</a>, trying to give us confidence that the Americans are willing to work towards this since the Iraqi war. They are pleased with the appointment of [Palestinian Prime Minister] Abu Mazen and other things related to the roadmap, but there are still things that remain to be done: in his words, “uprooting terrorism.”
<p>
He also said that that they asked the Israelis to implement their part, to relieve the difficult conditions that Palestinians are suffering under. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What about the Palestinian response?
<p>
<b>Kamal:</b> For our part, we tried to express the difficulties of the roadmap versus people’s expectations that this time things might go forward. There were several maps given to him, one showing Israeli settlements and how they are dividing the country and depriving Palestinians of their right to build a state that has continuity. The settlements, in fact, are putting a final status agreement at risk and our fear is that the transitional state that is part of the second phase of the roadmap will also putting the final status at risk. The Israelis might use this as a defacto final status, as was done during the Oslo accords. 

<p>
Also, there was another map that showed that settlements and bypass roads [connecting the settlements] give continuity to the Israeli state and integrate the settlements into Israel, which also threatens the final negotiations. Another map on settlements showed that there are some "political settlements" that might be dismantled in the first phase [of the roadmap]. There are only 14,000 Israeli settlers living there, but this would make a big difference [for us]. 
<p>
We worry about the relationship between democracy, and supporters of peace who believe that Abu Mazen can deliver something. If their expectations are not met, then they will be frustrated and believe there is no future, which puts the peace process in danger. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How did you feel these comments were received?
<p>
<b>Kamal:</b> He didn’t talk very much; he was mostly listening. 
<p>
Personally, as I read the roadmap and compare it with the different experiences that we have had--starting with Oslo, then the Wye River Accords, and all these agreements, I feel that Palestinians are always getting less than we had before. Palestinians always have to lower their expectations. Who will be monitoring this situation? The partners are not on equal ground. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> If you feel that the roadmap is just one more concession by the Palestinians, do you think that Palestinians have any other choice other than to work with it?
<p>
<b>Kamal:</b> No. We are not rejecting the roadmap, but I cannot say that we are accepting it as it is. If the roadmap is going to end the conflict, there are some things that should be discussed. We have to look at the implications of the establishment of the state of Israel on the Palestinians. Just one of these implications was the creation of the refugee problem. How can that be solved? 
<p>
The people as a whole, as well as individuals, have a right to decide what they want to do about this. If we take look at it from a perspective of peace, then it is easy to solve the refugee problem without endangering the state of Israel. Israel has to accept the right of return, but the modalities of the right of return can be discussed. Palestinians are still living as refugees, not only outside historic Palestine, but there are also 22 refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza. These people live in misery. 
<p>
How can we solve that problem, and that of the refugees in Jordan and Lebanon and Syria? For 60 years, many of these people have been living without citizenship and without rights.
