an interview with Sami Abu Zuhri

<b>bitterlemons:</b> The Annapolis conference is just over and the US has hailed it as a success. What do you think?
</p>
<b>Abu Zuhri:</b> The meeting at Annapolis was a 100 percent failure, and not, as the Americans claim, a success. Instead of any announcement of a Palestinian state, something the US claims to support, we simply have an announcement that negotiations over such a state are to begin. These are negotiations that are already ongoing and did not need the exaggeration of Annapolis. 
</p>
Also, the Israeli declarations that followed Annapolis indicate that the meeting was a circus. [Israeli PM Ehud] Olmert today says he will not be committed to any date at the end of 2008 as the limit for finding a negotiated solution with the Palestinian side. The AmericanS also withdrew a related proposal at the United Nations upon Israeli request. 
</p>
All the indications show that the Israelis are not going to change any of their positions after the Annapolis meeting. In other words, the meeting was a charade designed to fool the Palestinians and Arab countries. The recent Israeli escalation in Gaza provides even further proof of this.
</p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> The US appears willing to reengage as mediator between Palestinians and Israelis. Is that good?
</p>
<b>Abu Zuhri:</b> America is not an honest mediator and Washington is completely biased toward Israel. The US is exerting pressure on the PA to dismantle Palestinian resistance groups while it is doing nothing to pressure the Israelis to stop their aggression.
</p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> President Mahmoud Abbas has been criticized for being willing to engage in a process with Israel. Why? Is this not a legitimate avenue to seek Palestinian goals?
</p>
<b>Abu Zuhri:</b> We have criticized Abbas because we already knew and expected such frustrating results from these meetings, especially after his failure to get a declaration of principles from the Israelis before Annapolis. Without agreement in the principles to guide negotiations how can we expect anything positive vis-a-vis the rights of Palestinians? 
</p>
The problem lies not with negotiations as such but with the occupation that denies us our rights. Negotiations are only used by Israel as a means to cover these crimes against us. Furthermore, the Palestinian side conducts negotiations in a harmful way because the PA has no resources with which to counter Israeli stubbornness. This imbalance in power make negotiations imbalanced.
</p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Hamas has been very critical of the Annapolis conference. Would Hamas have attended if invited? 
</p>
<b>Abu Zuhri:</b> The conference has finished and it is too late to answer such a question.
</p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Much has been made of threats that Hamas could use violence to derail any negotiations. Is this a possibility? What purpose would violence now serve?
</p>
<b>Abu Zuhri:</b> The Annapolis meeting has already failed so there is no need to use any resistance to derail it. Also, the resistance is not related to Annapolis or any other meeting but is linked to Israeli violence, the occupation and to regaining our rights.
</p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> If not negotiations, then what should the Palestinian presidency be seeking?
</p>
<b>Abu Zuhri:</b> The Palestinian presidency must first seek an internal dialogue between the Palestinian groups in order to reach a unified internal front. Only that way can we confront the Israeli aggression, and then wait for a suitable international and regional atmosphere to start obtaining our rights.-<i> Published 3/12/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
