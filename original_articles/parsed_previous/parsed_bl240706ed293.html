an interview with George Giacaman

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Much has been made of the timing of the Hizballah operation that saw Israeli soldiers captured not long after a similar event had taken place in Gaza and with a siege imposed on the Strip. Do you see a connection?<P>

<b>Giacaman:</b> It depends. A connection was also made, especially by Israel and others, between the operation and Iran. I think there may be a connection in timing in relation to the Palestinian conflict, but not necessarily Iran. The reasoning is the following: if Iran were behind the operation, Tehran probably wanted to make sure it would succeed. And with such a high-risk operation there is no guarantee of success. <P>

There may be a connection with the Palestinian cause, but it should not be forgotten that it has been the consistent position of Hizballah that the issue of prisoners is high on their agenda and that when the opportunity arose they would try to capture soldiers for that specific purpose. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> You say there may be a connection. What would that connection be?<P>

<b>Giacaman:</b> It's not going to relieve the siege on Gaza, but the connection was made clear following the operation in that there could be collective bargaining involving not only Lebanese, but Palestinian prisoners. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you think Israel's response in Lebanon, considering Gaza, was predictable?<P>

<b>Giacaman:</b> I think it would have been difficult to predict the Israeli response. The question is, if Hizballah had succeeded only in capturing soldiers without also inflicting casualties following the abduction, would Israel have behaved in the same way? It is a speculative question, but generally I think it was difficult to gauge the response as evidenced by the fact that Hizballah itself said it did not expect that the response would be of such ferocity.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What kind of effect will this ferocious response have on Hizballah's standing in Lebanon?<P>

<b>Giacaman:</b> There are the short and long terms. In the short term, I think there has to be a package deal involving the release of prisoners. This is the maximum gain Hizballah can get. In return, it will probably have to give some concessions, for example to accept the presence of an international force or the Lebanese Army on the border.<P>

The package deal may also involve resolving finally the issue of the Sheba'a Farms, a more complicated issue, but part of what is called the Saudi initiative. Thus, in the short term Hizballah will claim to have succeeded. 

In the long term, the question will be raised in Lebanon whether the release of prisoners was worth the cost, not only in terms of destruction, but in terms of human life. The polarization in Lebanese politics will make it possible for among others the so-called March 14 group including [Saad] Hariri and [Walid] Jumblatt to try to influence the future course of Hizballah in Lebanon by pointing out the heavy cost.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> We have seen demonstrations in many Arab countries where Hizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah's picture has featured prominently. Is Hizballah a growing force regionally?<P>

<b>Giacaman:</b> There are two separate issues. The public mood is naturally against Israeli hegemony in the region, against the Israeli occupation, against American policy in the region and for resistance. This manifests itself in support for Hizballah or Hamas, in spite of the fact that they are Islamist organizations. As a resistance they are supported by a majority of the Arab public. <P>

But in the long term it is not at all clear Hizballah will be a growing force. That very much depends on the result of this present conflict and also the future course of Hizballah. The opponents of Hizballah in Lebanon will try to rein in Hizballah as a result of this conflict. In addition, attempts will be made by various Arab parties, the US and of course Israel to try to separate Hizballah from other forces in the region. <P>

American policy for the past year-and-a-half has been to separate hotspots from each other: Lebanon from Syria, Syria from Iran, Hizballah from Syria and Iran, and Palestine from all of them. This is the very meaning of UN Security Council Resolution 1559. The Americans gave time for internal Lebanese forces to see if they could apply 1559, but they have not been able to do so completely; the only success was the withdrawal of Syrian forces.<P>

The capture of the Israeli soldiers is seen by Washington as an opportunity not to be missed to try to at least rein in Hizballah to a degree. They won't be completely successful and it won't result in disarmament, but they'll try to maximize any possible gains.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> The response to the escalation by some Arab governments--notably Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan--to blame Hizballah seems to have led to an unprecedented amount of criticism of those regimes even within their own countries. Are we seeing a weakening of these regimes?<P>

<b>Giacaman:</b> For many years, some Arab governments have been allied to the US. This is the first time they came out publicly to criticize Hizballah. This is a precedent. No doubt it will not please many a constituency within these countries, but so far these constituencies have not been able to generate any major internal threats in those countries. Nevertheless, there is an angry public mood in different countries and maybe at some time in the future it may manifest itself in a more vociferous way.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> In this context, being seen as so closely allied with the US and with the US so fully supportive of Israel, could there be a snowball effect?<P>


<b>Giacaman:</b> There could be. You have to separate the different countries. Some Gulf countries that feel a threat from Iran have publics perhaps less critical of US policy because they are primarily interested in their own survival. But in other countries like Egypt, Jordan, Syria and maybe several North African countries, the mood is different. 

It's hard to predict. I think Israel is keen to end this as soon as possible, but the longer it takes and the more scenes of destruction we see, the more angry demonstrations we'll witness in Arab countries.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Gaza has completely slipped from the headlines. How is this situation affecting the Palestinian territories?<P>

<b>Giacaman:</b> The focus is naturally on the invasion by Israel of Lebanon, and Gaza is receiving less attention than before. One reaction to this is the determined attempt to reach internal [Palestinian] agreement on a package deal with the Israelis involving release of the captured soldier and an exchange of prisoners at a later date plus a ceasefire from both sides. <P>

So far this deal has not been fixed, but it seems to be the first consequence of the Lebanon escalation: first to separate the Lebanese issue from the Palestinian issue and second, to resolve the Gaza situation independently from the Lebanese situation. This I think was the first reaction from Mahmoud Abbas and also from Hamas inside. It remains to be seen what Hamas outside would think of such a deal. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> This is a package deal negotiated among Palestinian factions. How likely is it to succeed with Israel adamantly refusing any exchange?<P>

<b>Giacaman:</b> Israel, I think, is not averse to some form of exchange along the lines reportedly brokered by Egypt to release prisoners at a later date. The problem then was there was no guarantee this would be done. These last attempts probably involve assurances from European and other countries that a deal will be done. To what extent Israel will abide by such a deal later remains to be seen. There is ample reason, based on past precedent, not to trust Israel.- <i>Published 24/7/2006 (c) bitterlemons.org <p>
