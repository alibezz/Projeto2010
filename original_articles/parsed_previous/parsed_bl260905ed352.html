<b>bitterlemons:</b> Israel has come out strongly against Hamas running for the Palestinian Legislative Council elections. Why?<P>

<b>Jarbawi:</b> I think Israel does not want the Palestinian political system to be shaped in a way that might pose problems for Israel in the future. Right now, the Palestinian political scene is dominated by one faction, Fateh, and Israel can pursue its political track with the Palestinian Authority with that in mind. If the PLC is composed of different factions and different blocs and starts questioning what the executive authority is doing especially on the peace process track, the parliament might block developments Israel would like to see take place.<P>

Another factor is that Israel considers Hamas a terrorist organization and Hamas is widely considered as such in the world. Israel is trying to take advantage of this perception to crack down on the movement because Israel is concerned about the future intentions of Hamas. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Isn't Israel just strengthening Hamas by opposing its candidacy? Won't that make Hamas more popular if the elections are held?

<b>Jarbawi:</b> This is a third factor in Israel's opposition. Israel doesn't want the elections to take place at all. If Israel cracks down on Hamas now--although it may give Hamas more credibility at the moment--it could simply lead to the elections not being held on January 25. <P>

Today [September 25] Israel arrested over 200 people in the West Bank, mainly from Hamas. With what's happening in Gaza, it could lead to a situation in which the PA will declare it cannot go on with elections, even though President Mahmoud Abbas yesterday said the elections would take place as planned.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Doesn't that leave the PA in a very difficult position? If elections aren't held won't that seem a little too convenient for Fateh?<P>

<b>Jarbawi:</b> Yes, but how can you have an election if Hamas cannot participate because most of its leaders are in prison? Hamas itself might not want an election under these circumstances. I think the PA is in a very precarious position concerning what is happening on the ground right now between Hamas and the rest of the factions and Israel. The PA cannot claim that it has authority and can bring stability to the people. Its credibility is eroding.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Should Hamas disarm before running for elections?<P>

<b>Jarbawi:</b> Well, it is not just Hamas that's armed. Fateh and its militias are armed and in fact all the factions are armed. What Abbas is trying to do is correct in principle. If you want a unified strategy for how to deal with Israel, you need to bring all of these factions into the political system. Participation in the political system is the key to reaching a unified strategy concerning arms, resistance, and all other items on the Palestinian agenda. I don't think the problem in the security, administrative, and financial spheres can be dealt with without a political solution, and that solution is to widen the participation in the political system. This is what Abbas is trying to do and this is why these elections are very important.<P>

I think Israel opposes Hamas running because it does not want this widening of the political system. Israel does not want the Palestinians to reach a unified position. Israel prefers Palestinian infighting so as to always be able to claim that the Palestinians do not deserve a political settlement, that Gaza is first and last, and they cannot end the occupation in the West Bank and Jerusalem because the Palestinians cannot reach consensus among themselves. It's a divide-and-conquer policy.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> If elections are not held what will that mean?<P>

<b>Jarbawi:</b> I think not holding the elections this past July was a mistake. Not holding them in January will be a bigger mistake. I think the current deterioration comes as a response to Israel's vocal opposition to Hamas' participation. I think Hamas is very interested in participating and if elections are not held, the internal as well as the external situation, i.e., the situation with Israel, will deteriorate. - <i>Published 26/9/2005 (c) bitterlemons.org<P>
