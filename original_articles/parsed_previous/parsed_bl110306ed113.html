<b>bitterlemons:</b> Did you expect to become prime minister?<P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> I imagined that one day Hamas would be at the helm of power, but at the personal level I never thought about any position or seat because this is not part of our education. This position, however, is a mandate from the people first and Hamas second. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What were the main points and conditions included in the letter of commission you received from President Mahmoud Abbas?<P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> The letter did not include any conditions. President Abbas spoke about the components of his political vision, but without stipulating conditions. While forming its political platform, the government takes into consideration all political issues. However, it must also preserve the vision on which the movement based its electoral platform. At the moment we are searching for common ground. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What are the main components of the new government's political platform?<P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> I do not want to go into detail about the political platform of the government because there are still ongoing discussions with other factions. I can say, however, that the government's political platform is based on Hamas' electoral program. The wording may eventually be different in order to absorb other political outlooks. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Where have you reached in your discussions on forming a unity government with Fateh?<P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> We have repeated time and again that we would prefer a national coalition government in which all the factions participate including the brothers in Fateh. We are striving for this through our intensive discussions and meetings with everyone. Until now, Fateh has not given an official response; everything being said about its refusal to join the government is media speculation. Furthermore, [Fateh's] Revolutionary Council left any decision until the outcome of talks with Hamas was clear. <P>

We are interested in Fateh's participation given that it is a major faction and has a long history, in addition to it being in the Palestinian Authority. I believe national interests also necessitate its participation. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What if Fateh refuses to join? <P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> If Fateh will not join, we will move on with other factions. Our discussions with the other factions have progressed well and there is preliminary agreement with the PFLP, the DFLP, the Independent Palestine Bloc and Badil to join the government in addition to a number of independents.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is there a possibility of including Fateh personalities in the government if Fateh refuses to join as a movement?<P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> We have addressed Fateh as a faction and in an official capacity but we have no problem looking into different options.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What about the security services? Will you face difficulties in controlling them, since most of their members are affiliated to Fateh?<P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> We believe the security services must work for the benefit of the people and not for the benefit of a certain group. They should also work within the context of the law so there will not be any violations that would affect the performance of these services. I am confident that the relationship between the security services and the government will be fine and run smoothly. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> In this context, what kind of person are you looking to appoint to take over the interior ministry?<P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> We are looking for a personality who is well established in his relationships and is not a new face to the security services. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How will the new government fight corruption? <P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> Let me say here that following up on the corruption files will be dictated by several considerations: first, the judiciary and the law must be followed; second, we need a gradual reform process; and third, we will not take any steps that throw PA institutions into confusion.<P> 

In our last meeting, President Abbas confirmed that he would continue to present files to the attorney general. As a government, we will follow up on these files in a way that coincide with the people's interests. <P>

One of the government's top priorities is to put the Palestinian house in order. We want to restore respect for the law and the judiciary authority. These are crucial issues, but they demand patience.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How will the Hamas government deal with any armed group that abducts foreigners or carries out other acts provoking security chaos?<P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> There are several aspects to the issue of security, including family feuds and the abduction of foreigners. These issues must be dealt with regardless of political affiliation. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> But what would happen if there were a kidnapping after Hamas took power?<P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> The government will do its duty in providing protection. We will act wisely. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What is your response to reports that the US and western parties are working to undermine a Hamas-led government?<P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> There is no doubt that the elections in general and Hamas' victory in particular threw these parties off balance. This has made them put forward contradictory positions after losing their "compass" in dealing with the election results.<P>

There are also media-inspired efforts to confine our jurisdictions and place obstacles in our way by belittling our platform. However, we have what it takes to succeed and we will offer a good model of governance and general administration. <P>

I don't think President Abbas will entertain any proposals to reduce the jurisdiction of the government. He actually told me this in our last meeting where he reaffirmed that he would offer the government all the jurisdictions he previously offered when he became president after the late President Yasser Arafat. <P>

There are also contacts with and signals from various EU countries and others, including Japan, which confirm their commitment to supporting the Palestinian people. <P>

After the government is formed, the nature of its regional and international relationships will become clear and the government's performance in the various aspects of Palestinian life will become apparent. Those who have rejected the Hamas government will find themselves before a new reality that they must deal with. In spite of everything being said in the press about threats [to this government], I am still optimistic.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What did Hamas achieve from its Russia visit?<P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> The results of the Russia visit were positive and we achieved our goals in terms of penetrating the international arena through a major country and a member of the UN Security Council. Russia is also a member of the Quartet and has a long history in the region. <P>

We listened to them and they listened to us and our mutual assessments were positive. We were informed by the Russians via their ambassador in Damascus that the Russian leadership was comfortable with the visit. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Hamas maintains that it will not abandon the armed resistance. How will Hamas strike a balance between that pledge and its responsibilities as a government?<P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> The underlying problem remains the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and the continuing Israeli assaults against our people. During the [current] period of calm, the [Palestinian] factions have proved that they were not the problem and have been willing to work with the calm. <P>

Furthermore, self-defense is a legitimate right and we will handle the resistance in a way that serves our people. That is our responsibility as a government.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Recently, Israeli officials said you were not immune from assassination. What is your response?<P>

<b>Haniyeh:</b> These threats are nothing new and they are part of the general Israeli escalation against our people as well as public figures. They are also part of the whole atmosphere surrounding the Israeli elections. Such escalation and threats have always been used for Israeli electoral purposes. I am not afraid and I have faith that God decides every person's time.- <i>Published 13/3/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
