<b>bitterlemons:</b> When you remember the time that you spent negotiating <a href="http://www.bitterlemons.org/docs/dop.html">the Oslo accords</a>, do you remember it fondly, or is it troubling?
<p>
<b>Abu-Libdeh:</b> This is an experience that I am not totally happy with and also not totally unhappy with. After many years of total Israeli blockade on the recognition of Palestinian rights, to come forward--regardless of how--and sit on the other side of the table and start talking with the Palestinians about their rights and aspirations was in itself a serious undertaking, one we got into hoping that we would eventually come to everlasting peace. 
<p>
Of course, during the negotiations, we had many ups and downs because on the one hand, so many "trivial" issues (from the Palestinian perspective) were met with total Israeli denial. We realized that the Israelis were able to stall the negotiations and delay a lot of progress, just because they are the mighty power and we are a very weak partner. 
<p>
On the other hand, we came to know more of the worries of the Israeli side, their aspirations for the future, and we managed to pass on to the Israelis the kind of aspirations that we have for our people and the fact that the Palestinians are equally worthy of a state on their own soil, after all.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Can you give an example of one of these "trivial" issues?
<p>
<b>Abu-Libdeh:</b> For example, as far as the Palestinians are concerned, historic Palestine is Palestinian territory. For us and the Israelis to spend so much time discussing whether we have legitimate rights in the West Bank and Gaza, including Jerusalem, from our perspective was a very trivial thing. From the Israeli perspective, on the other hand, it was negotiable. Whenever they questioned the content of [United Nations Resolution] 242, whenever they tried to deny it or give a special explanation to 242, it was for us a triviality used by the Israelis to stall the negotiations. 
<p>
But we also came to know many Israeli negotiators who, on a personal level, were understanding and maybe in agreement with our aspirations, but on an official level were not able to even come close to recognizing Palestinian aspirations.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> It is now ten years later and in many respects Oslo has been voided. What achievements do Palestinians still cling to?
<p>
<b>Abu-Libdeh:</b> The fact that we are no longer discussing whether or not we have legitimate rights, the international consensus that there is a need for a Palestinian state--although with some requirements--are both direct results of Oslo. Some of the relationships that the Palestine Liberation Organization had with some members of the international community were very much conditional, compared to today when members of the international community deal with us on almost equal footing.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> In hindsight, what aspects of the accords have proven to be disastrous?
<p>
<b>Abu-Libdeh:</b> There is one fundamental aspect: the fact that the Oslo agreement was based on the principle of good will and good performance. The Palestinians didn’t perform well in terms of realization of the Oslo agreement vis-&agrave;-vis their entity and also, the transitional aspect of the agreement has proved to be very seriously defective because there was a lot of bad faith. 
<p>
I think that the agreement was fully dependent on the good faith of both sides. Each side had its own clock in terms of how to deal with the agreement and the applications of the agreement. When it came to reality, we realized that these expectations and modalities were not necessarily based on good faith.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> If Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had not been killed, would it have worked?
<p>
<b>Abu-Libdeh:</b> I think the difference between Rabin and the rest of the Israeli leadership was that he had a fundamental change of direction vis-&agrave;-vis his perception of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship. He was keen on reaching some kind of an arrangement that would be acceptable to Israelis with minimum harm, and that would be able to provide the Palestinians with the minimum requirements for establishing a state. I cannot say that if he had not been killed, the situation would be fundamentally different. I think that each side had theorized a compromising situation that was not close enough to the other sides’. 
<p>
Even with Rabin, we would have had problems, but at least the Rabin-Arafat relationship was a little more frank and candid. They could have avoided some of the mishaps that we are seeing now.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How would you say that the Oslo accords altered the way that Palestinians think about themselves?
<p>
<b>Abu-Libdeh:</b> First of all, before the Oslo agreement, we knew very little about what we could really reach with the Israelis. We had the [UN] resolution; the resolution has some very theoretical strategic goals that it wants to achieve. 
<p>
Suddenly, out of the blue, we have come to realize that an agreement will definitely test what constitutes the Palestinian population. It introduced, probably for the first time, the very real challenge of looking for a potential solution to the refugee issue. The Palestinians have started to realize that the Palestinian state will be a state of the population of the West Bank and Gaza, with some arrangements for the diaspora. The Palestinians, for the first time, have started to look inward to see what compromises they will have to make concerning the rest of the [issues] that have been postponed. 
<p>
This is why I think that the Oslo agreement has presented a very serious challenge to 
the Palestinians in terms of settling some questions that they have avoided: concerning their identity, their relationship to Palestinians outside Palestine, their relationship to Israeli Palestinians in Israel and so on.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Palestinians often give their prescription for a real return to negotiations: Israel’s demonstration of intent through troop withdrawals and a prisoner release and a halt in settlement construction. But in your mind, how can Palestinians contribute to that transformation of Israeli society? Or can they only wait?
<p>
<b>Abu-Libdeh:</b> Palestinians are committing one of their biggest mistakes in not reaching out to Israeli public opinion. I think the Palestinians have a very serious and just cause, but the problem is that they are not demonstrating to the Israeli public, through various mediums, that they mean business and that they have produced the historic compromise of accepting Israel as a neighbor and that much of the violence and fundamentalism that is taking place is due to the harsh realities within Palestinian society and economy and the harsh treatment by the Israeli military of the Palestinian population. 
<p>
The Israelis have consistently failed to realize that the Palestinians’ experience with Israelis is always one of shame and humiliation. The Palestinians’ first-hand experience with an Israeli is either with settlers or jailers or army officers or employers in Israel. In all these cases, there is a huge inequality in terms of treatment. This is true for the Israelis, too; they typically see a Palestinian in the form of a terrorist or a suicide bomber. 
<p>
The Palestinians haven’t had their big leap forward in reaching out to Israeli society, and Israelis have not worked hard enough to earn the privilege of being a good neighbor to the Palestinians.
