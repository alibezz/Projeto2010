<b>bitterlemons:</b> Have there been any official or unofficial contacts between Hamas and Israel on a ceasefire?<P>

<b>Yousef:</b> There have been no official contacts between Hamas and Israel. What has happened is that the Egyptians approached Hamas regarding a short ceasefire, to allow Cairo time to mediate an end to the embargo on Gaza, perhaps an opening of the gate to Egypt and maybe the other crossings into Israel. The calm is meant for a short period, but I hope it will open the door for a more comprehensive and reciprocal ceasefire. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> You say a short period. Is there a timeframe?<P>

<b>Yousef:</b> We are talking about a week, ten days of calm, in the hope that this will lay the foundation for further Egyptian mediation. Right now Cairo is consulting with everybody regarding the terms for a ceasefire.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> There is no talk of any direct contacts?<P>

<b>Yousef:</b> No<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> And what are Hamas' terms for a ceasefire?<P>

<b>Yousef:</b> We have told Egypt that we want an end to all Israeli aggression--that means any military activities on the border, any incursions into Gaza or air strikes targeting the people or political and military leaders. We also want an end to the blockade and a lifting of sanctions.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Should Israel agree, will this ceasefire extend to all groups or only Hamas?<P>

<b>Yousef:</b> I think this will apply to all Palestinian military factions. Once Hamas and Islamic Jihad agree on the terms, I am sure the rest of the smaller groups will abide by the ceasefire. But this will be something the government, Hamas and Islamic Jihad will discuss with the groups.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> In the longer term, will this open the door for Hamas, in particular, and Israel to seek direct contact in the future?<P>

<b>Yousef:</b> I believe this will open the door for Palestinians to talk to each other, i.e., for Fateh and Hamas to reconcile their differences in order to strengthen the internal Palestinian situation and to fix the power-sharing system. If we form a unity government, it will mean that when Abu Mazen [Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas] continues his negotiations with Israel he will have greater support behind him and that will strengthen his position.<P>

Hamas will not go and talk with Israel. From our experience of previous negotiations, Israel cannot be trusted to carry out its commitments. So we prefer that we fix our political system and let Abu Mazen continue negotiating, on the condition that he consults with Hamas regarding the terms of any possible document he seeks to sign with Israel. <P>

All contacts between Hamas and Israel will have to go through a third party.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> You say that from past experience Israel cannot be trusted. Why, then, do you think Israel is interested in a ceasefire now and will remain committed to it?<P>

<b>Yousef:</b> I believe Israel knows that if it continues its military incursions and attacks on Palestinian cities and towns, it will only provoke Hamas rocket fire and that Hamas is capable of extending the range of these rockets to strike major Israeli cities near Gaza, including Ashkelon and Ashdod. This will create serious domestic problems for [Israeli Prime Minister Ehud] Olmert's government. A ceasefire can fix some of these problems. <P>

I also believe that [Israeli Defense Minister Ehud] Barak has worked out that there is no easy incursion into Gaza. Any such incursion will be met by fierce resistance and retaliation in the West Bank and inside Israel. This is what happened in Jerusalem recently, when Israel's military attacks in Gaza provoked people in the West Bank and Jerusalem to take revenge. <P>

Also Hamas itself will act to exact revenge. Hamas will not just accept a high number of casualties and women and children being killed.<P>

Finally, perhaps, there may be, for the first time, a realization by the Americans and Abu Mazen that Hamas represents something and cannot be defeated. Hamas remains in control in Gaza and every day it is becoming stronger. The longer they wait for Hamas to collapse, the stronger it gets, whether in terms of public support or in terms of governance. In eight months we have not seen any collapse in the ability of Hamas to govern Gaza or any shortage of employees to run Gazan affairs.<P>

Perhaps too Israel does not wish to provoke Arab leaders in the lead-up to the Damascus summit, forcing them to cancel the Arab initiative.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you see signs that a unity government is back in the cards?<P>

<b>Yousef:</b> There is a Yemeni initiative, and maybe Abu Mazen is serious about implementing this proposal. A Hamas delegation is due to go to Yemen to meet with President Ali Abdullah Saleh and express Hamas' reservations regarding certain terms in the Yemeni initiative. If this delegation is convinced, then I think a dialogue will start that could lay the basis for an initiative that the Arab summit will endorse or at least follow up on.- <i>Published 17/3/2008 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
