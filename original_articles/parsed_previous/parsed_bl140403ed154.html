
an interview with Mudar Kassis

</table>

<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What is your reaction as an Arab, as a Palestinian and as an analyst to the events in Iraq?
<p>
<b>Kassis:</b> It is a mixed reaction. The first part of it has to do with the extent of foreign intervention in the region. The other has to do with the obvious changes that are taking place in the so-called "world order." The third has to do with the ability of a totalitarian regime to stand for its country. These three things go in different directions, and it is difficult to give a single comprehensive analysis.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Can you explain more?
<p>
<b>Kassis:</b> The war in Iraq raised a serious question about whether we are now in a neo-imperial era or not. The idea of a superpower just going ahead with something without United Nations decisions poses the question for many countries: will they find themselves in the same situation in the near or farther future? 
<p>
This eventually will lead to a change in international relations and diplomacy. The immediate results of this war will be a change towards conservatism in the attitudes of many small countries. Opening up to the world seems no longer of great benefit to everybody, as it was in recent years. I think many countries will reconsider being open to UN organizations and the world community, whether in the areas of weaponry or economics or otherwise.
<p>
Concerning what you might call “the world order,” there is now a growing factor (it is not a new factor--it existed in the sixties and during the Vietnam War) of massive worldwide public interest in world politics. I think that this revitalization and its role in world politics has to be taken into consideration. So far we haven’t seen its effects on the decision-making process, perhaps with the exception of Germany, but I think that it will begin to be taken into consideration.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> In the Arab world as well?
<p>
<b>Kassis:</b> This will also affect the Arab world, if you bear in mind the third component of the analysis, which includes a situation where the Iraqi regime could not depend on the Iraqi people to defend it. This raises a question of how much a government can enter into conflict with its own nation. Usually a government can count on national feelings, but if a country like Iraq with a very strong nationalistic tradition could not, then this poses a question for many Arab regimes: how can they defend against external intervention by other nations? 
<p>
Put together with the populist factor in world politics, slowly but surely we will be viewing some changes in the Arab world.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> So you think that the civic relationship will improve?
<p>
<b>Kassis:</b> It might eventually improve, but it will take a little bit of give-and-take and some confrontation. Now everyone will have to measure once again how far they can go, and during this "testing time," things might happen.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What about the war’s effect on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict?
<p>
<b>Kassis:</b> I can’t think of any major effects that can be thought of as direct results of the war in Iraq on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the situation in Palestine. The widespread analysis that tries to equivocate between the situation now and the first Gulf War is baseless, I would say. The situation is completely different now, especially because the situation in Palestine and in the Palestinian community is a different one. 
<p>
But the process of strangulation by the Israelis of the Palestinians has been coming to an end. There was a question of whether Israel could extend this further in the context of the war in Iraq, but the answer is clear and it was “no”. Now, minor changes will likely happen in the situation here, but they should not be seen as a result of the Iraqi war. 
<p>
There was previously an urgent need to do something about the conflict and this “something” was postponed because of the Iraqi war. Now that it is over, or when it is over, this postponement has to stop. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How would you put into context Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon’s comments about settlements to Ha’aretz newspaper? 
<p>
<b>Kassis:</b> I thought the main comments were made by the journalist, not by Sharon. I didn’t see that Sharon said anything new. The idea of painful concessions has been repeated, the idea of agreeing with the American administration has been there, the idea of agreeing with the Bush speech was already there, the idea of the establishment of a Palestinian state was also already there. 
<p>
The major thing that I found interesting in this interview was the question put as to whether the moment of truth has arrived. Sharon’s response was not negative. 
<p>
The major difference now will be how the international community--and the Quartet in particular--approaches the implementation of the <a href="http://www.bitterlemons.org/docs/roadmap2.html">roadmap</a>. Will there be leeway to keep the map without a map, so to speak, or will there be some sort of enforcement for its implementation? I don’t think that this depends on Sharon’s will, but on the kind of pressure that is put on Israel.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you think that the current back-and-forth between Syria and the United States will have an effect on the Palestinian-Israeli track?
<p>
<b>Kassis:</b> It is too early to judge. I am not sure what is behind the tension. It might be a tactic used by the Americans to make sure that Syria does not support or aid some sort of resistance from Syria in Iraq that will make the life of American rule harder. There exists another analysis that asks “who is next after Iraq?” but I don’t think that it is the right time to make such judgments. We have still not seen an overall picture of the American attitude towards the world in general after Iraq. It is possible there will be euphoria over winning the war, or there could be drawbacks when it is shown that, even in Iraq, it is not easy to control things.
