For the Israeli public, the news of the decision to release 198 Palestinian prisoners sentenced on terrorist charges came as a puzzling surprise. Nobody understands the reason or the rationale for this move. It is of course being presented as a gesture to the Abu Mazen (President Mahmoud Abbas) wing of the Palestinian Authority. <P>

Here are a few guesses as to the reasons behind the move. If Israel engages in a massive release of hundreds of terrorists within the framework of a deal to get Gilad Shalit back home, this will be registered as a huge Hamas achievement, thus further weakening Abu Mazen--so let's do something in advance to boost his position. That could be counted as a reason, and the conduct of Hamas since the announcement, opposing this move by Israel, suggests that this reading is correct. We can also see the move as a supposedly sophisticated but actually clumsy psychological warfare ploy to stir up public opinion among Palestinians so that internal pressure pushes Hamas to conclude prisoner-exchange negotiations whereby hundreds of Palestinian families can at last rejoice with their released loved ones. <P>

But all of these considerations cannot change the feeling that this is a misconceived act by the Israeli government. There are the general strategic political reasons against such gestures by Israel and there are reasons of principle as well. This kind of empty gesture suggests that the onus of peace process obligations has shifted. Instead of the Palestinians fulfilling their obligations since the roadmap was launched about five years ago, Israel has once again been maneuvered into the corner of the accused--the partner who hasn't done enough to pump the political fuel of optimism to the peace-line express. <P>

For their part, the Palestinians have no motivation to hurry. They are content to change their propaganda and adopt a psychological warfare tool of their own. They point to a new horizon: the famous one-state solution. The terrorist arch-enemy applies for citizenship in Israel. Meanwhile, Israel and the international community no longer insist on the demands that were earlier accepted as prerequisites for advancing toward a final settlement. These conditions are familiar: stopping terrorist activity, establishing the rule of law by Palestinians' own law-enforcement organizations, reforming those organizations and so forth. But who remembers those demands? We are all attached to imaginary negotiations for a shelf-agreement that means only one thing: Israeli concessions will be signed as a bill of debt--to be paid if and when. <P>

This is a deceitful way to bypass an Israeli public that has completely lost faith in the possibility of reaching peace with the Palestinians. Meanwhile, the two sides have been engaged in other kinds of negotiations, for a short-term ceasefire with Hamas and the release of Gilad Shalit. No doubt such political sideshows would play out to the detriment of Palestinian interest in a peaceful final settlement if the de facto political vacuum on both sides did not in any case forestall any likelihood of progress, whether in peace talks or contacts with Hamas.<P>
 
This entire process hurts Israel and erodes its credibility, not only as a political partner but as a democratic state with a judicial system whose judgments must be seen as absolutely credible. Ever since the Oslo accords, Israel has drifted from a firm position that carries weight and credibility to a shaky and undefined position in which its words sometimes don't count at all. This is serious erosion. Israel's strength stems from its ability to stand by its promises and obligations: when it threatens, its threat should be credible; when it makes a commitment, it should be fulfilled without fraud. <P>

A huge release of prisoners that is not anchored in some kind of settlement undermines all those basics that Israeli sovereignty and national honor rest upon. Most important, deterrence against terrorism is based on a firm concept of the rule of law. It undermines the Israeli legal system if illegal fighters engaged in the murder of civilians are not held to their crimes. It hints to the Arabs and to international as well as Israeli public opinion that we don't take seriously our own rhetoric about terrorism and the war on terrorism. In the end, this process blurs the line between fighters on both sides of the battlefield and civilians. It validates the worst judgments made by war criminals in the wars of the twentieth century: that there are no "innocents"; that the entire enemy camp is engaged and responsible and is therefore a legitimate target. <P>

The release of terrorist prisoners is therefore a mistake on the principled level of strategic, judicial and moral conduct.- <i>Published 25/8/2008 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
