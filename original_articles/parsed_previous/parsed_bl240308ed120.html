The growing global financial crisis will not be a significant factor in the resolution, or for that matter the ongoing deterioration, of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The past 40 years of Israeli occupation, full and partial, have witnessed a variety of attempts to alleviate or solve the conflict along with two prolonged intifadas and several additional Israel-Arab wars, all of which have demonstrated that the conflict is affected primarily by politics, not economics. <P>

The ups and downs of the Israeli economy or the global economy have never been a significant factor in determining the direction of the conflict. Nor have the economic pressures of conflict radically affected the cycle of prosperity and recession in Israel. Moreover, since 1967 virtually all Israeli governments, and particularly ministers of defense, have implemented a broad spectrum of economic carrots and sticks with the objective of manipulating the Palestinian political will--with little or no effect on the overall attitude of Palestinians toward Israelis and the conflict.<P>

Carrots? Since 1994, the international community has invested huge sums in developing a Palestinian infrastructure and security services and propping up the governing bureaucracy of the Palestinian Authority. Currently, Quartet emissary Tony Blair is in charge of such a program, toward which seven billion dollars have been pledged by the international community. Israel has agreed to take measures to enable a smoother functioning of the Palestinian economy. <P>

But the benefits for the political process are at best debatable. Indeed, arguably the huge sums of international aid showered upon the Palestinian leadership over the past decade and a half have been an important factor in generating the corruption that caused Palestinians to install a Hamas leadership two years ago. Moreover, as PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad can attest from past experience, even wealthy donors who are not affected by a global economic crisis, like the oil-rich Saudis and Emiraties, frequently avoid making good on their aid pledges.<P>

Sticks? In recent months and years, Israel and the Quartet have imposed severe political sanctions on the Gaza Strip due to Hamas rule there and ongoing aggression against Israeli civilians. But the Hamas regime in Gaza has merely been strengthened and is more popular than ever.<P>

Thus if, as anticipated, the growing international financial crisis generates the imposition of new limits and constraints on the amount of aid flowing to the West Bank, this will almost certainly not be a primary factor in determining the outcome of peace efforts. <P>

To be sure, economic prosperity is as good for Palestinians as it is for everyone else. But there is not even a positive and demonstrable cause-and-effect connection between prosperity and a reduction in the inclination to engage in terrorism: witness the solid economic background of the 9/11 perpetrators and, closer to home, the outbreak of the second intifada at a time of relative Palestinian economic prosperity.<P>

Of course, Israelis and Palestinians will feel the negative effects of a sharp global economic downturn. The red-hot Israeli economy will cool down. Less aid will flow to the Palestinians. In projects involving the building of Palestinian civil society--a key foundation for a successful democracy--and laying the long-term foundations for civilized coexistence,  the denial of aid by donor governments and foundations, due to their own financial setbacks, could be truly unfortunate.<P>

Then, too, the United States government is liable, for the foreseeable future, to concentrate far more on domestic American economic dilemmas than on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. When it does look at the Middle East, it will focus more on oil and Iraq, due to the huge economic implications of these issue areas, than on Israel-Palestine.<P>

But that is precisely the point: our conflict is not primarily an economic issue. The causes are political and the solution is political.- <i>Published 24/3/2008 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
