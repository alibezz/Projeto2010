The bombing operation that took place in Tel Aviv 10 days ago was an exception to the state of calm that President Mahmoud Abbas had been able to negotiate with the Palestinian factions. As a result, the Palestinian political scene was thrown into disarray given its overall interest in continuing the calm, a calm that has been more or less mutual notwithstanding regular Israeli violations here and there. <P>

The factions responded by competing as to how fast they could deny responsibility for the operation, each reaffirming its commitment to the calm. In return, and for all its ranting and raving, the Israeli government let the bombing pass without carrying out any direct military action that would signal the end of this period of calm. <P>

It seems clear then that both sides are interested in maintaining the quiet even if only for their own interests. But while there seems to be a consensus over this for the time being, the question is, how long will this consensus continue and what will mark its end?<P>

It is clear that the Israeli government is interested in the continuation of the calm as long as it achieves two important things. The first is stability in the internal security situation to restore confidence in Israeli citizens who have been unsettled by the loss of personal security throughout the Intifada. The bombing operations in Israeli restaurants and buses and the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip on Sderot have exacted a high political price for the Israeli government and for its prime minister, Ariel Sharon in particular. At the internal Israeli level, this has been manifested in complaints that the government is incapable and ineffective in doing what is necessary to protect its citizens. <P>

The second is to ensure certain realities before a final settlement. One is to complete the separation wall that cuts Jerusalem from its surroundings and effectively annexes huge areas of the West Bank to Israel. Another is by carrying out the unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. <P>

The Palestinian Authority can also benefit from the state of calm. On the one hand, it wants to take advantage of the time to rebuild its own capabilities and regain its status, which were extensively damaged throughout the years of the intifada at the various internal, regional and international levels. The PA also wants--via this state of calm--to return to negotiations with Israel with the aim of finding a political settlement that would lead to the end of the occupation and the establishment of a Palestinian state. <P>

On the Palestinian side, however, one must also consider the interests of the factions, especially Hamas and Islamic Jihad. It seems apparent through the many messages conveyed by these factions that they do have an interest in maintaining the calm. However, this interest is temporary and conditional, and if their interests are not solidified the current calm will not turn into a truce agreement. On the contrary, it may be in the interest of the factions after a certain time to indirectly end this state of calm by provoking Israel into carrying out an armed action. <P>

The interests of these factions are two-fold. The first is related to Israel and the outside world and the second is an internal Palestinian matter. The factions have been subjected to escalating violent Israeli targeting throughout the Intifada as a result of their resistance. Both leaders and activists have been subject to arrest, assassination, or punished through house demolitions. In addition, the factions have been targeted from abroad, especially by the American administration, which put them on their "list of terrorist organizations" and has sought to impose a regional and international boycott, European in particular. <P>

This targeting has negatively impacted the capabilities and potentials of these factions. If the situation continues, they will suffer a real setback. It should be mentioned that the largest of the factions, Hamas, is in essence a political and pragmatic movement and not a dogmatic one. It wants growth and continuation for itself and not extinction. The calm gives these factions a chance to catch their breath. It also gives them the opportunity to move from resistance action to political action. <P>

In this sense, the calm represents a gateway for the factions to re-legitimize themselves politically. This is necessary in an area where there has been a declared "open season" on them. This is a crucial stage, which only those who are able to make the necessary transformations will overcome. But this gate will not open unless these factions' relationship with the Palestinian Authority changes. <P>

The calm will continue and turn into a truce if the opportunity is presented to these factions to enter and participate in the Palestinian political system. It is not true that these factions are the ones opposing entering the system. It is the exclusion of the factions from this system in the past that has prevented them from participating. <P>

Of course, there are benefits in maintaining the status quo for those who are part of the system. And no doubt, if benefits for those outside the system are not achieved, they will not join. The "calm" has been granted Abu Mazen because the factions sensed through their mutual dialogue that there is an opportunity to become a partner rather than a subordinate in a Palestinian political system, thereby to achieve a vital part of their legitimate political aims. From this aspect, the calm can be considered a positive sign toward removing the impasse from which the political system has been suffering since the signing of the Oslo Accords. <P>

Based on the aforementioned, maintaining this calm needs internal and practical Palestinian steps to reassure the factions that their participation in the political system is truly possible. It must also be reiterated that their exclusion from this partnership is a main and direct reason for the tension both internally and with Israel. Therefore this state of exclusion must end and the process of including these factions in the political system must be facilitated. <P>

Conducting local and legislative elections that are free, honest and credible is one of the most important steps in ensuring the entrance of these factions into the Palestinian political system. Hence, PA officials should do whatever is necessary to get the Legislative Council Elections Law approved and ensure that PLC elections are conducted according to their scheduled date, July 2005, in addition to completing local council elections. These elections will allow the factions to participate in the PA, not only at the level of rights and authority but also in terms of assuming duties and responsibilities. <P>

Israel and the United States must understand this. If they are interested in long-term calm and not just a limited period, they must contribute to the transformation process. In this regard, Israel must commit to complete reciprocity in terms of the calm. It is unacceptable that Israel carries out violations on a daily basis, even it they are less egregious than previous major aggressions. That is assuming, of course, that the Israeli goal is not to maintain the current level of tension.<P>

Also, Israel must begin to carry out the obligations required of it in order to seriously move forward toward a political settlement. It is not acceptable that pressure continues on the Palestinians while settlements, the wall and land confiscations continue apace. 

As for the United States, it must lead a political settlement process more effectively and more honestly. It must also change its negative attitude toward the Palestinian resistance factions.- <i>Published 7/3/2005 (c) bitterlemons.org<P>
