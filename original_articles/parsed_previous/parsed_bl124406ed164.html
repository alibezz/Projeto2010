an interview with Iyad Barghouti

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Would it be accurate to place Mahmoud Abbas somewhere between Hamas and Israel?<P>

<b>Barghouti:</b> If there is such a space in the middle between them, then yes. In some ways he is even closer to Israel, because on some issues the main partner is Israel, not Hamas. But it would be better if he were between Hamas and Fateh.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> There have been suggestions, notably from Hamas leaders abroad, that Abbas, or at least Fateh, is engaged in some kind of conspiracy against Hamas. Do you think this is true?<P>

<b>Barghouti:</b> In the beginning, Hamas didn't consider Abbas as 100 percent Fateh, and Hamas thought it could reach a better compromise with him than with Fateh. I think Hamas leaders even thought they had rescued Abu Mazen from Fateh. Now, I think they've started to consider him as part of this, let's say conspiracy, if you like.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What changed?<P>

<b>Barghouti:</b> Hamas at first wanted Abu Mazen to be the link between it and the Israelis and relieve it of the responsibility for negotiations on political issues so Hamas could, as it puts it, keep its hands pure and clean from negotiating with Israel.<P>

But now I think Hamas thinks Abbas is doing Fateh's bidding by taking decisions that are weakening the government as part of a conspiracy to weaken Hamas.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is this suspicion justified?<P>

<b>Barghouti:</b> To some extent, yes. Some of the decisions taken by the PLC immediately after the elections to transfer more powers from the government into the hands of the presidency justify that belief.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> But to what extent are Abbas' hands forced, considering Israel and the international community have effectively boycotted the PA?<P>

<b>Barghouti:</b> True, he doesn't have many options open to him, but at least he should coordinate with the government. Any step the president takes should be taken as part of a dialogue with the government.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you see any signs of such a dialogue emerging?<P>

<b>Barghouti:</b> It has to. Things are getting worse. When things go to the street and there are clashes between Fateh and Hamas supporters then things are getting worse.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How dangerous is the situation?<P>

<b>Barghouti:</b> It's very dangerous. There is a complete lack of trust between the two sides and this might lead to a full-blown conflict.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> A new government has yet to be formed in Israel. What role will it play regarding the internal Palestinian situation?<P>

<b>Barghouti:</b> The Israelis are behaving as if they have left the issue to the Palestinians, and maybe a conflict between Fateh and Hamas is something Israel would like to see. Perhaps the Hamas government will face problems, but then all Palestinian society will face problems.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you think a conflict between Fateh and Hamas will really benefit Israel?<P>

<b>Barghouti:</b> In some ways yes and in some ways no. A real internal Palestinian conflict might leave Israel free to impose its unilateral separation as it pleases. On the other hand, Israel would have to deal with an unstable neighbor and that could have negative ramifications for Israel.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> And in all this, what role does the international community play?<P>

<b>Barghouti:</b> The international community has played a very negative role. It should accept the results of the elections. The international community might not like Hamas, but it is a democratically elected government. Preventing aid and support from reaching the West Bank and Gaza is a move people here simply cannot understand.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> To what extent might the position of the international community be shaped by a clear understanding between Abbas and Hamas?<P>

<b>Barghouti:</b> I hope the international community will rethink its position toward the government and toward Abbas. If Israel starts negotiating with Abbas with positive intent, such a step could help.<P> 

But to boycott Hamas, to boycott Abbas and boycott every Palestinian is a very negative position. The West thinks it will make the government collapse, but if it does we will be left with no government. Anyone who thinks the collapse of the Hamas government will bring back Fateh is being unrealistic. - <i>Published 24/4/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org.<P>
