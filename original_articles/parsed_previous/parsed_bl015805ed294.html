<b>bitterlemons:</b> You're opposed to disengagement. Can the anti-disengagement camp succeed at this late date in preventing it? <P>

<b>Arens:</b> I'm highly doubtful. Although this is the land of miracles, I'm not holding my breath.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why is unilateral disengagement going to be bad for Israel?<P>

<b>Arens:</b> First and foremost because it encourages terror. The Palestinians don't hide their jubilation and conviction that this is a direct result of their use of terror. This will encourage further terror. We were successful in the battle against terrorism until this idea came along. It's not part of any treaty obligation. Even [PM Mahmoud] Abbas declares from Gaza that Jerusalem is next.<P>

Secondly, this is a blatant violation of the rights of Israeli citizens. It could not happen in any other democratic country. [Presidents] Bush and Chirac praise [PM] Sharon, yet know that in their countries you couldn't pull 8,000 people out of their homes.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What will be the effect on Israeli-Palestinian political relations? <P>

<b>Arens:</b> I've noted that this encourages terrorism.  But I can't foretell the future. I can't totally discount a positive effect on Palestinian political dynamics. There is a possibility that this will bring about a change of mood among the Palestinians, [to the effect that] they should renounce terrorism and stick to politics. But it doesn't seem probable. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How will Israeli society be affected? <P>

<b>Arens:</b> The worst outcome is the rift within Israeli society, which was foreseeable and which will take a long time to heal. The settlers and their supporters are not an insignificant minority and by any reckoning they're a high quality part of society. The IDF has always been a symbol of unity, but now it's using soldiers in compulsory military service to confront other Israeli citizens. This is not good for the image of the IDF in the eyes of Israelis, and not good for solidarity within Israeli society.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How do you address the argument that disengagement is vital from the demographic standpoint and that it is important to reduce the extent of Israeli occupation? <P>

<b>Arens:</b> In my opinion, the arguments for disengagement are a pack of untruths, if not outright lies. This is not disengagement but rather a unilateral withdrawal. Israel will never be able to totally disengage from Palestinians. I don't need to tell you that the day after disengagement the demographics of the state of Israel won't change by a single percentile. We're not really ending occupation in Gaza. We ended that 11 years ago. I advocated that in 1992 as minister of defense. Though Palestinian life is not normalized and Netzarim and Kfar Darom are indeed located right in the middle of Gaza, Gush Qatif is separate: it and the northern Gaza settlements don't cause us to us rule Gaza. Even in Judea and Samaria we had stopped ruling the cities until Operation Defensive Shield in 2002.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> To sum up, how do you see the coming year beyond disengagement?<P>

<b>Arens:</b> It all depends what happens with terrorism. It is accepted by almost everybody that when terrorism is rampant there can be no negotiating front. If terror remains at its present low level I would advocate negotiations, not another unilateral step. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you envision the Bush administration or the international community actively involved in such an initiative? 
<P>
<b>Arens:</b> I don't accept the premise that we need heavy US involvement, and I don't foresee this administration stepping in to pressure one side or the other. That was not the case in the past and I don't see it happening in the future.- <i>Published 15/8/2005 (c) bitterlemons.org<P>
