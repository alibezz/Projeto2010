The Almighty is greater (Allahu Akbar), hence in his presence we must subdue our heart and acknowledge that our thoughts cannot comprehend his ways. We must open our eyes and see things that we could not contemplate, just as G-d opened the eyes of Hagar and she saw the well of springing water. Where did the Almighty take the water from? From a place we would not have thought of: from the heart of the parched desert.
<p>
We must also open our heart and our eyes to the unilateral disengagement. Perhaps G-d will open our eyes and we'll find there a hope for peace. And where will peace emerge there? G-d willing, from the place we would not have thought of: from the difficult problem of the synagogues.
<p>
We have seen that as soon as the decision was made on the political issue of the land in Gaza, the religious issue of the synagogues arose. The moment the Jewish residents of the Gaza Strip were removed, the rabbis began to be concerned about the remaining synagogues. The demand to sanctify the synagogues unites the most important rabbis of all political persuasions: Zionists and non-Zionists, those who resolutely opposed disengagement as well as those who supported it and even participated in the government that carried it out. For the problem of the synagogues is perceived by the rabbis as a religious rather than a political issue. Traditional Jewish law (halacha) determines that synagogues retain their sanctity when they are deserted and even when they have been damaged. G-d forbids destroying synagogues, because these houses are reserved for worshiping G-d, blessed be he. (In terms of finding a solution to this issue it is important to note from the outset that the same halachic prohibition applies to mosques, since according to halacha they are special houses for the worship of G-d, blessed be he.)
<p>
Initially the entire government of Israel opposed the rabbis' demand. But after President Moshe Katzav expressed his view that on a religious issue like the fate of the synagogues the rabbis' view must be taken into account, the government too adopted a different approach and, at the last minute, turned the synagogues over to the Palestinians together with the land.
<p>
What will the Palestinians do with the synagogues? Having dealt at length with the issue, I am fully aware that the Palestinian leadership resolutely opposed taking possession of the synagogues, and I understand its reasons. But sometimes the Almighty finds good in places we never contemplated. Perhaps G-d will open our eyes and the Palestinian government will discover that it can profit greatly from having the synagogues forced upon it.
<p>
At present, in order to prevent any further destruction of the synagogues, the most important rabbis in Israel are appealing to the Palestinian government. For years, the Almighty, blessed be he, caused me to think that one of the important reasons why so many efforts to bring peace have failed is that the religious leaders on both sides have barely participated in the process. The pioneers of peace--those truly possessed by the vision of peace--are usually secular; hence peace plans usually lack sufficient sensitivity to the world of religion. The religious publics among both peoples have generally been left out of peace efforts, and in any case usually oppose them. Yet the views of the religious leaderships have a critical influence on the success of peace efforts.
<p>
The synagogues issue could, G-d willing, provide an opening to ties between our two peoples. In response to a Palestinian proposal, I recently sent a letter in the name of the rabbis to the president and prime minister of Palestine and the minister of interior (security), in which the rabbis requested to meet with the Palestinians to discuss the fate of the synagogues under their control. The Palestinian leadership, aware of the damage inflicted on Palestinian honor by the pictures of burning synagogues being broadcast worldwide, can now replace those pictures with images of the honorable reception awarded to a rabbinical delegation. 
<p>
What can the Palestinians do with the synagogues? A proposal that I am currently discussing with religious and political leaders is for the religious leadership of both peoples to immediately establish a joint committee to maintain the abandoned synagogues that are under Palestinian rule--as well as the abandoned mosques under Israeli rule. Such a committee not only offers a way for the Palestinian government to show that it is concerned over a painful issue for many Muslims: the integrity of abandoned mosques in Israel. It would also be an important step forward on an issue that for years has in my view been decisive for the fate of contemporary Jewish-Arab peace: mutual respect between religions and cultures.
<p>
There is no peace without respect. Peace is not only a political arrangement. Political peace requires a religious and cultural basis. The Oslo agreements collapsed primarily because the decision to end armed struggle did not enjoy sufficient support among the Palestinian masses. Establishing a joint committee made up of the important religious leaders of the two peoples could, G-d willing, be a decisive step toward providing legitimacy in the consciousness of both peoples for the possibility of peace based on mutual respect for one another's culture.
<p>
Years before the 9/11 terror attack on the United States and its response in Afghanistan and Iraq, it was clear that mutual respect between Islamic and western culture is a precondition for world peace. Here our two little peoples, Israelis and Palestinians, can, G-d willing, fill an important function. They can show the entire world how Islam and the West can respect one another. If Israelis and Palestinians succeed in building Jerusalem/al-Quds as their joint capital, in which the West and Islam show respect for one another, then Jerusalem/al-Quds can, G-d willing, become the peace capital of the world.
<p>
The beginning, G-d willing, can take the form of maintaining the integrity of the abandoned mosques under Israeli control and the abandoned synagogues under Palestinian rule. There are huge obstacles in the way, but the Almighty is greater, Allahu Akbar, and he can do far more than we can imagine if only we submit to him.<i>- Published 19/9/2005 &copy; bitterlemons.org<p></i>
