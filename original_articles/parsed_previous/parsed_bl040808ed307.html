an interview with George Giacaman
</table><p>
  


<b>bitterlemons:</b> It looks like Ehud Olmert's time as prime minister is coming to an end. How will this affect the peace process?
<p>
<b>Giacaman:</b> Hardly anyone seems optimistic that a peace agreement can be reached by the end of year. Now the resignation of Olmert will be an added complication because even if Tzipi Livni takes over and carries on negotiations, the original lack of optimism will remain. 
<p>
I think maybe they are working--at least the Palestinian side has insisted on a written statement--on writing down where they have reached so far, so that in the future they won't have to start all over again.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> But will that oblige anyone, some one like Binyamin Netanyahu for example?
<p>
<b>Giacaman:</b> There's a good chance that it won't, but at least the Palestinian side can argue that it was negotiating with a government. It is generally understood that governments are responsible for affairs of state and subsequent governments are thus responsible for the decisions of previous administrations. Germany, for example, still continues to pay reparations to victims of the Nazis. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> You talk about the original lack of optimism. What do you mean?
<p>
<b>Giacaman:</b> Since the beginning of the Annapolis process there have been plenty of commentators--Israeli, Palestinian, Arab, US and European--who are not optimistic. This pessimism appears to have been borne out by subsequent events, unless there is a last minute surprise, which I think one should not completely rule out no matter how bleak the picture looks now. Still, hardly anyone seems optimistic, including President Mahmoud Abbas.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> You say one shouldn't rule out a breakthrough. Why?
<p>
<b>Giacaman:</b> There has been a back channel and no one knows what that back channel has achieved. It's a very odd situation where it is public knowledge that there are secret negotiations, but very few people know about the content of those negotiations. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How might this situation affect domestic Palestinian affairs?
<p>
<b>Giacaman:</b> Some issues are separate, some are connected. Had there been convincing progress in negotiations from the perspective of the Palestinian public, it would have strengthened the position of the Palestinian Authority vis-a-vis Hamas. At the same time, if a whole year of negotiations elapses with no result it will be perceived as a failure, and this will weaken the PA and at the same time, to some degree, strengthen the credibility of Hamas.-<i> Published 4/8/2008 &copy; bitterlemons-international.org
