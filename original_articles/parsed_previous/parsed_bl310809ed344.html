<b>bitterlemons:</b> How important, in hindsight, was the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip?
<p>
<b>Sarraj:</b> It was a very significant step in the history of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, very serious indeed for us. It was well planned and prepared over a long time. It came about once the Israeli military establishment headed by Ariel Sharon decided to take the option, as one of his aides, Dov Weisglass, said at the time, to put the peace process in formaldehyde. 
<p>
Israel wanted to stop negotiating borders, stop negotiating Jerusalem and, something not made explicit at the time, get rid of the demographic bulk of Palestinians in Gaza as well as separate Gaza from the West Bank. This was all a long time before Hamas took control.
<p>
This is not a new Israeli plan. As far back as the late 1980s, Israeli strategists presented six scenarios for a Palestinian state. One of them was a unilateral withdrawal from Gaza. This scenario was exactly what Sharon ended up choosing. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How important is the fact that the withdrawal was unilateral?
<p>
<b>Sarraj:</b> Israel never wanted seriously to negotiate peace and has always evaded such negotiations. A unilateral withdrawal was meant to send the signal that Israel had no partner to negotiate peace, something that significantly weakened Mahmoud Abbas. 
<p>
And this Israeli unilateralism was a watershed. It was a strategic decision to separate Gaza from the West Bank and bring back a situation that existed before 1967. It was an attempt at reversing the strategy that had been pursued by Yitzhak Rabin.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> You say the withdrawal weakened Abbas. Not more than six months later, Hamas won parliamentary elections. How important was the withdrawal in this respect?
<p>
<b>Sarraj:</b> There were other important factors, more significant than the withdrawal. These include allegations of corruption and mismanagement by Fateh, and certainly the failure of the peace process. There were also internal problems within Fateh itself. These were all more significant than the withdrawal. 
<p>
The unilateral withdrawal, however, put the first nail into the coffin of hopes for an independent Palestinian state by separating Gaza from the West Bank. Sharon wanted a complete separation of Gaza from the West Bank by 2008. And now Salam Fayyad [the PA prime minister] is presenting a plan for building a state in the West Bank with no mention of Gaza. Palestinians are good at playing the roles Israel assigns them.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Has Gaza been irreparably separated from the West Bank?
<p>
<b>Sarraj:</b> I hope not. It seems Israel is determined to keep Gaza separate and not allow negotiations to lead to an independent Palestinian state. It is clear to me that Israel wants the end result to be some kind of entity on what's left of the West Bank, after settlements and Jerusalem are taken away, with Gaza pushed toward Egypt.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Will Egypt play this part?
<p>
<b>Sarraj:</b> Egypt has little choice. It is under US pressure and, for its own security reasons, it has to control the border with Gaza.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What are Egypt's options then? 
<p>
<b>Sarraj:</b> Cairo cannot lift the siege from its side as long as Israel continues its siege. But Fateh and Hamas are not helping the Egyptians. Cairo is desperate for a Palestinian [reconciliation] agreement so Egypt can push for an opening of all crossings into Gaza, including Rafah. The Shalit negotiations may be the beginning of such a domino effect.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> If Palestinian factions are aware of this Egyptian position, shouldn't that act as motivation for them to reconcile?
<p>
<b>Sarraj:</b> It should if they are thinking of the interests of Palestine as a whole, not their own narrow interests. But they are not.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Did the withdrawal bring anything positive for Gaza?
<p>
<b>Sarraj:</b> Of course it is positive that there are no settlements now in Gaza. But Gaza remains under occupation. In the long term, the most important thing is that the siege on Gaza, the separation of Gaza from the West Bank, and the settlements and wall in the West Bank are opening the eyes of the world to the real nature of Israel's racist, apartheid policy vis-a-vis the Palestinians. This may lead to a concerted effort at starting a serious boycott and sanctions campaign against Israel to rescue Israel from itself. This is the only way to make Israel change.- <i>Published 31/8/2009 &copy; bitterlemons.org</I>
