One year after the death of Yasser Arafat, the biggest surprise is that nearly no one misses him. When Arafat vanished without collective grief and the transfer of power took place with dignity, it appeared as if all Abu Mazen (President Mahmoud Abbas) had to do was keep his promise: one authority, one law, one gun. But with the passage of time, it emerged that only Arafat knew the operative formula that would enable the gathering of all the factions, all those particles, into agreement on something.
<p>
Arafat had a design for exercising control: divide and rule, fragment forces, all against all and, in the end, all dependent on him. The day Arafat departed so did the formula, and Palestine's diverse actors began to act without direction or purpose. Even had Arafat tried, in his dying moments, to whisper the secret code, it would have turned out that only the man seen as the father of the nation, the symbol of national struggle, the historic leader, the one married to the revolution--only he could rule on the basis of the existing system.
<p>
The problem was that after the outbreak of the intifada he did not want to, or perhaps believed mistakenly that he could not, use his formula to maneuver the Palestinian system toward a hudna (ceasefire), non-violent resistance, and dialogue with the Americans and through them with Israel.
<p>
Historically, Arafat was without doubt an impressive leader. Yet in the post-Oslo era he lacked the facility to change his fatigues for a statesman's business suit. He did not know how to make the transformation from revolutionary to state-builder, from a leader nourished by conflict to one who generates stability and aspires to end conflict. Ironically, it is Abu Mazen who displays all those character traits that Arafat lacked. Beyond the political integrity and pragmatism that he projects, which were nearly non-existent in his predecessor, Abu Mazen was over the years the man who tried to persuade Arafat, unsuccessfully, to concentrate on state-building. And it was he who took the lead from the outset after the Oslo accords to move ahead as fast as possible toward a final status agreement that would bring peace to Israel and an end to the historic conflict.
<p>
A year has passed, and what remains from Arafat is fauda, chaos. Security has been "privatized" in favor of armed and violent gangs that rule city centers and refugee camps; the security services are more fragmented than ever; Hamas is gathering strength at the expense of the inactive Palestinian Authority; government offices barely function; law enforcement is in a state of collapse; and the Fateh movement is destroying itself from within in superfluous power struggles. In other words, there is chaos at every corner, no collective responsibility, and Abu Mazen is unable to lead, rule, or deliver on any of his promises to the public. One year later, and the hoped-for changes are not happening.
<p>
True, Israel has made its own very significant "contribution". Throughout the past year Israel did almost nothing to strengthen the PA or to empower the new rais. The historic move to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, dismantle the settlements and redeploy along the 1967 border was also made without coordination and without enabling Abu Mazen to score a single political point. Thus, too, the ongoing building of outposts, the route of the fence, the system of assassinations, the light finger on the trigger, and a long list of daily injustices of occupation. But it would be a grave mistake to blame only Israel for everything and thereby to ignore the insight that there must be a Palestinian awakening: a general house-cleaning that stops the current huge decline--a decline that is liable to lead to disintegration from within and that will be hard to avoid even if the occupation disappears.
<p>
Ariel Sharon is the principal beneficiary of the situation within the PA and the status of Abu Mazen. He wants them weak. He does not want to find a partner for the peace of the brave of the sort launched by Arafat and Rabin. On the other hand, he is not interested in the collapse of the PA and the fall of Abu Mazen. The current situation is ideal for Sharon. The "there is no partner" mantra gathers momentum when the chaos in the PA is the principal characteristic of daily life. That the occupation contributes, the assassinations help, and most of the Palestinian public wants a decent solution and compromise with Israel--does not interest him. Thus does the Palestinian public play into Sharon's hands; he can always find a good excuse for not moving ahead with the roadmap and for continuing to recycle the lie, invented by Ehud Barak, that there is nothing to talk about because there is no one to talk to.
<p>
But the good news is that Abu Mazen--this decent person who really believes in building a Palestinian nation and society and really believes there is no better way for both sides than the path of peace--is still holding on, and is doing all in his power to stabilize the situation. Perhaps the Palestinian parliamentary elections in January 2006 will launch a new departure that will put paid to the Arafat legacy. Perhaps the opening of Gaza to Egypt and the inauguration of efficient commercial transit points with Israel will rejuvenate the Gazan economy and generate a new momentum. And perhaps the election of a new leader for the Labor Party will reestablish Israel as a true partner for peace--one that strengthens its Palestinian partner out of a sense of long term responsibility.-<i> Published 14/11/2005 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
