
an interview with Tzipi Livni

</table>
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What is your impression of the election process that brought Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) to the Palestinian premiership?
<p>
<b>Livni:</b> The process was disappointing in some ways, because of Arafat's influence and his unwillingness to accept procedures that are supposed to affect the mode of the war against terrorism. But the outcome is positive from the standpoint of anyone who wants to arrive at a political peace process.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What is the government of Israel demanding of Abu Mazen and his government?
<p>
<b>Livni:</b> What has happened within the Palestinian leadership was intended primarily to advance those who recognize that it is Palestinian society that requires a war against terrorism. Therefore, I don't want to address this from the Israeli standpoint. This is first of all a Palestinian interest. Palestinian society has been damaged by terrorism at its deepest levels. So there is both a Palestinian internal interest and a government interest.
<p>
From Israel's standpoint, in order to move forward the infrastructure of terrorism must be eliminated. If any Israeli, right or left, wants to advance a peace process, he will undoubtedly not do so if confronted by a terrorist state. Hence both sides have an interest.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What is your approach to the <i>hudna</i> idea, a ceasefire among the Palestinian factions, as a solution to terrorism?
<p>
<b>Livni:</b> This is a very disturbing idea. I fear this will not be sufficient, will not provide the right road to the beginning of a process, because the [terrorist] organizations will simply acquire more weapons and prepare for the next round. A <i>hudna</i> will provide imaginary external quiet that will arouse deep fears among Israelis.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Will the Americans suffice with a <i>hudna</i>?
<p>
<b>Livni:</b> The Americans aren't playing games here. We saw that in Iraq.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Can you address the amendments that Israel is asking for in the <a href="http://www.bitterlemons.org/docs/roadmap3.html">roadmap</a>--the additional demands upon the Palestinians?
<p>
<b>Livni:</b> One issue regarding which I have taken the lead is substantive. President Bush is leading a solution of two states for the two peoples. Therefore the historical deal will involve the creation of a Palestinian state in the sense that this encompasses an arrangement for the [1948 Palestinian] refugees. Accordingly, the translation of <a href="http://www.bitterlemons.org/docs/bush.html">Bush's speech</a> [of June 24, 2002] into the roadmap is defective. Hence I demanded that the discussion of a Palestinian state be held simultaneously with the discussion of the refugee problem.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Perhaps your argument is with phase II of the roadmap. After all, it moves up the discussion of one final status issue, a Palestinian state, but delays the other final status issues to phase III.
<p>
<b>Livni:</b> Phase II as it stands is problematic, since it advances one topic of final status. Therefore we must move the discussion of the refugees to the same phase. This is the only way we can accept the roadmap.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Perhaps the solution is simply to skip this problematic phase II. . . ?
<p>
<b>Livni:</b> If we skip phase II this will return us to August 2000.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Reportedly, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon suggested that the Palestinians agree to define Israel as a Jewish state, perhaps instead of renouncing the right of return at this time.
<p>
<b>Livni:</b> Defining Israel as a Jewish state is not sufficient because this moves the issue to demographics, to a discussion of percentages, and I'm talking about a matter of principle. If the establishment of a Palestinian state does not provide a solution to the Palestinian people, then there is no reason I should agree with it. I propose a solution that moves both sides into the process.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> It's generally understood that Abu Mazen does not forego the right of return at the level of principle.
<p>
<b>Livni:</b> I regret Abu Mazen's position regarding the right of return. There's no point in the process unless we get this amendment.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> And if the US, which opposes any changes in the roadmap, opposes the amendment you propose?
<p>
<b>Livni:</b> If the US opposes the change then I, who want to reach an agreement, won't be able to support the process. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Can you address the other Israeli comments on the roadmap?
<p>
<b>Livni:</b> There were additional amendments, for example regarding the timetable for the process. Obviously the entire concept of phasing was intended to move from one phase to the next in an atmosphere of security. If the timetable is not clearly locked into performance tests, this is insufficient.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Isn't the process in any case likely to break down in phases II and III in view of the clash between the views of Sharon and Abu Mazen?
<p>
<b>Livni:</b> The process itself can be beneficial. If we see that there's security in phase I, and a period of time passes during which we see that the terrorist organizations have been eliminated and the textbooks changed, then our readiness to compromise will also change. That's why phasing may provide a better chance.
