<b>bitterlemons:</b> The Egyptian initiative was apparently needed because a direct bilateral agreement on withdrawal between Israel and the Palestinians was impossible. Why is that?
<P>
<b>Amireh:</b> The Israelis are heading toward consolidating the occupation in the West Bank through the separation fence, settlement expansion, and all kinds of oppression against the Palestinians. We think that this disengagement plan is using the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, planned for March 2005, to impose a kind of engagement in the West Bank through the separation wall. A one-sided solution is being imposed on the Palestinians.
<P>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What do you think of the Egyptian initiative?
<P>
<b>Amireh:</b> The Egyptians themselves say they don't have an initiative, but they are trying to take advantage of the opportunity presented by Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. They would like to help the Palestinians to get control over the areas in the Gaza Strip from which the Israelis are going to withdraw. 
<P>
The Egyptians say they do not wish to market the disengagement plan. The difference between the disengagement plan and withdrawal is that the disengagement plan includes expansion in the West Bank, while the Egyptians aim to help the Palestinians with the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Nobody wants the Gaza Strip, perhaps not even the Palestinians, so Israel is seeking to bargain Gaza for the West Bank. 
<P>
The Palestinian leadership rejects this approach, even though everybody in the world--especially the Israelis and Americans--says the disengagement plan is the first step in implementing the roadmap. We think that on the contrary, it is not a step toward implementing the roadmap; it is an alternative step.
<P>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why do some Fatah members oppose the Egyptian initiative?
<P>
<b>Amireh:</B> They have certain fears about the future Egyptian role in the Gaza Strip. They think maybe the Egyptians want to play a security role in the Gaza Strip. Also there are certain Arabs who oppose the Egyptian initiative, like the Syrians.  Last week, about ten Palestinian organizations in Damascus issued a declaration against the Egyptian initiative. Hamas and Islamic Jihad are opposed, because--I think--they are concerned that the Egyptians are trying to consolidate the role of the Palestinian National Authority, so this does not fit with their interests.
<P>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How likely is it that the PNA and non-PNA factions like Hamas and Islamic Jihad will be able to agree on withdrawal terms?
<P>
<b>Amireh:</b> They don't now. They have opposite positions. The PNA supports the Egyptian plan.
<P>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do they all have to agree in order for the initiative to succeed?
<P>
<b>Amireh:</b> Hamas and Jihad could sabotage the plan, using different means, like military attacks. On the other hand, there is an opportunity to achieve agreement through the internal Palestinian dialogue. We think that there should be concurrence, but now there is not.
