One of the features of Palestinian-Israeli peacemaking attempts has been the division of the process into interim and final stages. The interim stage ranges from a series of confidence-building measures to the establishment of an interim authority with no sovereignty or borders. All the substantial aspects of the conflict are supposed to be negotiated in the final stage, including borders, refugees and Jerusalem. <P>

This approach brings with it two consequences: first, the interim period is reversible, and second, the final stage is open-ended.<P>

It is a widely accepted on the Palestinian side that this interim/final feature is among the structural reasons for the failure so far of the peace process. In fact, at the moment we are witnessing, after more than ten years of this process, a situation that is in all respects worse than it has even been. Palestinians are further from achieving their legitimate objectives of an end to occupation and independence, Israelis are less secure and further from being integrated into the region, and relations between the two on official and non-official levels are at their lowest ebb ever. <P>

When Palestinians analyze why and what went wrong, one of the conclusions is usually related to the structure of the process. It would be more fruitful for the parties to directly negotiate the fundamental aspects of the conflict in a way that would allow different levels of compromise on the different final status components, including the settlements, borders, Jerusalem, security and future relations between the two sides. <P>

Such an approach would not only save time, but would also avoid the temptation to use the interim period to deviate from efforts to negotiate peace by creating realities that promote one side's vision over the other vis-a-vis the final phase. As we have seen, such actions and policies can deepen the mistrust and hostility, rather than build the confidence to proceed. <P>

Of course there is a major risk. Heading directly to final status negotiations would risk the possibility of final disagreement instead of final agreement. In this case, there will be no interim arrangement to fall back on until the situation proves more conducive to further rounds of final negotiations.<P>

But another lesson from the interim/final structure of the peace process experience is the opportunity the interim stage affords the more powerful party, especially when there is a non-neutral broker. Israel, as the powerful party, held all the cards from the outset and used them to disadvantage the other, weaker and less sophisticated, Palestinian side. <P>

Thus the interim reality was perverted by Israel. To give but one example, Israel simply refused, unilaterally, to pursue the stipulated phases of redeployment for its forces from Palestinian territory, especially during Barak's time. Barak decided that redeploying, i.e., withdrawing troops in the interim period as Oslo stipulated, would leave Israel vulnerable to making compromises over issues such as Jerusalem, refugees and settlements. <P>

The US, which monopolized and manipulated the role of sponsor and mediator, unfairly enabled Israel to undermine the interim phase. The obvious example was and continues to be closing its eyes to Israel's continued settlement-building, a clear violation of the peace process. The expansion of illegal Jewish settlements in territories upon which a Palestinian state was supposed to be built was the single most damaging factor to the chances of success for the peace process. <P>

Palestinians, meanwhile, were helpless, but were consistent in warning the US and other members of the international community against this Israeli strategy. <P>

Given the special nature of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and peacemaking experience, the interim/final structure hasn't been a constructive one. If the parties are genuine in wanting to exchange occupied land for comprehensive and lasting peace, dealing directly and upfront with final status issues is the only strategy that remains untried. .- <i>Published 6/11/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
