<b>bitterlemons:</b> The PA is pressuring Israel to coordinate its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Where does Hamas stand on this issue?<P>

<b>Hamed:</b> First of all, Hamas believes the withdrawal from Gaza is a result of the resistance and the attacks against soldiers and settlers in the Gaza Strip. At the same time, the movement is concerned that it will turn out to be a trap for the Palestinian side, if the Palestinian Authority forgets that the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are one geographical unit.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why the PA?<P>

<b>Hamed:</b> The PA says it is ready to coordinate with Israel to facilitate the withdrawal from Gaza and they forget that no one has given any promises that this withdrawal is part of the roadmap. There have been no guarantees from America, Israel or even the Egyptians. Hamas is concerned that the PA will become a victim of a disengagement in which Gaza becomes a big prison and [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon subsequently refuses any negotiations over the West Bank.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> But isn't the reality that Israel will withdraw regardless, and the best way to ensure anything out of this for the Palestinian side is through coordination?<P>

<b>Hamed:</b> But what do we mean by coordination? If Sharon plans the details of everything and then calls the PA simply to ensure the safety of soldiers and settlers from Palestinian attacks during withdrawal, it cannot be counted as coordination in any meaningful way. The PA must know the details of the disengagement, if it is part of the roadmap or the political compromise, or if Sharon is playing his own game. <P>

Hamas has warned several times that the withdrawal may turn out to be a trap for the Palestinian Authority and is aimed at creating a state in Gaza alone, after which there will be no negotiations over the West Bank. Backing up Hamas' argument is the continuing building of the wall in the West Bank, the expansions of the settlements there, and Sharon's insistence that he will not withdraw from the West Bank. <P>

On the other hand, of course, Hamas is not calling for Israel to stay. The withdrawal is a necessity but must be a step toward the ending of the occupation.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What cause of action would Hamas suggest the PA follow?<P>

<b>Hamed:</b> First of all, the PA should not be deceived by any promises made by Israel or the US. Everything must be on paper, all details should be clear, and the Israeli intentions should be properly understood. Also to be understood are the intentions of the US and the EU. Can they fulfill their promises to pressure Israel to continue the peace process, or will they end their efforts at the Gaza station? <P>

Hamas has consistently warned the PA not to be deceived by Israel, and says it should insist on dealing with the West Bank and Gaza Strip as one geographical unit. If this does not happen, if Gaza is separated from the West Bank, it means the destruction of the Palestinian dream. Gaza will become a prison, surrounded by Israeli troops on all sides, and all exports or imports will be under Israeli control. The PA is taking a risk by providing cover for a disengagement without any guarantees that this is part of a political process. It could even see the destruction of the PA, if it thus fails to fulfill Palestinian national aspirations and end the occupation.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What role does Hamas hope third parties will play in this?<P>

<b>Hamed:</b> Hamas doesn't trust the US, which appears to care less for Palestinian rights than it cares for its support of Israel. The US has not done anything about the wall and the expansion of settlements. The EU could play a bigger role in pressuring Israel, but Hamas feels the EU is too weak to really challenge the US to play any significant role in the Middle East. Hamas is very skeptical that the US and the EU are playing any fair role in this.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What single signal would show Hamas that any coordination between the PA and Israel is fruitful.<P>

<b>Hamed:</b> Hamas believes the PA is making a mistake when it agrees to "coordinate" with Israel. Israel only calls the PA when it needs security and protection. Israel has not discussed any political details with the PA and until now there are no political negotiations. The PA should not be a security force for Israeli troops or settlers. The political phase of disengagement must be discussed. The PA should not try to deceive its people that an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza is a big leap forward, because in the absence of a political process it will simply turn Gaza into a big prison.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> In other words, coordination is only positive in the context of political negotiations.<P>

<b>Hamed:</b> Absolutely.- <i>Published 9/5/2005 (c) bitterlemons.org<P>
