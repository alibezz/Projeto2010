an interview with Taher al-Nuno

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Hamas has been in power now for a year since it won elections. In that time, Palestinians are poorer than ever and a civil war is stirring in Gaza. Whom do you blame?<P>

<b>Nuno:</b> In the agreements it signed with the PLO, Israel attempted to link the Palestinian economy with its own in order to keep Palestinians under Israeli control. After the start of the Aqsa Intifada in 2000, Israel imposed a siege and destroyed the Palestinian economy along with its infrastructure. When this current government took power, Israel simply tightened its siege. This government does not carry the responsibility for the siege. Blame must be placed squarely on the shoulders of Israel and on the international community, which is supporting Israel and its occupation at the expense of the occupied Palestinian people. <P>

Regarding the civil war, this is part of what [US Secretary of State] Condoleezza Rice once called "constructive chaos" to oust Hamas after it won elections last year. It complements Israel's intervention on behalf of those who want to overthrow the government. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> The international community, led by the US, has boycotted the government until the government accepts its three conditions. What is unacceptable about these conditions?<P>

<b>Nuno:</b> They are simply unjust. Recognize Israel? Which Israel? Are there any specific borders for this Israel ? What about Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Golan Heights? Does Israel recognize Palestinian rights? All these questions must be answered.<P>

Regarding previous agreements signed with Israel: given that the Israeli side has refused to adhere to them, why should we? Israel has cancelled these agreements by reoccupying the West Bank, besieging Gaza and killing and arresting, on a daily basis, our people. Why should we be committed to agreements that no one respects and that the international community itself is not enforcing? <P>

Finally, the government has condemned violence but it makes a distinction between violence and legitimate resistance. Resisting foreign occupation is the right of any occupied people. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is there a compromise possible? Do you believe that a unity government, for example, is acceptable to the international community?<P>

<b>Nuno:</b> Palestinians must be united to confront and defeat the siege. Both sides can reach a compromise and build an internal front to confront the Israeli occupation and Israeli designs to cancel Palestinian rights.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> In what other way does Hamas and the government believe it can get around the international boycott?<P>

<b>Nuno:</b> Not all the international community boycotts Hamas. We have good relations with Islamic, Arab as well as non-Arab and non-Islamic countries. These are countries that have received us and with whom we maintain continuous contact.<P>

We also maintain contact with European countries and understand from them that they too want to see an end to the isolation imposed upon the government and our people.<P>

It is because of these friends that we have withstood the American-Israeli siege and maintained the struggle for the rights of our people. <P>

But we need everyone's help. The whole world should understand that the key to security and stability in the region is to honor the results of our elections and the rights of the Palestinian people.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> In case the international community refuses any compromise solution or refuses to deal with a unity government, what are the options for the government?<P>

<b>Nuno:</b> We don't expect anything from the international community. But we are still confident that the moral cause will prevail over the non-moral one.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How much contact is there between the government and the Quartet members?<P>

<b>Nuno:</b> We recently sent a letter to the Quartet calling on them to engage in a serious dialogue to achieve security and stability in the region. We hope that the message will find receptive ears.- <i>Published 5/2/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
