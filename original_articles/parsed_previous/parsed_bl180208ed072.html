<b>bitterlemons:</b> There is increasing talk in Israel of a major Israeli military incursion into Gaza. Does Hamas believe such an incursion is likely and what steps is the military wing taking to prepare?<P>

<b>Abu Mohammad:</b> We believe that the Israeli occupation will continue its escalation against the Palestinian people by invading Palestinian cities and areas. But we don't believe Israel will undertake a comprehensive invasion of Gaza.<P>

We also believe that Israel could, in a few hours, reoccupy the Gaza Strip. Israel's real challenge will come after such an occupation. Gaza is the center of resistance and Israel should remember how little it enjoyed occupying the Strip before. In every street and home Israeli soldiers will find death waiting for them. <P>

As for specific tactics I will not go into detail other than that Israel can expect several surprises. In addition, I can confirm that any such major invasion will not end the rocket fire.<P> 

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Israel says that any such incursion will aim to end Hamas control over Gaza. Is this a scenario Hamas fears? Is Hamas capable of withstanding a major Israeli attack?<P>

<b>Abu Mohammad:</b> Israel can't crush Hamas or end its control over Gaza simply because Hamas represents more than half the Palestinian people. Accordingly, crushing Hamas means crushing half the Palestinian people. Also, Hamas is not afraid of the Israelis. In the past, we were under direct Israeli occupation, an occupation Israel eventually fled from in Gaza. Since Hamas' founding, Israel has struck at it again and again, in 1988, 1989, 1992, 1994 and 1996. Today, we hold a majority in parliament and form the government. Every strike at Hamas only makes the movement stronger and increases its solidarity and support from the Arab and Muslim worlds. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Hamas has repeatedly stated that it is ready for a ceasefire (tahdiyeh) with Israel. What conditions would Israel need to adhere to for such a ceasefire to take hold, and is Hamas ready to enforce a ceasefire on all factions?<P>

<b>Abu Mohammad:</b> Our political leadership has stipulated three conditions for a ceasefire. Once Israel accepts them, then we are ready to implement a ceasefire. First, Israel must stop its incursions and arrest campaigns. Second, Israel must end the siege it has imposed on Palestinians. Third, Israel must stop assassinating Palestinian leaders and activists. In case Israel accepts these conditions, all the Palestinian factions will be committed to the ceasefire because these are their conditions as well.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is Hamas willing to negotiate directly with Israel to reach a ceasefire?<P>

<b>Abu Mohammad:</b> As our political leadership has announced, there can be no direct negotiations with Israel though an understanding can be reached through a third party. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> There has been growing criticism from some quarters, including the West Bank PA and Egypt, that the rocket fire from Gaza serves no purpose. What is your response to such criticism? Does the rocket fire not simply offer Israel an excuse to make life even harder for Gazans?<P>

<b>Abu Mohammad:</b> The criticism itself is irresponsible. Those who level the criticism are those who have surrendered their options by surrendering to the occupation and receiving their orders from Israel. There are no rockets in the West Bank, yet hundreds of checkpoints continue to make life there miserable and Israel invades West Bank cities at will, assassinating and arresting people. The rocket fire is simply our resistance to occupation, a reaction to Israeli aggression in defense of our lives. What else should an occupied people do? <P>

And furthermore, why do they keep criticizing our homemade rockets and not mention the Israeli F16s or Apache helicopters? Let the Europeans and the Americans stop arming the Israelis with the weapons they use to kill our children and women.- <i>Published 18/2/2008 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
