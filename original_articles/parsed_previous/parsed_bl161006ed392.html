There is a common tendency to confuse governmental stability (do elected bodies and officials serve a full term, and is the transfer of power regularized) with governmental legitimacy (do the voters and external actors recognize a government's right, or authority, to rule) and effectiveness (to what extent does government, with the means at its disposal, attain its goals). While these three elements are linked, they are not identical. Moreover, the direction of the linkage is muted. For example, does stability ensure effectiveness or vice versa? Is a stable government ipso facto legitimate, or does initial legitimacy enhance the government's stability?<P>

One way or another, there is little doubt that in recent years we haven been witness to a governability crisis in Israel that comprises all three elements: a decline in the effectiveness of the state's institutions, erosion of their legitimacy and a strong sense of uncertainty about the political future. (This, despite the fact that based on objective parameters like length of term of an elected Knesset there is no significant decline.) <P>

We have also witnessed on the Palestinian side an acute crisis of governance. The Palestinian Authority's effectiveness is at an all-time low; the days of the present government seemed numbered virtually since the moment the results of Hamas' election victory were known. Furthermore, many both inside Palestine and beyond question the legitimacy of the Hamas government even though no one denies that it was elected democratically.<P>

Is there a link between the crises of governance on both sides of the conflict and the total absence of progress in political negotiations between them? Here, too, the answer is not as unequivocal as some would argue. Notably, in Israel and on the Palestinian side the very act of entry into negotiations with a veteran enemy caused, by the mid-1990s, not only sharp disagreements at the level of public debate but even rejection of the elected leadership on the part of significant sectors of the public.<P>

Palestinian "refusalist" organizations and Israeli right wing leaders and organizations both behaved this way. In both cases the rejectionists, arguing that the authorized decision-makers had exceeded the moral if not the legal mandate given them by the voter, tried constantly and by every means to challenge their rule.<P>

The Rabin assassination, whose eleventh anniversary will soon be marked, testified more than any other event to the de-legitimization of his government in the eyes of sectors of the Israeli public that opposed Oslo. But it also testified better than any other event to the stability of governance in Israel, insofar as public and governmental order was not violated despite the pain and the trauma. An alternative example is the readiness of both sides of the Israeli political divide to rally round the flag once it became clear that the peace process had collapsed and negotiations had ended. Within less than half a year Ariel Sharon took the national helm with an unprecedented electoral majority; the public then gave him a near free hand to manage the conflict and his political opponents repeatedly failed to unseat him. <P>

Something similar happened to Yasser Arafat on the Palestinian side: the second intifada restored a portion of the luster he had lost while negotiating with Israel. Only a small majority dared to challenge Sharon's and Arafat's legitimacy in the course of the frontal confrontation between them, and their rule was more stable than previously. Paradoxically it is their successors, elected on the promise of a return to Israeli-Palestinian consultation, who suffer from problems of legitimacy and have difficulty stabilizing their governments.<P>

From the start, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) adopted a relatively compromising position toward Israel yet failed to stabilize his rule. Widespread inefficiency and corruption--inherited from his predecessor--fatally eroded his legitimacy. PM Ehud Olmert, too, in his new and moderate incarnation--support for disengagement followed by the convergence initiative--seems to be failing to recruit general legitimization for a government whose effectiveness, judging at least from the public and media reaction, is very low.<P>

Nevertheless, early elections do not at this point appear to reflect the interest of any significant political actor in Israel. The present Knesset could conceivably last for all or nearly all of its statutory electoral term. But only on condition that there is no dramatic move toward renewing talks with the Palestinians, in which case there is a high likelihood that the life of the Olmert government would be considerably shortened thereby ushering in new elections. Such a development would once again bring to the surface all the forces of de-legitimization, reinforced this time by public anger and disappointment with the governmental ineffectiveness that characterized management of the war in Lebanon last summer.- <i>Published 16/10/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
