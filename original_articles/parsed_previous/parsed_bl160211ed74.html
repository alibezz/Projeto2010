an interview with Sufyan Abu Zaida
</table><p>

 



<b>bitterlemons:</b> What consequences will the Israeli elections have for the Palestinians?
<p>
<b>Abu Zaida:</b> You mean the possibility of an extremist rightwing government? 
<p>
First of all, Palestinians, regardless of the results of these elections, are frustrated with the peace process. Since Madrid in 1991, Palestinians have experienced nine Israeli prime ministers, including the next candidate, Binyamin Netanyahu. We tried everything possible in that time and we failed. 
<p>
I'm not saying we failed only because of Israel, but we failed in terms of results. Any government in Israel, whether it is a government of Likud and the extreme right, or a government of Likud, Kadima and Lieberman, will be very restricted in terms of making peace, if not in pursuing a peace process. After all, we've had a process since 1993.
<p>
We have no illusions as Palestinians. We know it will be even more difficult than before. It's not a good outlook.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What do you expect will happen?
<p>
<b>Abu Zaida:</b> Anything is still possible. There could be a unity government. There could be a Likud-led rightwing government. There could be a rotation between Netanyahu and Tzipi Livni. These possibilities are still open. But if there is an extreme rightwing government, which I anticipate, the peace process will become a joke. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Will an extreme rightwing Israeli government not immediately be on a collision course with the new US administration?
<p>
<b>Abu Zaida:</b> It depends on the agenda of the US administration. If [US President Barack] Obama succeeds in getting the US economy under control and has enough time to deal with the Middle East conflict at the top of his agenda, there will be a problem [between Israel and the US].
<p>
But if the US administration remains absorbed by it domestic problems there will be no change. In our experience, our conflict depends on how Washington deals with the situation more than the kind of government in power in Israel. It's very important what happens in Washington.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Mahmoud Abbas has already said he will deal with any Israeli government. But won't this be very difficult if a rightwing government is in place.
<p>
<b>Abu Zaida:</b> I think Palestinians, regardless what kind of government assumes power in Israel, will not continue to play the same game as last year. Palestinians are fed up just with talk and meetings and initiative after initiative. In terms of direct negotiations, I don't think Palestinians will continue playing this game.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What is the alternative?
<p>
<b>Abu Zaida:</b> I think Palestinians will negotiate only if we have specific initiatives. The Palestinian side will support any party that agrees to the Arab peace initiative and will place that initiative as the only one on the table.
<p>
I am not talking about an end to the peace process. But the kind of process we saw with Annapolis and before cannot continue. Palestinians want peace. It is in their and Israel's interest. But Palestinians are not going to continue negotiating with Israel while Israel continues to build and expand settlements, whatever the government in Israel.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Will a harder Palestinian negotiating position ease reconciliation efforts between Fateh and Hamas?
<p>
<b>Abu Zaida:</b> Partly, yes. But only marginally. The problem between Hamas and Fateh is not only a political one. It depends more on regional issues, the position of Iran and Syria, their relations with Hamas, the relations between Egypt and Saudi Arabia on the one hand and Syria and Qatar on the other. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is there a possibility though that we may, uniquely, have two unity governments confronting each other?
<p>
<b>Abu Zaida:</b> You can dream.- Published 16/2/2009 (c) bitterlemons.org
