an interview with Ali Jarbawi

</table><p>
  
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is Tony Blair the right man for the job as the Quartet's Middle East envoy?<P>

<b>Jarbawi:</b> First we have to look at his mission, then we can talk about the person. The mission is more important than whether he is the right person.<P>

There is a problem with the mission. If I understand his mission correctly, in the beginning Blair will work with the Palestinian Authority to upgrade its institutions in order to ready it to become a state. He will help build institutions, improve the economic situation... good governance, in other words.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Which is needed...<P>

<b>Jarbawi:</b> Yes, but I don't think this is the right approach for the Quartet. It has been tried before, by James Wolfensohn and others. But to come and say we have to upgrade the PA so it can become a state is demeaning to Palestinians. Palestinians, after all, are under occupation. <P>

I wouldn't mind this approach if it was a package deal, if it was clear that at one point the occupation would come to an end, a Palestinian state would be established and the Quartet would work with both the Palestinians and Israelis: the Palestinians for good governance and the Israelis to stop what they are actually doing at the moment. <P>

The right approach is to reach an end to the occupation. As it is, Blair could come here for months without even broaching things like the settlement policy, the wall, the killings, the closures in the West Bank and the suffocation of Gaza, all of the things Israel is engaged in. <P>

Palestinians will not look at this approach as a fair approach. It simply does not address the important questions. Even if we have the best institutions, will the occupation end? Will a Palestinian state be established? Where will it be established?<P>

This is the basic problem with the mission. It is demeaning to come to the people under occupation and keep pushing them to perform better as if to get rid of occupation you need to be somewhat more than a human being.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> And Blair as a person?<P>

<b>Jarbawi:</b> Blair was the prime minister for ten years of a major world power. He had influence. During those ten years he was not successful. If he says now that he is for a two-state solution and a Palestinian state, what did he do for the past ten years to make that a reality? He allied himself with US President George W. Bush, he has Iraq on his conscience... he is tainted. He is not going to be looked at as even-handed.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Israeli observers seem quite happy with his appointment.<P>

<b>Jarbawi:</b> Of course. For the past ten years he was biased in line with the US administration.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you see anything positive about his appointment? He is very high profile and some argue that his appointment is an indication of some seriousness.<P>

<b>Jarbawi:</b> He came to this job with a divided Quartet behind him. The Russians were not happy about the appointment and it was the Americans that pushed for it, a thank-you for ten years in office selling their program.<P>

I think you need political will. Even the highest-profile person, if there is no political will on the part of the Americans and Israelis, won't be successful in this job. And as I say, the mission is wrong in the first place. The pressure is all on the Palestinian side. In the end, the envoy will come out saying that he couldn't succeed because of security issues, because the Palestinians are divided, etc. From the beginning there is a landmine in Blair's way. <P>

Also, I'm not sure that Blair being appointed proves any political will on behalf of the Americans. He will try to get money for the Palestinians and upgrade institutions, but in the midst of Palestinian divisions it will be a difficult task, and in the end he will blame the Palestinian side for any failure. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you expect any surprises from Blair? Will he, for example, speak to Hamas?<P>

<b>Jarbawi:</b> No. I think he will base his rejection to do so on the events in Gaza and that the Palestinian president himself will not talk to them. Why should an international envoy speak to a group that the Palestinian president himself won't speak to?<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> But that leaves an irreparable split among Palestinians that even an international envoy won't address, doesn't it? Won't that make the mission meaningless from the outset?<P>

<b>Jarbawi:</b> I don't think Tony Blair is capable or the right person to do so in any case. I don't think he will be welcome to do so or that the Palestinian public will find that necessary. There are others, the Saudis, Egyptians, etc., to mediate.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Some have argued that Blair's appointment is an insult to Palestinians. Do you agree?<P>

<b>Jarbawi:</b> I wouldn't use those words. I don't think he will be welcome or that he is the right person. Iraq is a major issue as is all that has happened to us in his time in office. There is also the British heritage here. Do we think that the British, who created the problem in the first place, are going to solve it? I don't think so.<P>

In addition, he doesn't have enough clout now that he is out of office. And in ten years in office he didn't do much anyway. I think he is coming to the job as a favor from the Americans. I don't think they are serious and I don't think the Israelis are ready to deal seriously with the Palestinians for a two-state solution. Blair will come and go and in the end he will pin the blame for the failure of his mission on the Palestinians.- <i>Published 2/7/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
