<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is Hamas' entry into the political sphere ultimately good for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement?
<p>
<b>Steinberg:</b> There is no alternative to the politicization of Hamas. It cannot change its Islamic values, but it can be driven to strike a balance between adherence to its values and its responsibility and accountability toward Palestinian society as a whole. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How do you view Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' timing and tactics in drawing Hamas into politics? 
<p>
<b>Steinberg:</b> The main factor is not Abbas, but public opinion. The fact that Hamas is compelled to pay attention to the necessities of society is the main factor in bringing Hamas into the political field. This is more of a constraint than an advantage for Hamas. The ideal situation for Hamas would have been for most of Palestinian society to accept its ultimate values, but the fact that society is tired, worried and yearning for a kind of time out from the intifada compels Hamas to enter the political arena now. 
<p>
Hamas would not have volunteered to pragmatize its attitude. Politicization is the only way that Hamas can be changed. Provided the Palestinian Authority headed by Abbas and Fateh are leading this process, Hamas can be contained. But as things stand today, Hamas seems to be leading the process; Hamas is threatening to contain the PA and Abbas.
<p>
Extrapolating from the present point in time, Hamas I believe would gain between 30 and 50 percent in the elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council in July. Fateh is in total disarray and is searching for its lost identity. It is sufficient to indicate that from 1989 the Fateh Congress hasn't convened, and some of its members have passed away. Today in the eyes of most of the population Fateh is identified with corruption and the dis-functionality of the PA, whereas Hamas is considered clean by comparison. I accept the findings of recent polls by Khalil Shikaki and al-Najah: on the one hand people want a political process headed by Abbas, as was indicated in the presidential elections. But on the other hand, people want clean stables, the end of corruption, and personal security, and these are connected with Hamas.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What should Abbas do to lead the process? What should Israel do to help?
<p>
<b>Steinberg:</b> Not only Israel but the US and the EU; this is an across-the-board situation. First of all, internally, every passing hour is critical. Fateh has to reorganize before the elections. It has to recognize the problem and then address it. It is pitiful that the Fateh General Congress is going to be convened only in August in the wake of the elections and the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. Fateh can change that timetable. 
<p>
Secondly, the Palestinian population needs a broader political context. It must feel that the disengagement will not be both the beginning and the end, because if it is the end this signifies in its eyes that the West Bank will continue to be occupied. It must be assured that disengagement is not an expedient way for Israel to continue to occupy the West Bank. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you expect PM Sharon to take this step?
<p>
<b>Steinberg:</b> Ideally, Israel would devise a plan that specifies the main principles for an overall settlement and indicates the end result of the process, but I don't expect it to. So the task can be done by making concrete the general guidelines of the roadmap regarding final status and specifying an ironclad timetable and interim aims. 
<p>
Further, Israel must understand that insisting that Abbas dismantle the Hamas terrorist infrastructure before the July elections will weaken Abbas and strengthen Hamas. Only after the elections, and assuming Abbas can still lead, should Israel make that demand. For Palestinians, complying with the roadmap timetable [on this issue] means that Israel is trying to drive the PA into a civil war. With the Cairo announcement the Palestinians decided to avoid a civil war, and this is the logic of Palestinian political behavior now.
<p>
Israel has to update its understanding of the roadmap and look at these demands for dismantling the terrorist infrastructure not as a precondition but as a process; look at it less legally and more politically. Israel also has to change its position regarding the roadmap demand to establish a state with provisional borders, because this is understood by the Palestinians as a demand to paralyze the situation. To summarize, the Palestinians must feel that there is a light at the end of this tunnel in order for Abbas to lead the process of politicization of Hamas, rather than Hamas leading the process. For Hamas, politicization is only a means, a maneuver.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> If it's only a maneuver, why should Fateh, or for that matter Israel or the US, be interested in the politicization of Hamas?
<p>
<b>Steinberg:</b> Because Hamas is bowing to constraints. You can't liquidate Hamas. It is not a sect. It is a very popular movement. It has a deep and broad societal base. The only way to neutralize Hamas is to create a "positive" tension between its ultimate values and its responsibilities.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How does this fit into the broader context of Arab Islamist movements?
<p>
<b>Steinberg:</b> The main paradox is that Hamas, Hizballah, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, indeed most fundamentalist movements are, in contrast to al-Qaeda, part and parcel of society, and are eager to exploit the process of democratization. But here we have to differentiate between the medium and the message. They adopt the medium of democracy but not the message of democracy because they want an Islamic regime, or democracy according to Islam, which is more a kind of "shuracracy" (shura = consultation). This is far from the values of western democracy. The Islamists have taken note of the American emphasis on democratization and intend to exploit it to reach their goals, and legitimize their objectives regarding the conflict with Israel. Hamas wants to remove the stigma of being a terrorist organization.
<p>
And yet we all have an interest in letting this happen as long as we can lead it. We don't have an interest if Hamas leads. The main issue is, who is dominant?
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> You mentioned the Cairo announcement of March 17, 2005. How does it fit into this picture?
<p>
<b>Steinberg:</b> The negative aspect of politicization is ingrained in the Cairo announcement, which does not include recognition of Israel and emphasizes the guaranteed right of return of the refugees to their homes and possessions. This means the end of Israel. The other clauses deal with the integration of Hamas into the democratic process. When we compare these phrases about the refugees with those used in recent years by Abbas, or by the recent Arab League summit in Algiers which spoke about "solving the problem of the Palestinian refugees in a just and agreed form and according to UNGA Resolution 194" (, i.e., the March 2002 Beirut summit formula), we see a world of difference. 
<p>
In order to buy a "lull" Abbas has, under the auspices of the Egyptians, accepted the political demands of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. In return for integrating Hamas into Palestinian politics, Abbas has integrated the movement's political approach. He did so in Cairo under extreme duress; this is not his real position. This must cause us concern.<i>- Published 4/4/2005 (c) bitterlemons.org</i><p>
