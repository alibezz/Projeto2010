an interview with Abu Obeidah

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Khalid Meshaal and the Izzedin Qassam Brigades both rejected the recent US benchmarks scheme to ease restrictions on Palestinian movement in return for an end to rocket fire from the Gaza Strip. Why?<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> It's not only Khalid Meshaal and Hamas, it is all the Palestinian people including the DFLP, the PFLP, even Mustapha Barghouti's al-Mubadarah. The plan is rejected because it is first of all a security plan that aims at ending the Palestinian resistance. As we also now know, another aim of the plan is to relieve the European force at the Rafah Crossing. But what Palestinians need is a comprehensive political plan based on restoring the rights of the Palestinian people. What sense does it make that in exchange for some checkpoints, they want us to end the resistance? <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> But the Hamas-led Palestinian government took a much more compromising position. Is there a division within Hamas over this issue, and if not, do Hamas government ministers properly represent the Hamas movement? <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> There are no divisions, but there is a separation between the government and the movement. The Hamas minsters represent Hamas in the government. They are in the business of government. Any position taken by the government does not necessarily represent the political position of the movement.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What could be added to the benchmarks plan to make it more acceptable to the wider Hamas movement? <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> We really do not need any more plans. We have the roadmap, the Tenet principles and now this plan, and they all show the same features, I think they share seven items in common. These are unrealistic security plans that do not address the central issue of solving the conflict by restoring Palestinian rights and ending Palestinian suffering. We don't want to add to this plan. We want a serious, logical political plan, not another security plan.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How large a problem do the Israeli-enforced restrictions on Palestinian movement of people and goods pose for chances of economic growth and, with this in mind, how important is it to have restrictions eased?<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> The suffering as a result of the restrictions on movement is huge. It has debilitated the lives of Palestinians. There is no import, no export and no movement. Life is almost paralyzed. There is no economy, no industry, the agriculture sector is suffering and every day we are losing. <P>

But the Palestinians are not fighting just to open two checkpoints near Jenin or Nablus and then forget about their basic rights. The Palestinians have been suffering and resisting for a long time to get their independence, restore their lands and achieve the basic rights that all Palestinians have reached consensus on. This plan came only to save an Israeli government that is not able to end the rockets or the Palestinian resistance. And with the current turmoil in Israeli political circles, the Israeli government is not able to deliver on any promises anyway. President Mahmoud Abbas and [Chief Negotiator] Saeb Erekat have met [Israeli Prime Minister] Ehud Olmert several times and received repeated promises to ease the restrictions on movement, but nothing has happened. <P>

Palestinian rights are more important than dismantling some checkpoints. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> To what extent do the US proposals to strengthen security forces loyal to President Abbas play a role in Hamas' position?<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> The aim of the Americans in supporting forces loyal to Abbas is to create civil strife. Washington wants the presidential guard to confront the Palestinian resistance that is headed by Hamas. Hamas is the main backbone of the resistance. Once Hamas is stopped, the resistance will end. So by strengthening the presidential guard now, the Americans will one day ask them to confront the Palestinian resistance in return. If the US is interested in supporting the Palestinians, why doesn't it help reform the security apparatuses to fight the security chaos? Why not rebuild security institutions instead of only supporting Abbas? Today the Americans will give them money and weapons and tomorrow they will ask them to pay their due and fight the Palestinian resistance headed by Hamas.- <i>Published 14/5/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
