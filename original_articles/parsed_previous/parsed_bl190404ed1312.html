
a conversation with Abdel Aziz Rantisi, one day before his assassination

</table>
<p>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> If it is said that Palestinians and Israelis are engaged in a war, how then will Palestinians know that they have achieved victory?
<p>
<b>Rantisi:</b> We, the Palestinians, have been engaged in a war that the Zionists have imposed upon us ever since 1948 when they left their countries to occupy ours--from that time, they imposed the war on themselves. 
<p>
By their crime of occupying Palestine, they have caused and created suffering for Palestinians for 56 years. In those years, they slaughtered dozens of thousands of Palestinians aggressively and unjustly, and exiled millions of them from their original lands and properties. The exiled are still looking forward to returning to their lands, cities, villages and houses. The Zionists also imprisoned dozens of thousands of Palestinians; 7,000 of them remain imprisoned today. 
<p>
The Zionists continue destroying our lives for no reason but that we demand our legitimate rights and because we fight to put an end to the tragedy and multi-faceted suffering of our people. Therefore, we think that if the suffering of the Palestinians stops we have achieved victory.      
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Are there different levels of victory, or will only a complete victory be enough?
<p>
<b>Rantisi:</b> Of course there are different levels of victory, whereas sometimes you can win by executing a plan to push Israeli tanks away as they invade any area in our country--because at that time, you would protect our children from being slaughtered by the Zionists. Accordingly, that is a victory. 
<p>
Also, when we force the enemy to leave any piece of our land without giving up any of our legitimate rights as a price for that, we consider this victory. 
<p>
We might also win a round of confrontation or win the media war, thus producing a victory in this expanding war. All of the things I have mentioned are partial, field or periodic victories, but the perfect and complete victory that Palestinians seek is that which can put an end to their suffering, and achieved by regaining all of their comprehensive and complete stolen rights. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How does Islam define victory and is this important in the Palestinian context?
<p>
<b>Rantisi:</b> In Islam, there is no specific definition of victory. Muslims’ concept of victory is the same as others’. How did the French understand it when the Nazis occupied their lands? Or the Algerians, when the French occupied their lands?  The Vietnamese? Or even the Americans themselves?
<p>
All of [these people] are still celebrating the anniversary of the date that they pushed back the invaders or occupiers of their lands and liberated their lands, accordingly ridding themselves of the slavery and humiliation practiced by their occupiers. We as Muslims taste victory the same way they did. 
<p>
Therefore, I don’t think that there is any misunderstanding between the Palestinian factions, national or Islamic, about the definition of victory; we all have the same concept of victory. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Has the Palestinian definition of victory changed in the last 50 years?
<p>
<b>Rantisi:</b> I think that the majority of Palestinians have the same concept and definition of victory from 50 years ago, otherwise they would have accepted all what has been offered them from 1948 until today. [By this], I mean solutions that detract from their rights and international resolutions, peace initiatives or signed agreements. 
<p>
Some might say that the Palestinians have missed many opportunities, but the fact is that they rejected defeat. Or we might say that they were and are still seeking victory.
<p>
It is obvious that Palestinians still want and insist on regaining their comprehensive and complete rights. They have consciously refused any solution that detracts from their national and legitimate rights. The Palestinians also have defended this decision strongly and paid a precious price for that. [They have] sacrificed and are still sacrificing because Palestinians understand that victory means liberating the entire land.      
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is it possible that Palestinians might win the battle with Israel but lose the battle within their own society?
<p>
<b>Rantisi:</b> I don’t think it is possible, because Palestinians cannot win the battle with the enemy unless they are able to win it within their society after defeating the enemy. 
<p>
Look at the deep significance of verses 40 and 41 from Surat al Hajj (which is Sura 22 in the Holy Quran). In this verse, Allah says that those who win rule themselves after they defeat their enemy, because the people that are controlled by various groups that fight each other as they fight the enemy cannot achieve victory. And if one day any one people achieves victory, it will be due to their national triumph. If they were unified during the battle, then they will be able to protect and maintain their unity after achieving victory. Allah said this in his Holy Quran, Surat al Anfal verse 46 and Surat al Assaf, verse 4. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you believe that you will see victory in your lifetime?
<p>
<b>Rantisi:</b> I hope so, but I don’t know when I will die, therefore, I can’t be certain that I will see it, or that I will not. 
<p>
But I want to remind you that the enemy's might does not distance or prevent the possibility of achieving victory. So many unjust countries have collapsed while at their strongest. This is what happened to Germany, to the former Soviet Union. It would not be strange for the Zionist entity and the United States of America to collapse while they are strong.
<p>
I think that the strong will of Palestinian youth is mightier than that of the Zionist soldier by thousands of times. The battle itself has never been one only of weapons because if that were so, the Zionists would have conquered the Palestinian people by practicing their various kinds of destruction and terror against the Palestinians. If that were the case, [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon would have been able to destroy the intifada and the Palestinian resistance in 100 days, as he promised.

Abdel Aziz Rantisi gave this interview as the political leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It was to be his last interview with the press. One day later, he and his bodyguard and driver were killed by an Israeli missile attack on his car. Rantisi was named the head of Hamas in Gaza in late March, after the group's spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was also killed in an Israeli missile strike.
