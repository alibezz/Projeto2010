            <P><B>bitterlemons:</B> What did you see in your recent trip to Iraq 
            that evoked for you similarities or differences with Palestine? 
            <P><B>Atallah:</B> We were traveling between Baghdad and al Halla 
            and we had to find a bypass road to avoid an area that had been 
            closed by the Americans. We were stuck for more than one hour, and I 
            thought--I even wrote it down--that I didn't see any difference 
            between what was happening here and in Palestine. 
            <P>This put me in the psychological situation of being at home. At 
            times I was frightened, not because the Americans were there, but 
            because I was thinking that they were Israeli soldiers--that 
            impression was living inside of me. 
            <P>There were checkpoints and bypass roads and requests for IDs. But 
            here in Palestine, [the Israelis] are more hi-tech. When you get to 
            a checkpoint, they easily record your ID number and check the 
            computer to see if you are wanted. In Baghdad, the Americans don't 
            have such things. They are a new occupation. 
            <P>Another issue that reminded me of home was the cement walls. 
            <P><B>bitterlemons:</B> The army is building walls? 
            <P><B>Atallah:</B> The walls are closing roads, cutting off 
            entrances to military camps and hotels and ministries, or the way to 
            the airport from Baghdad. Of course, these are not dividing the 
            country, but it does make life difficult. 
            <P><B>bitterlemons:</B> From a political standpoint, what are the 
            comparisons that can be made? 
            <P><B>Atallah:</B> I heard from Iraqi intellectuals about how the 
            Iraqi and Palestinian authorities are similar, in that they are 
            called "authorities", but are not responsible for more than 
            education and health. This was a joke they told. 
            <P>But in truth, the political situations are entirely different. 
            There, we are speaking about "occupation"--even those in the Iraqi 
            council call it an occupation. But there are still some Iraqis who 
            believe that the American occupation is necessary in order to manage 
            the internal divisions. 
            <P>Al Iraqiya television, one of the TV stations founded by the 
            Americans and an official Iraqi channel, speaks of Palestine as an 
            "occupation", but when it talks about Iraq, it talks about the 
            "coalition forces." These people also do not find the two cases 
            similar. They see the Palestinians as having the right to rebel 
            against the Israeli occupation, and the Iraqi resistance as 
            illegitimate. 
            <P><B>bitterlemons:</B> When you spoke with Iraqis about how they 
            see their future, what did they say? Do they sound like 
            Palestinians? 
            <P><B>Atallah:</B> We were there supporting the Iraqi implementation 
            of a large survey about living conditions. We traveled all over 
            Kirkuk, Halqut and Yacouba. The Iraqis say they are unsure about 
            their future. At the beginning of the war, they had a lot of hope, 
            but now they are not sure how things will be. 
            <P>My Iraqi friends said that those of us living in Palestine and 
            Iraq are going to compete with each other for quite a long time over 
            whose situation is worse. But even as they make this comparison, 
            most of them believe that the Iraqi problem will be solved more 
            easily than the Palestinian problem. 
            <P><B>bitterlemons:</B> In your experience, how do Palestinians view 
            Iraq? 
            <P><B>Atallah:</B> A lot of Palestinians make the comparison in the 
            sense that when they watch television, it is hard for them to 
            distinguish [visually] between Iraq and Palestine. But the context 
            is very different. Here in Palestine, we are speaking about daily 
            conflict, not only with Israeli soldiers, but with the Israeli 
            people in the form of settlers, the bypass roads, the fence. 
            <P>I believe that the Iraqi problem is easily solved, when compared 
            with Palestine. Here, on the other hand, we are speaking about 
            another people that want to replace us, not only occupy us. They 
            want our land. There, it is more economic and another kind of 
            political agenda, for which there might be an agreement that you can 
            be happy with. But for Palestinians, any new agreement is 
            difficult--even [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon's proposal was 
            rejected by the Likud. Our issue is much more complicated.
