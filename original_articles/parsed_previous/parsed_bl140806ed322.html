<b>bitterlemons:</b> What caused a prominent political commentator for Maariv daily newspaper, Ben Caspit, to invite you to leave Israel at the height of the war in Lebanon?<P>

<b>Tibi:</b> I think that the general atmosphere of the Israeli state during the war was radical fear, frustration and an attempt to try to find the closest "enemy" that could easily be caught. This was done by targeting the Palestinian citizens of the state of Israel, mainly their leadership. Caspit did it by publishing this McCarthy-like article asking me to accommodate myself to his position, to support the war and the army, or to leave just because I said from the very beginning, "stop the war, I'm against it."<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How do you explain the seeming sympathy of the Arab citizens of Israel for Hizballah in this war, given that it is a Shi'ite movement and its rockets killed Israeli Arabs as well as Jews?<P>

<b>Tibi:</b> The overwhelming Arab view in Israel was against the war. The Arabs perceived Israel as the aggressive side and all of Lebanon as the victim of this huge military machine destroying infrastructure and killing hundreds of civilians--women, children and the aged. It was just natural that we would express empathy for the victim, saying at the same time that we are against targeting civilians, whether in Beirut, Haifa or Gaza.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What is your personal view of Hizballah, its ideology and the way this war started?<P>

<b>Tibi:</b> From the beginning, Hizballah said they would try to kidnap Israeli soldiers to exchange for Lebanese prisoners. It was obvious. I think that not to release Samir Kuntar [the most veteran and prominent Lebanese prisoner in Israel] at the last minute in 2004 [the last prisoner exchange] was a political mistake. When you leave an occupied land, you close the entire portfolio by releasing the prisoners also. The same mistake is being made by Israel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Obviously, from a socio-religious point of view we differ with Hizballah, but this is not the point at all. We are talking about supporting the war in Lebanon or not, supporting the destruction of Lebanon or not.<P>

When [Iranian leader Mahmoud] Ahmadinezhad said some months ago that Israel should be destroyed, I criticized this statement. The two-state solution is the best. We are in an era of constructing a state, not destroying a state.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Initially, for example when PM Olmert first spoke to the Knesset on July 17 about the war, the Arab members of Knesset did not criticize the Israeli war effort. What changed your minds?<P>

<b>Tibi:</b> Nothing. Just 15 minutes before Olmert's speech I proposed a motion of no confidence in this government, attacked it and opposed the war. Being silent during one speech should not be interpreted in an extreme way.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How do you assess the overall effect on Arab-Jewish relations in Israel of the Israeli Arab position in this war?<P>

<b>Tibi:</b> We say definitely that we are against sending rockets to Haifa and Nahariya. And we have empathy for the families killed and injured. I think the war itself, which was initiated against the most liberal and civilized Arab country in the area, with the destruction [it involved] and the positions of the [Israeli] political leadership and the press, enlarged the split between the Jewish majority and the Arab minority that was there already. The attempt to dictate to us opinions and positions by some journalists and leaders was a kind of fascist attempt to intimidate us because of our opposition to the war. These articles and positions were a clear cut fascist expression of an overwhelmingly bellicose spirit sweeping the country. <P>

But as usual, deja vu, we were there in 1982 when the consensus supported the war then was split and broken. Today we are in the same position, with consensus support for the war already starting to crumble. Meretz is changing its view, and the right wing is attacking the government and claiming poor management of the war. We were alone in the beginning, but now we are not. Yet no one will tell us after two or three months, "you were right," because we are Arabs and not part of the consensus. I am not sure that Ben Caspit will write, "Ahmed, I apologize."<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How do you assess the stability of the Olmert government now that there is a ceasefire?<P>

<b>Tibi:</b> As a physician, I can say "bad prognosis" from the personal and political aspect. Personally, [PM Ehud] Olmert has lost enormous points as a leader, [Defense Minister] Amir Peretz has lost a lot and is being attacked even in his Labor party, and [IDF Chief of Staff] Dan Halutz should be happy if he remains chief of staff, as should other generals of the general staff. Israel lost politically, militarily and socio-economically. The Israeli economy was devastated, with at least $4 billion in losses in markets. We said from the very beginning that this would happen. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How do you assess the ceasefire agreement?<P>

<b>Tibi:</b> First, there will be a cessation of the air war and missile attacks, but there will be confrontations in southern Lebanon; we are far from silence. Israel should withdraw from the Shebaa Farms and leave no excuse for anyone to say it controls Lebanese land. It shouldn't penetrate Lebanese airspace and coastal waters; Lebanon and Hizballah should do the same, respecting Israeli sovereignty. An exchange of prisoners will definitely take place. I said this from the beginning.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> You have traveled several times to Lebanon and know the leadership well. Are you a candidate to help mediate a prisoner exchange?<P>

<b>Tibi:</b> I don't think this is a task for someone like me from the Israeli Arab community. The Germans and other Europeans or the UN are best at this.- <i>Published 14/8/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
