<b>bitterlemons:</b> What is the current status of the wall?
<p>
<b>Juma':</b> Israel has now completed one-third of the wall, from Salim to south of Qalqilya [in the northern West Bank]. This section is more than 110 kilometers long. A week ago, Israel approved another $100 million to build the section of the wall that will attach the settlement of Ariel to Israel. 
<p>
The wall is now more visible than at any time before, and it is more clear what the Israelis intended this wall to be. We were told that there would be 26 gates in the wall [to allow Palestinians access to their land on the other side]. Of the six gates that have been built, two are totally closed. Other gates are partially closed [by barricades] and trucks can't cross to bring the produce from the fields. Most of the gates are only open for certain hours, and not the proper hours. For example, one gate is open from 7 to 8 in the morning and from 4 to 5 in the afternoon. But it is hot here, and farmers usually work from before dawn until six, then return to their fields in the late afternoon and come home late in the evening. 
<p>
The other thing that we are seeing is that farmers crossing the gates are being treated as if they are crossing into Israel, and are therefore being asked to show a permit. 
<p>
Lately, Israel has started to work on a road connecting Israeli land to a settlement just behind the wall [in the West Bank]. They didn't tell the Palestinian farmers [that owned this land] that the land would be confiscated but are behaving as if that land is now part of Israel. There was no notification, no confiscation order, nothing.They are doing what they want with it. It has become quite clear that Israel intended this to be a border, intended to confiscate this land, and intended to prevent the farmers from coming to their land.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What is your perception of the Bush administration's comments about the wall? 
<p>
<b>Juma':</b> We have had bad experiences with the US, even with what might have been called a more liberal administration. I think that these comments came out of the administration's frustration after it received criticism over the war in Iraq. After [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon arrived in Washington, Bush reversed himself and said that there was an understanding that the wall was for Israel's security. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What do you see as the greatest challenge in the campaign to fight the wall?
<p>
<b>Juma':</b> To mobilize the entire international community. We would like to believe that an apartheid system can no longer exist in this century, but now we are witnessing much worse. I think that we should work together to prevent this, but it is happening so quickly.
<p>
In a very short time we will see the West Bank divided into three major cantons and ten other enclaves and all the Palestinian people will be surrounded and besieged. Because of past experience, we won't now believe someone who only <i>talks</i> about this issue, because it seems that in this "peace" we are always paying the price. People have now learned that "peace" is meant only to satisfy Israel's needs, while no one seems to care about the occupation.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why should the average American or European care about this wall?
<p>
<b>Juma':</b> If we look at the second intifada and how the world has deteriorated, this region is one of the main reasons for this deterioration. We can't deny that September 11 was related to what is happening here. To solve the problem of the wall is to solve one of the fundamental issues in the region. 
<p>
I don't think it is very difficult; what is needed is for the international community to force Israel to apply international law. We don't want anything more than that. But what we are seeing now is that the decision-makers, those who <i>created</i> these laws, are just ignoring them and establishing new rules to satisfy Israel. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Are you satisfied with what the Palestinian Authority is doing on the issue?
<p>
<b>Juma':</b> Unfortunately, the Authority's actions came late, but we saw what happened when the Authority presented the issue, and how the Americans reacted. One of our main demands is that there be no negotiations without first stopping construction and dismantling this wall. Otherwise we will be falling into the trap of the Oslo accords. 
<p>
The first thing that Israel did after Oslo was to open the bypass roads [connecting the settlements to Israel] and to double the number of settlers. Now we are stuck because of this. If we go to negotiations now, the same thing will happen. We will talk for one or two years, the wall will be finished around us and we will be stuck again. But this time, they are putting the final touches on the conflict. 
<p>
I don't think that Palestinians will accept living in ghettos. This will not be the reward for their struggle and sacrifice. We were struggling for our freedom and for our identity and we won't accept to live as slaves controlled by a bunch of racist settlers, so I think that Palestinians will be much more aggressive, much more determined and much more together.
