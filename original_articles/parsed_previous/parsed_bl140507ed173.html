Taken at face value, the introduction of American benchmarks for Israel and the Palestinians--designed to alleviate the daily plight of Palestinians and remove irritating and suffocating roadblocks and enclosures--is a good thing. Here is the United States getting involved in the nuts and bolts of daily life in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Is this not what Israelis and Palestinians want? Is it not what the US has committed to do?<P>

At the same time, several questions linger: Does the US administration actually believe these benchmarks are attainable? Why risk another, albeit local failure? What is the point of presenting a plan that Washington knows both sides are politically and practically unable or unwilling to implement? This leads to the broader question of whether the idea of setting benchmarks is essentially a politically-driven, not to say public-relations, exercise in futility. <P>

The basic concept of an agreement on movement and access (AMA) was already presented in November 2005, at a time when all three parties--the US, Israel and the Palestinian Authority--were still enthusiastically paying lip-service to the roadmap, a grand sequential plan that made perfect theoretical sense but in practical terms was pronounced dead on arrival.<P>

Now a new document, drafted by US Ambassador in Israel Richard Jones and US Security Coordinator Major-General Keith Dayton, calls for Israeli compliance by specified due-dates (May, mid-June) with "benchmarks" for progress on roadblock removal around Palestinian cities and the easing of passage for Palestinians throughout the West Bank and Gaza. The document is thoughtful and reasonable, yet impractical.<P>

The plan was submitted to Israel a few days before the publication of a scathing report by the World Bank criticizing and accusing Israel of effectively preventing and impeding Palestinian access to 50 percent of the West Bank. Later, the US clarified the document by calling it "a flexible set of targets" rather than a fixed set of deadlines. Still, Israel expressed considerable objection to several of the major benchmarks, viewing them as security risks that should not be taken.<P> 

At a time when a military ground operation against Hamas and Islamic Jihad weapons stockpiles in Gaza is being debated, and following the criticism that over the past six years Hizballah was left unimpeded as it built up a missile arsenal in Lebanon, it is difficult to see Israel consenting to lift roadblocks around Nablus.<P>

It is hard to believe that the administration had no prior knowledge of the contents of the World Bank report. So what, then, was Washington's interest and objective in presenting the benchmarks? And why do it concurrently with the publication of the Winograd commission interim report (on the 2006 war in Lebanon), which significantly weakened Prime Minister Olmert's already untenable position? It is equally difficult to see either the US or Israel benefiting from back and forth haggling over certain benchmarks that Israel treats as "non-starters". <P>

So what's the point? It's about politics, regional and local. The US knows that by June Israel will have a new defense minister and conceivably, before the end of 2007, a new prime minister. As seen from Washington, the Israeli political timetable is linked to developments in Iraq (where the administration has also set security benchmarks for the Iraqi government) and to the Bush administration's legacy in the Middle East. The administration's major actors have about 12 months before judgment is passed on their performance as the 2008 presidential elections enter into high gear.<P>

The US has to be perceived as being involved in the Israeli-Palestinian process (if that is the appropriate term for what is essentially an ongoing impasse) if it wants European and Arab support for a variety of critical policies in the broader region: withdrawal from Iraq, containment of Iran, mitigating anti-American sentiment in the Arab world and war on terrorism. Secretary of State Rice knows that PM Ehud Olmert's meetings with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are "Seinfeld" meetings: no amount of photo-ops and platitudes can conceal that they are about nothing. She also knows that Olmert's political and public legitimacy problem in Israel following the Winograd report (and before the final report comes out in September) prevents him from initiating any move or even seriously entertaining the Arab League (a.k.a. Saudi) peace plan.<P>

In addition, the US has to maintain and sustain the boycott of the Hamas-led Palestinian government. The Europeans are still complying, but cracks are bound to develop if the US stands-by and adopts a policy of benevolent non-intervention.<P>

The US has confronted the Palestinians on many occasions since 9/11, effectively endorsing Israel's policies. There was harsh criticism in both the Arab world and in Europe over this "imbalanced pro-Israeli" stance. On an issue like the benchmarks plan, the US can afford (as can Olmert) to declare "disagreement" or even "friction" and express sympathy for the Palestinians. <P>

Washington has neither a comprehensive and coherent policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict nor Israeli and Palestinian partners with which to develop such a plan. So a series of smaller, incremental measures is all that can be offered at this stage in the hope that within a few months the Arab League plan will become more acceptable. Until then, it is "we tried, but we cannot want this more than the parties".- <i>Published 14/5/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
