<b>bitterlemons:</b> Hamas' long term hudna proposal asks for a full Israeli withdrawal to 1967 borders in return for a long-term ceasefire. Does this mean there will be no ceasefire until such a withdrawal has occurred, or does Hamas' proposal include the possibility that a hudna can start once a cast-iron Israeli commitment to such a withdrawal and a clear timetable has been given and a process has started?<P>

<b>al-Bardawil:</b> The hudna was suggested at a specific period. The Israelis rejected it, so it is no longer under consideration and European initiatives are being explored instead.<P>

But the truce was based on establishing an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital as a temporary solution that did not entail recognition of Israel. The idea is to reach a state of quiet in the region and avoid the state of perpetual war and that way give the present generations a chance to live in safety and security.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why would Israel consider this proposal? What does it offer Israel that the PLO's position does not?<P>
 
<b>al-Bardawil:</b> The truce would give Israelis a chance to live in peace and safety for a significant period of time. The timeframe is not definite but the alternative is to live only with war.<P>

When the Oslo agreement was signed, it was done after international and regional pressure. Most Palestinians were not satisfied with the agreement, which didn't meet even a minimum of Palestinian rights, and that's why since 1994 many uprisings have broken out. What the Israelis offered at Oslo were worthless bubbles that quickly burst.<P>

Hamas has since won a majority in elections indicating that a majority of Palestinians agree with its political program. Hamas, in other words, is the only party in the Palestinian arena that can guarantee security and stability. We offer Palestinian consensus.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What would the status of the areas Israel leaves be and how would that affect the overall political picture? <P>

<b>al-Bardawil:</b> In the case that such an independent Palestinian state is created, it will be independent in all respects, with full sovereignty over land, sea and air space and with full control over its borders. There can be no settlements and no wall. Relations will be conducted in much the same way as relations are now between Arab countries that border but do not recognize Israel.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How would border arrangements work?<P>
 
<b>al-Bardawil:</b> There are many examples in the world, as Khalid Meshaal said, where countries antagonistic to each other live calmly as neighbors, e.g., China and Taiwan. The Palestinian state created by this arrangement will not recognize Israel, but in reality both will live in quiet beside the other. We want to give the opportunity to the next generations to decide their future, whatever that may be.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What would happen should either side, or elements on either side, fail to respect the ceasefire?<P>

<b>al-Bardawil:</b> We won't have such a truce without international and regional guarantees and commitments to ensure that any violation by either party is punished. The international community's role will be to supervise and monitor the truce. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What would happen at the end of the period of the ceasefire? Would negotiations commence on outstanding issues, and if they fail, what then?<P>

<b>al-Bardawil:</b> That will be for future generations to decide. - <i>Published 20/11/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
