an interview with Fadle Naqib

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Binyamin Netanyahu has vowed to improve the Palestinian economy, thereby improving chances for peace. Is this a realistic aim?
<p>
<b>Naqib:</b> I don't think it is realistic and I think that has been proven time and again. The premise of Oslo was that if you try to improve Palestinian livelihoods it will help the overall problem. That was proven wrong.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> But Netanyahu said there are certain measures--measures the Palestinian Authority has called for--like lifting checkpoints...
<p>
<b>Naqib:</b> But this is ignorant. If you go back to 1987 when the first intifada began, there were no checkpoints and there was no economic problem. In fact, at that time the Palestinian economy was in very good shape. 
<p>
The problem is political. It is about self-determination and it's about justice. It's not an economic problem. Israel is using the economy in order to break the Palestinian will, to break the resistance and Palestinian determination. That's why the economy is in such a bad state. But its not an economic problem, it's a political problem. It's about sovereignty, the return of refugees and the right of self-determination. If you improve the economic situation this will not solve the problem.
<p>
As a matter of fact, this is an idea we've heard many times before. We've heard it from Israel and we've heard it from other governments and international bodies. It contains an element of racism. It says basically that the non-white people, the third world people, the Muslim people and the colored people do not behave according to principles, they behave according to instincts and if you feed them they will do whatever you want them to do. We don't hear about economic problems when there is conflict between two major powers. But when it comes to the third world, this is a common suggestion.
<p>
So there is an element of racism and ignorance too. I have not seen any situation where the economy has solved a political problem.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Netanyahu says that he will continue political negotiations along with improving the economy, yet his long-held position is that he will not make any compromise on Jerusalem and refugees. So where does this leave us?
<p>
<b>Naqib:</b> He says that economy does not solve the problem but it makes it easier. So he believes that if you improve the Palestinian economy, Palestinians will be ready to make concessions.
<p>
[Palestinian Prime Minister] Salam Fayyad said this is not an economic problem, it's a political problem and it needs a political solution. I agree completely.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Of course the economy is in pretty bad shape...
<p>
<b>Naqib:</b> Sure, because Israel is using economic pressure as a tool to break the will of the Palestinian people. The economy is a factor that needs to be looked at in terms of peace building, no question, but it's not a substitute for a political solution.-<i> Published 24/11/2008 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
