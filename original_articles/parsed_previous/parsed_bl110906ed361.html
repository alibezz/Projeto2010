The Palestinian cause has become a victim of 9/11 in more than one respect. First and foremost, 9/11 enabled Israel to successfully conflate the legitimate Palestinian struggle and resistance against the illegal Israeli occupation with terrorism. <P>

Israel has long been trying to convince American and European governments, as well as public opinion, especially in the West, that the Palestinian struggle against the occupation is illegitimate. Israel has always claimed that its own violence against Palestinians came only in reaction to Palestinian violence against Israelis and was thus self-defense.<P>

Previously, Israel was only moderately successful in this endeavor because the majority of the world's governments and their publics were able to see the vicious cycle of violence between Palestinians and Israelis as falling within the context of an illegal occupation. That's why international efforts, starting with the Madrid conference and ending with the roadmap, always included clauses indicating the necessity of ending the occupation as the means to achieve peace. <P>

But the events of 9/11, the emergence of al-Qaeda in Arab and Islamic countries and that group's continuing ability to perpetrate terrorist attacks against civilians in different parts of the world, created an atmosphere in which Israeli propaganda--seeking to portray Israel's continued occupation of Palestinian land as part of the struggle between the West and the free world against terrorism--was more readily accepted.<P>

The Palestinian leadership, in particular the late Yasser Arafat, was among the first to sense the danger. In hindsight, it was obvious which way the wind was blowing when Israeli leaders, including Ehud Barak, Shimon Peres and Benyamin Netanyahu, volunteered on international TV to offer the "expertise" they had developed in fighting "Palestinian terrorism".<P>

At that early stage Arafat, in a closed meeting with the heads of all the Palestinian factions including the Islamists, pointed out the danger and underlined his conviction that Palestinians now needed to stop any kind of violent activity against Israelis. <P>

Everybody at that meeting seemed to agree and understand. A unilateral ceasefire was entered into by all factions and a few weeks of calm followed. But the calm was punctuated by a series of unprovoked Israeli assassinations and violent attacks against Palestinian targets, including against civilians. Unfortunately, even though many warned that these assassinations were provocations to force a violent Palestinian response, the Palestinian factions duly resumed their attacks, including against Israeli civilians. <P>

The world, especially the West, did not see the provocations, but only the reactions. Israel's propaganda job had been made easier.<P>

On a different level, 9/11 contributed to giving international relations a religious and ideological flavor at the expense of the legal, political and economic parameters with which they were usually conducted. To the Palestinian cause, dependent as it is on international legality, that was a serious setback. In general, where once nations and peoples argued on the basis of international law and political treaties in addition to issues of economic development and exploitation, and problems could be solved on rational bases, logic has now gone out the window.<P>

The world has been witnessing an increase in ideological radicalism and religious extremism in both the West and the East. There is a Christian fundamentalist influence in Washington while there are extreme interpretations of Islam gaining currency in the Middle East. The current religious and ideological flavor that governs international relations makes it harder to find solutions to crises and makes dialogue more difficult because logic and reason are no longer relied upon.<P> 

In addition, 9/11 gave rise to unfortunate policy stratagems, particularly from the West. The wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and now, possibly, Iran, are being justified in terms of a catchall and ill-defined global foreign policy aim called the "war against terror". But neither war fought so far would seem to have yielded much result for the West. On the contrary, the world seems a more dangerous place now than it was before those invasions and the scant regard they paid to international law.<P>

The recent phenomena of extremism, whether religious or ideological, do need to be understood, but they cannot be understood only in political and security terms. The economic marginalization of certain parts of the world, the failure of most of the regimes in the Arab world to ensure economic prosperity, the regional increase in unemployment, especially among the young, the use by powerful countries like the US of globalization as a means for domination, not only economic and political but also cultural and ideological, and the continuing injustice created by regional conflicts like the Palestinian-Israeli conflict on which the world appears unwilling to act decisively, were and are all factors contributing to an atmosphere that created al-Qaeda.<P> 

The problem is not only the individuals that are willing to commit the violence. The problem is the environment that creates not only these individuals but a public opinion that allows them to flourish. <P>

For these reasons, non-political but influential personalities and groups should be invited to come up with a better understanding of the phenomenon of radicalization and extremism and the tendency to violence that has been occurring in different parts of the world. It is important to understand the causes that create such desperation, and those causes undoubtedly mostly stem from social, economic, cultural as well as political circumstances. Only this way can long-term solutions be formulated that aim at reducing the growing gap in wealth and other aspects of life between the different parts of humanity.- <i>Published 11/9/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
