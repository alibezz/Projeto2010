
a conversation with Hasan Khriesheh

<b>bitterlemons:</b> According to the Israeli daily <i>Haaretz</i>, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told his cabinet on June 1st that his plan to disengage from the Gaza Strip might include a Jordanian presence in the West Bank. What would be the advantage to Israel of such an arrangement?
<P>
<b>Khriesheh:</b> I think that what Sharon says is just for Israeli and international public opinion to market himself as a peacemaker, but nothing will happen in the next six to seven months. Sharon is always talking about peace while doing things on the ground [that contravene peace]. About a Jordanian, Egyptian, or any Arab role, this is not clear. He may plan for a Jordanian role, but the other parties have to participate in these plans. The Egyptian side has agreed to a role; up to now we haven't heard from Jordan. 
<P>
Sharon can't put conditions on Egypt or Jordan in order to disengage from Gaza. The Israelis are disengaging because they have come to the conclusion that they cannot rule over the Palestinian people. This statement was made for the benefit of the public and his party.
<P>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What would be the pros and cons of such a role--training police, advising, etc.--for Jordan?
<P>
<b>Khriesheh:</b> There have been no arrangements for disengagement from the West Bank, so the Jordanian role of giving advice on security is not clear. It will be two to three years before Israel's plans for the West Bank are clear. Sharon wants to leave the Gaza Strip and continue occupying the West Bank forever while declaring it legal according to the Americans. The real battle will be in the West Bank.
<P>
The Jordanians will not be interested in a role in the West Bank, because history is going forward, not backward. Jordan is stable now, and its government will think many times before taking on such a role in the West Bank. Jordan has no interest in the West Bank at this time, because the Palestinian issue could threaten the stability of the kingdom and upset the delicate balance between majority and minority. 
<P>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Would the Palestinian Authority welcome a Jordanian role in disengagement?  Where could Jordan be useful?
<P>
<b>Khriesheh:</b> The PA will accept a Jordanian role in training the security forces in Palestine. We want Arab participation in the building of our own state and the training of our people, but any other role is not accepted. The Palestinian people want all Arab countries to stand on our side against the Israeli occupier. We will not accept for any Arab country to be a mediator. We accept them as partners.
<P>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What about the militias and the Palestinian street?
<P>
<b>Khriesheh:</b> We have good relations with all Arab countries and Arab people; they all help us in this catastrophe in which we live. Jordan and Egypt are good supporters of the Palestinian cause. Having good relations with Jordan is acceptable to everyone, but any other role is not appropriate at this time.
<P>
Sharon's plan is just a bluff to show the world that he is a peacemaker, but we are sure that he is a killer.  He is trying to involve Arab countries in this conflict as mediators.
