<b>bitterlemons:</b> You wrote an article in Arabic just after the January elections suggesting that Palestinians themselves dismantle the Palestinian Authority. Why this, and why now?
<p>
<b>Issa:</b> I first began to call for this after the Camp David summit [in 2000]. When the Palestinian Authority was created, it was intended to be a transitional government for a maximum of five years until the final status of the Palestinian state was negotiated. It may have been good for that and for building trust between the two sides. But the Palestinian Authority was not designed as a long-term or permanent solution, and this has been proven over time. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> In what way?
<p>
<b>Issa:</b> The powers that the Palestinian Authority has under the Oslo accords have been slowly decreasing. Israel uses the fact that there is a Palestinian Authority, forcing it to prevent Palestinian resistance and using it in the international arena to monopolize Palestinians. At the same time, Israel has a free hand to do what it wants. The US and some European countries are very comfortable with this situation. 
<p>
There is also clearly a lack of equality in the current international position against Hamas, in its leadership of the Palestinian Authority. When an Israeli killed [former Israeli prime minister Yizhak] Rabin, and the Israeli public subsequently elected right-wing politician Benjamin Netanyahu who ran in these elections against the peace process, the US and Europe did not sanction Israel. 
<p>
Palestinians currently have no power to face [Israeli Prime Minister Ehud] Olmert's plan [to set Israel's borders] and the wall [being built in the West Bank] because of the US position. The only option for Palestinians now is to dismantle the Palestinian Authority and to force Israel to reoccupy the West Bank and Gaza. That way, the wall will be meaningless and Olmert's plan will be put to an end. We will return to the clear reality that we are a people under a foreign occupation, and Israel will be a direct occupier instead of being able to hide behind a screen. 
<P>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Your proposal comes at a time when some are sounding the alarm that the Palestinian Authority must be protected from collapse, other Fateh members are calling for the dismantling of the Palestinian Authority, and Hamas is also saying that, if forced from power, it will never return to the political arena. How does your thinking fit into this context?
<P>
<b>Issa:</b> Hamas, by participating in the elections and being in the parliament and government, has accepted participation in Oslo because the elections were regulated by the Oslo agreement. Hamas and Fateh and the other factions who have joined the Palestinian Authority are part of Oslo and are acting under the ceiling of Oslo, whether they like it or not. As such, Fateh and Hamas are now powerless to face Olmert's plan or the wall. There is nothing to be done according to Oslo to stop the wall or to stop Olmert's plans, especially with the position of the US government being one where [US President George] Bush has said he will accept Israel's facts on the ground. Europe is powerless to force Israel to follow international law or even Oslo. 
<P>
As long as we are still operating within the Oslo process and still have the Palestinian Authority, we are not able to face Israeli aggression. We will only be able to do so as a nation under occupation resisting the occupation, without a national authority in the middle. In the new situation, Europe and the US will have new responsibilities to force Israel to follow international humanitarian law. We will have a clear mission, a clear purpose, and a clear struggle; under Oslo and the Palestinian Authority we have only lost. In every respect, our lives are worse: the restrictions on movement, the killings, the assassinations, the economy and so on. 
<P>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Describe, then, a landscape without the Palestinian Authority.
<P>
<b>Issa:</b> If we take this step, the Americans and Israelis will beg us not to do it. If we do dismantle the Palestinian Authority, then Israel will have no choice but to come back as direct occupiers. It will not take them long--they are right here already. And I believe that Palestinians without the Palestinian Authority will be more disciplined. The crime rate before the Palestinian Authority was much lower. People will no longer be pessimistic, blaming the Palestinian Authority for their problems or saying, "look what we got for our struggle." Already there are Israeli troops in our streets, in our homes, in our restaurants--let's make them take responsibility for their actions.- <i>Published 15/5/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
