an interview with Ali Jarbawi

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Did the launch of the Israeli ground offensive come as a surprise to you?
<p>
<b>Jarbawi:</b> No. It was obvious that Israel would not achieve its goals with just air strikes, so 
it was coming. However, it seems to me that Israel is wary of a full-scale ground invasion. Israel 
wants to achieve victory with the least number of casualties, and this will never happen because 
Gaza is a jungle of cement, of civilian houses. So in order to achieve its goals, the Israeli army 
will have to go into these highly populated areas. That is why I think they're stumbling.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What does Israel hope to achieve?
<p>
<b>Jarbawi:</b> I think the minimum Israel wants is a long-term truce on its conditions, i.e., no 
more rocket fire from Gaza, no more weapon tunnels and a demilitarized Hamas.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is this achievable?
<p>
<b>Jarbawi:</b> The operation will continue for a long time, and there needs to be international 
intervention to impose the terms of any ceasefire on both parties. How much Israel on its own can 
achieve without significant casualties I don't know. It might be able to achieve it objectives with 
a full ground invasion, meaning a full re-occupation of all of Gaza.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> And you don't think Israel wants that?
<p>
<b>Jarbawi:</b> No, because Israel will become entangled for a long time, there is an election 
coming and a new American administration on January 20. I think time is up then.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> For the offensive?
<p>
<b>Jarbawi:</b> The offensive may continue beyond the twentieth, but I don't think this is the aim. 
I don't think Israel wants a new US administration to take office with this on its hands.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> So when you say an end to the offensive will need international intervention, 
do you mean from a new US administration?
<p>
<b>Jarbawi:</b> Either from that or from other quarters. If the Israeli government realizes it won't 
be able to achieve its goals with a limited operation it may find international intervention 
convenient. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> So, there has to be a political solution; there can't be a military solution.
<p>
<b>Jarbawi:</b> Yes, unless Israel decides on a full re-occupation of Gaza and is prepared to go 
from house to house.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> When might a political solution take shape?
<p>
<b>Jarbawi:</b> Let's see what [French President Nikolas] Sarkozy has in his pocket and what the 
UN's Security Council can agree on. If Sarkozy has something that can pass the Security Council then 
the pressure may start on both sides. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Who, in the longer term, stands to gain from this?
<p>
<b>Jarbawi:</b> I think everyone will claim victory. Israel can claim an end to rocket fire. Hamas 
can claim that it withstood the Israeli onslaught and wasn't liquidated and remains a resistance 
movement. Maybe the Palestinian Authority might gain something as well if there is to be a reopening 
of the Rafah crossing with a role for the PA and a renewal of the internal Palestinian dialogue. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What are the necessary compromises?
<p>
<b>Jarbawi:</b> Does Israel want a re-unification of the West Bank and Gaza and Palestinian national 
unity? I am not so sure. If Hamas continues--and Israel cannot actually destroy the movement's base
--Hamas can claim victory. Hamas will gain recognition at home and abroad and that may open up 
avenues for Hamas to talk to other parties, the Europeans and maybe even the Americans.
<p>
For the dust to finally settle, we need a new political initiative. To go back to the old process of 
open-ended negotiations, which Israel has been taking advantage of to extend infinitely, will not 
do. That way lies only further chaos and bloodshed.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Could all of this have been avoided?
<p>
<b>Jarbawi:</b> To tell you the truth I don't think it could. Palestinians have two strategies for 
dealing with the occupation, both of which have produced no results: endless negotiations on the one 
hand, and resistance without a political framework on the other. The root cause of the problem, 
however, is Israel. From the beginning Israel was not interested in reaching a negotiated agreement, 
but wanted to impose a settlement. If we had had a serious political process from the beginning it 
would have avoided what is happening in Gaza.-<i> Published 5/1/2009 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
