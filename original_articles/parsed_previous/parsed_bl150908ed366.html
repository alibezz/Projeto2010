an interview with Hasan Asfour

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Fifteen years on, how do you look now at Oslo?
<p>
<b>Asfour:</b> The problem for the Oslo process was that it was seeking agreement between two peoples that had been in conflict for tens of years during which each of the sides had denied the existence of the other in one way or another. 
<p>
The nature of the conflict, however, forced both sides to come to terms with the fact that you cannot cancel out the other. Therefore a framework was designed to create a new relationship and a new atmosphere in the region according to what could realistically be done and not according to absolute values. I believe we might have reached an historic solution if some of the ground rules at the time had been allowed to run their natural course. 
<p>
The agreement itself came during the first intifada, which had contributed to changing the attitude among Israelis and the world toward the Palestinian people to such an extent that it became evident the occupation could not continue forever. It also came in the context of a changing strategic regional environment and the first Gulf War. 
<p>
The goal of the agreement was to go through a transitional stage in order to reach permanent agreement. The purpose of this was the continuation of the vision of the peace process as a way of choosing negotiations for a political solution between the two sides over conflict. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What lessons have been learned, or should have been learned, by Palestinians from Oslo?
<p>
<b>Asfour:</b> I think that the main lesson learned is that reaching agreement is not the same thing as implementing agreement. And even if there is the potential and a strong will to commit, that does not mean that we can only partially commit ourselves or not give the negotiations process our full attention. Meaning, the Oslo agreement provided us with a very important concrete start, but we didn't deal with it as we should have, maybe because, as Palestinians, we lived under great pressure, or maybe because this pressure led to negative attitudes toward the process. 
<p>
There are, of course, many things that shouldn't have happened the way they did. Israel should not have been allowed to stop the negotiating process. We shouldn't compromise international commitments more than necessary. In 1999, I think we missed a very important opportunity when there was talk about unilaterally declaring an independent Palestinian state. I also think that between 2000-2001, we allowed Israel to interfere militarily in the internal situation while we acted between confrontation and irresponsibility. We allowed a duality in the Palestinian Authority to emerge when we allowed weapons to be bought that created an authority within the authority. 
<p>
Palestinians also failed to realize the true importance of the Arab hinterland. When we were negotiating or after we had reached agreement of some sort, there was no cooperation in any deep sense or coordination with Arab countries, even during the hardest of times. We behaved as if America and Israel were capable of forcing on the Arabs whatever agreements we reached. In other words, the trust in Israel, in some ways and at certain times, went beyond what was called for by the spirit of the agreement. Of course the moment this trust evaporated, Israel started its war against us. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> We are in the middle of the Annapolis process now. Some say this is a very similar process in a very similar situation. Is this something you, as a veteran of Oslo, can recognize?
<p>
<b>Asfour:</b> No, I think there is now a drastic change in the political reality and in the political purpose and intentions of Israeli proposals. What is happening now can be traced back to the failure of the July 2000 Camp David summit, a failure that in my opinion lies squarely with the Israelis. 
<p>
That failure put us into conflict, and the Israeli goal from this conflict was to destroy the PA. Since 2000, or to be more precise, since Ariel Sharon's visit to the Haram al-Sharif on Sept 20, 2000, Israel wanted to obliterate the PA. This was not merely an Israeli attempt at pressuring the PA; it was about destroying the PA by destroying its leader, Yasser Arafat.
<p>
Once the PA was exhausted, the Israelis and Americans forced an election that they knew would end in one of two ways: either Hamas would win, putting an end to the political process, or Fateh would win, causing Hamas to take to the streets with its many weapons. The result is what we see today. 
<p>
In other words, Israeli strategy is completely different now than it was under Yitzhak Rabin, who said agreement would lead to the end of occupation. Today, Israel is trying to re-invent the occupation under the cover of agreement. There is a huge difference between now and then. 
<p>
For example, there is the process of Judaizing Jerusalem and building more settlements. This is all done in order to end the possibility of an independent Palestinian state emerging. By Judaizing Jerusalem Israel is trying to render the Clinton formula---that what's Palestinians should be Palestinian and what's Jewish is Jewish--irrelevant. Israel is also exacerbating and exaggerating intra-Palestinian divisions in order to run away from its own political obligations. 
<p>
There can be no comparison between now and when Oslo was reached. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> You are not hopeful, then, that agreement can be reached by the end of the year?
<p>
<b>Asfour:</b> No, there is no prospect of reaching a full political agreement at this stage. Israel is not even close to accepting a political resolution that respects the basis of the peace process. The peace process considers the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip as the territory where a Palestinian state should be built. This is in line with international law and United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 and 338.
<p>
What Israel is doing is revoking the concepts embodied by these two resolutions. Palestinians, Arab countries and the international community are guilty of not putting enough pressure on Israel to abide by international law. But Israel is busy trying to introduce new political frameworks and maybe even definitions. Thus, in my opinion, there is no possibility of any serious political agreement nor is there even a horizon. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you agree then with those, among them your former colleague Ahmed Qurei, who say that time is running out for the two-state solution and Palestinians might have to pursue a one-state solution?
<p>
<b>Asfour:</b> Such a move would constitute running away from trying to ensure agreement to the creation of an independent state by staying under Israeli rule. Then we would have to wait for the South African experience to run its course. This means waiting tens of years and enduring racism and discrimination before Palestinians can taste freedom. I think this is a choice of frustration and not one of progress.-<i> Published 15/9/2008 &copy; bitterlemons.org </i>
