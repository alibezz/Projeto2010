an interview with Yehya Mousa

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Almost all countries represented in New York reiterated the importance of Palestinian-Israeli peace. What can Palestinians do to make use of such political momentum?<P>

<b><b>Mousa:</b></b> There was nothing new introduced in New York. On the contrary, they returned to resuscitate a dead corpse, the roadmap. This roadmap is used by the Americans to extend the conflict and not solve the Palestinian cause. We didn't see New York as a chance, on the contrary, there was a setback.<P>

I think what they should have discussed is a new plan with a new vision that corresponds with the basic rights of the Palestinian people. Such a plan would have the end of the negotiations clearly specified and determined, namely the establishment of a truly independent Palestinian state. Anything else is a waste of time and only prolongs and increases the suffering of the Palestinian people. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> The Quartet stands firm on its demands on Hamas. Hamas stands firm in rejecting them. Can a compromise be worked out, and if so, what is it?<P>

<b><b>Mousa:</b></b> It is more important for Palestinians to work out what we need from our national dialogue. National unity is more important than foreign preconditions. The Palestinian factions must meet, like they met on the national conciliation document, which is considered the main principle that can lead us out of our current crisis, to create a consensus about Palestinian rights. <P>

If we stay in the pit of foreign conditions, we revert to the previous system that caused the intifada. With preconditions we will be hostages to political extortion again. This will take us back to the same catastrophes that Fateh led us to in the last 12 years. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> The unity government is seen as a way out of the crisis, but will a unity government provide such a way? Is it even possible?<P>

<b><b>Mousa:</b></b> The national unity government is about political will and that political will exists already in Hamas. Now the most important thing is to find the political will, free from foreign conditions, in our brothers in Fateh as well. At the moment, they don't want a national unity government; they are involved in a coup against the PA. <P>

Look for example at how the ministers had their detention extended by Israel. The Israelis are happy to help reshape the Palestinian political reality and see a coup against the elections. The developments with our brothers in Fateh are taking us in the wrong direction in a way that doesn't help our national interests. And that which doesn't act in our national interest aids only our enemy. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What is the likelihood for a prisoner exchange, and how important is it?<P>

<b><b>Mousa:</b></b> The prisoners' issue is everybody's issue. The price we are paying now is because of our determination and insistence on the issue of prisoners. The exchange of prisoners is a natural right and our prisoners must be released in honor and dignity. Such an exchange must be simultaneous, because we do not trust our enemy and we cannot put such an issue in their hands. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is the Hamas government ready to negotiate with Israel, without preconditions?<P>

<b><b>Mousa:</b></b> It is not necessary that the Hamas government negotiate directly with Israel. There should be alternatives by negotiating through third parties, and any negotiations process should be based on not recognizing the Zionist entity. In any case, according to the national conciliation document, it was agreed that the PLO is the body that is authorized to play this role. <P>

Hamas has a clear position on these issues based on not recognizing the occupation and not recognizing realities that were imposed on the ground. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is there any point at the moment to a meeting of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli PM Ehud Olmert?<P>

<b><b>Mousa:</b></b> There is no horizon for such a meeting. Olmert is using Abbas to squeeze out of his internal crisis. He has no new initiative or peace plan. Furthermore, Zionist society is not ready to give Palestinians their rights. So, we carry no hopes from such meetings. On the contrary, they will take us in the wrong direction.- <i>Published 25/9/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
