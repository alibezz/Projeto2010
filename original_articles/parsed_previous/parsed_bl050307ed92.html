an interview with Samir Abdullah

</table><p>
  

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is there a real separation happening between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank?<P>

<b>Abdullah:</b> Yes. And it is harsher than ever. Now there is no trade between the West Bank and Gaza. If you have a small shipment you have to work for a week to obtain permission. If you wish to get a visa from an embassy located in Gaza you have to wait three days to wait for DHL or Aramex. If you are lucky you will get a visa in another three or four days. <P>

Israel has not implemented the Agreement on Movement and Access, and for example, the Karni crossing only handles between 10 to 12 trucks a day. The capacity, the need, is 400 trucks a day, and that was stipulated in the AMA.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is this an intentional policy?<P>

<b>Abdullah:</b> Oh yes. It is intended to impoverish Palestinians in order to weaken us. It makes it difficult for Palestinians to live here, it worsens the investment climate, and with no investment, no jobs are created. People are left with little choice but to seek their fortune outside Palestine.<P> 

This is the ultimate goal. The end for Israel is to deal with what they call the "demographic threat", and all Israel's policies and daily practices are designed with that in mind.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What is the scale of the problem?<P>

<b>Abdullah:</b> According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, unemployment is around 28 percent, and higher in Gaza. The poverty rate shows that two-thirds of the population lives under the poverty line. It is a disastrous situation and it is getting worse every day. <P>

There is a major breakdown in all aspect of Palestinian lives, whether we talk about law and order, crime rates or other standards of behavior. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How is this separation seen in Gaza as opposed to the West Bank?<P>

<b>Abdullah:</b> Gaza is mainly a labor reservoir. There are limited resources and Gazans are very much dependent on Israel and on trade and aid. Jobs there are mainly created by the Palestinian Authority, but these jobs are no longer well paid and there is no regular payment.<P>

People are waiting. There is a state of suspension. People are losing hope every day and nothing is happening. Now we are waiting for the government to be established and for it to arrange for regular payments to civil sector employees and maybe start some development work.<P>

If this does not materialize, the crisis will continue to grow until it explodes.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What is a possible Palestinian response to this situation?<P>

<b>Abdullah:</b> We are starting to put our house in order. The Mecca agreement is a good start. Hopefully it will be implemented quicker than planned, because a slow implementation only creates frustration. We need to have a national unity government with a program that can mobilize support of all kinds, not only economic, but also political, to move forward on the political front. <P>

There has to be pressure on Israel to stop its actions and comply with agreements it has signed with the PLO. We have to look for a new mechanism to resolve the conflict once and for all. There is no alternative for us other than to push Israel to final status negotiations and come up with an agreement based on UN Security Council resolutions and international law.<P>

The world, by the way, is fed up with this conflict and there is a consensus that there should be a Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace with Israel.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> And yet, the world seems reluctant to accept this unity government.<P>

<b>Abdullah:</b> The unity government should have a program that is in harmony with Arab and international legitimacy, which would mean there is no reason for Europe or any other country to continue boycotting the government.<P>

But we can't accept the Quartet conditions, which simply state the Israeli position. The international community, before it asks our government to explicitly recognize Israel, should ask Israel to recognize agreements it has signed. Conditions should be mutual. But there is no pressure on Israel, despite the fact that it is Israel that breached agreements and ended the peace process.<P> 

<b>bitterlemons:</b> If this unity government fails to convince the world and this separation of Gaza and the West Bank continues, what do you foresee?<P>

<b>Abdullah:</b> I see an outbreak of a new wave of military actions and reactions and a new cycle of violence that will not benefit any party and is in the interest of neither the Israeli nor the Palestinian people.- <i>Published 5/3/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
