<b>bitterlemons:</b> How has the issue of corruption shaped the Palestinian-Israeli conflict?
<p>
<b>Jawad Saleh:</b> In fact, it has shaped not the conflict, but our conception of "peace". From the beginning, when Palestinians and Israelis crafted the Oslo agreement and commenced its implementation, the Israelis (with the Americans behind them) opened private accounts in Israeli banks in the name of [Palestinian President Yasser] Arafat, to which all the taxes collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinian Authority were diverted. This was the source of all our troubles concerning corruption.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why has that damaged Palestinian fiscal management?
<p>
<b>Jawad Saleh:</b> The Israelis thought that if Arafat was encouraged to be corrupt and to be satisfied with the money that he received [that way], he might offer the Israelis more compromises and, therefore, acquiesce to their demands. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why do Palestinians make direct links between fiscal corruption and political corruption, or the abandonment of the Palestinian cause?
<p>
<b>Jawad Saleh:</b> The Israelis were really helping the Palestinian Authority to be corrupt by allowing for these private banking accounts. The whole aim was to seduce the Palestinian Authority into corruption. When you are a corrupt person who is also a decision maker, you are always distracted by where you can steal money, how you can hide the theft, where you can go with it--I think that any patriot or responsible leader at any level will experience damaged efficacy and some negative ramifications just by virtue of an agenda that differs from his work.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> There has been a great internal focus on corruption since then. Do you think that matters have improved?
<p>
<b>Jawad Saleh:</b> Yes, to a certain extent. I think that [Palestinian Minister of Finance] Salam Fayyad has tackled the basics of reform in the financial sector, but he has not yet completed this task satisfactorily. For example, concerning the investments of the Palestinian Authority, he [Fayyad] has gained control of some, but we as the Palestinian Legislative Council have not yet received the complete report of all of the companies and various investments of the Palestinian Authority, whether international or public. He promised when he presented the budget of 2003 that he would have this information for us 15 days after we were to give our vote of confidence in the budget. Now one year has passed.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How much does international pressure play into the process of reform?
<p>
<b>Jawad Saleh:</b> They set in motion the reforms, but I think that there is a resistance to true reform on the part of some who are interested in avoiding a disruption of their practices. There is a resistance to making these reforms comprehensive and total. Because of that, the problem lies with the decision makers in the Palestinian Authority.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Does it help when the United States or the European Union put pressure on the Palestinian Authority?
<p>
<b>Jawad Saleh:</b> Not the way the Americans are doing it. When you want someone to tell you "no" then you can ask him or her in a manner that will ensure a negative response. They are bragging about it; they are talking it up. Especially Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. In reality, this [approach] damages Palestinians more than it benefits or encourages them. Both sides could make better use of diplomatic procedures and processes, rather than this vulgar way of acting. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What do you think that the possible indictment of Ariel Sharon would do for the issue of corruption?
<p>
<b>Jawad Saleh:</b> This will help a great deal, really.
