When, in June 2008, Israel and the Hamas movement agreed through Egyptian mediation on a six-month ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, many expected that it would be short-lived. It was assumed the ceasefire would be fragile because of the high lev el of mutual distrust and because it would be difficult to maintain calm in the Gaza Strip while in the West Bank fighting continues. Nevertheless, so far the ceasefire seems stable; there are a few violations by armed actors that do not belong to Hamas but the movement is making great efforts to reign in these rogue elements. Since Hamas succeeded in late July to further strengthen its hold over the Gaza Strip, the movement has been able to enforce the ceasefire even more effectively.<P>

The understandings that enabled the ceasefire included two additional issues--accelerated negotiations on a prisoner exchange and the opening of the Gaza crossings to Israel and Egypt. Here the picture is less rosy. Negotiations over the exchange of Corporal Gilad Shalit for Palestinian prisoners are stumbling and no quick conclusion is expected. The crossings to Israel are open only partially, allowing limited quantities of goods to enter Gaza and almost no export. The Rafah crossing to Egypt is closed most of the time because Cairo is conditioning its opening on progress toward a prisoner exchange.<P>

Some Palestinian observers, close to the Palestinian Authority, suspect that Israel has actually begun to engage Hamas and that, because this will strengthen that movement it will quite naturally take place at the expense of President Mahmoud Abbas and the Salam Fayyad government in the West Bank. Is this really the case? How can these recent developments be interpreted?<P>

Probably the best way to understand these events is by borrowing a term from the world of computers: WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). What we see is a combination of Israeli steps that, taken together, do not make sense. They appear to be not parts of a comprehensive strategy but rather separate decisions that at times contradict one another. For example, if Israel has decided to engage Hamas, why is it dragging its feet on the prisoner exchange and the crossings issues?<P>

The reason appears to be an Israeli decision to cling to the strategy that was adopted after Hamas took over Gaza a year ago, even though realities on the ground demonstrate that this strategy is not really serving Israel's strategic interests vis-a-vis the Palestinians and, indeed, is forcing Israel to take steps that contradict it. <P>

According to the strategy chosen by Jerusalem, Israel will strengthen its peace partners in the West Bank and weaken Hamas, the enemy of peace, in the Gaza Strip. The first half of this formula was supposed to be accomplished through a combination of a political process, Annapolis, that provides the Palestinians with political horizons, steps on the ground that improve living conditions and the economic situation in the West Bank and a build-up of the PA's security organs. The second half would be a combination of military pressure and economic pressure to be achieved by closing the crossings.<P>

The problem is that this strategy is failing. The chance that the two parties will prove capable of concluding an agreement before the end of this year is slim. Living conditions in the West Bank are improving but not dramatically, due to the tension between what is needed to enable more freedom of movement there and Israel's security needs as long as there is no ceasefire in the West Bank. And there are some modest achievements in the reform and build-up of the PA's security arm, but this is a slow process. <P>

The end result is the further weakening of Abbas and the Fayyad government. Hamas has been hurt by pressure in the Gaza Strip and West Bank but this has not decreased its political support substantially and did not prevent it from strengthening its hold over Gaza. There, the ceasefire understandings have to some extent relaxed economic pressures, and the conclusion of a prisoner exchange would bolster Hamas even more. The only immediate achievement, the ceasefire that has enabled Israelis living on the periphery of the Gaza Strip to lead normal and quiet lives, might also collapse in December when Hamas has to decide whether to extend it even though its expectations for a full opening of the crossings have not been fulfilled. <P>

This situation should lead Israel's government to reconfigure its strategy so as to comprise three elements: continuation of efforts to strengthen the Abbas and Fayyad government, support for a Palestinian national dialogue that might lead to reconciliation between the two rival political movements,, and Israeli engagement of Hamas. This combination would better serve the interests of the two peoples and create strong motivation on both sides to maintain calm and stability. But Israel is not there yet.- <i>Published 22/9/2008 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
