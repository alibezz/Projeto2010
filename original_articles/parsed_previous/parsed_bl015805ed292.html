<b>bitterlemons:</b> How will Hamas' military strategy change after the Israeli withdrawal ?<P>

<b>Abu Shamala:</b> The Israeli withdrawal will not affect the situation. Instead, maybe it will encourage people to become more active. Gaza is not the last station, and we have to continue to work until we free all of Palestine.<P>

Perhaps the focus will now shift to the West Bank. But in Gaza we will not stay silent if there is continued aggression against Palestinians by the Israeli occupation forces.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you consider the withdrawal a victory for the armed resistance alone, or is it a combination of things?

<b>Abu Shamala:</b> The withdrawal is the fruit of the armed struggle and the patience of the people only. This is not the result of any political negotiations. The Palestinian Authority spent 10 years negotiating with Israel and got nothing. Look also at what happened in South Lebanon, where military resistance pushed Israel out. The same thing has happened here.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you think in the future, the Palestinian strategy should only be military?<P>

<b>Abu Shamala:</b> We see that military action is the only way to get our rights from Israel. If political negotiations are fruitful, then OK. But our experience with Israel, especially after the long process of negotiations from which we got nothing and reached a dead end, leads us to conclude that we have to depend on the military strategy.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> There seems to have been a decision recently not to engage in rocket or mortar attacks. Is that correct?<P>

<b>Abu Shamala:</b> We are interested that the withdrawal be completed. We are not interested in creating any trouble or obstacles in the way of this. We want to rid Gaza of the occupation. But we have many issues. There is the issue of prisoners, for instance. Also, we believe Sharon did what he did so he could keep the West Bank and the settlements there. We cannot trust Israel and we cannot put all our eggs in one basket. We have to look at the interests of our people.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How do you respond to President Mahmoud Abbas' recent statement that there should be one authority and one weapon?<P>

<b>Abu Shamala:</b> We are not a second authority here and we do not want to take the place of the PA. But we are a liberation movement--we fight for our people and we fight for Palestine--and because of this we will keep our weapons.  We will not compromise on this point. What is liberated now is only a very small part of Palestine, and we have to continue. <P>

Furthermore, Hamas keeps its weapons aimed at the occupation and doesn't use them in the streets or against other Palestinians, like other factions have done. We have to continue military action against Israel and therefore we have to keep these weapons in our hands.<P>

The Cairo Understandings also gave us the right to react to any Israeli aggression. Hamas agrees with this position, and Hamas has recorded many Israeli violations against our people. It is our right to fight against the occupation and to react against these crimes and aggressions. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> But do, for instance, mortar attacks, as some suggest, ultimately hurt Palestinians more than they hurt the Israelis?<P>

<b>Abu Shamala:</b> No. Yes, we pay a price, but that is the price of liberation. But Israel has been pushed out of Gaza because of these rockets and mortars. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> You say the Israeli withdrawal is an achievement for the armed resistance in Gaza. Can the armed resistance achieve the same in the West Bank?<P>

<b>Abu Shamala:</b> I hope the same thing will happen in the West Bank. I hope that by continuous struggle and armed resistance and military operations against settlers and soldiers, Israel will leave the West Bank. We know that Israel will eventually leave the West Bank, even if it takes time. Resistance is at the heart of the Palestinian people; it is a Palestinian way of life.-<i> Published 15/8/2005 (c) bitterlemons.org<P>
