an interview with Issam Makhoul

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How do you expect the various Arab parties in the Knesset, and your own party, the Communist party (which has Jewish and Arab representatives), to engage with the new Israeli government?<P>

<b>Makhoul:</b> We still don't have a body of work with which to judge this new government. We believe that the government of Ehud Olmert is a continuation of the government of Ariel Sharon--let us say that this government is "Sharonist" and without Sharon, it will be even more Sharon than he himself. We are witnessing policies that have depleted wheat in Gaza, continued the shooting in Nablus and Qabatiya, authorized more assassinations, and clearly has no interest in the political process.<P>

We believe that this government, through its policies and tendency toward unilateralism, is trying to dismiss the Palestinian people from a fair solution. It wants the Palestinian people to engage in the struggle, and not in the solution. We reject this attempt completely.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> It is fair to say that in the coming days, the government will engage issues deeply touching the lives of Palestinians citizens of Israel. First of all, there is the issue of the citizenship law.<P>

<b>Makhoul:</b> The decision that was handed down by the High Court this last week legitimized the refusal of citizenship to the spouse of an Israeli citizen who is from the occupied territories. This is a law built on a kind of racism that Israel has never openly expressed before, in that it distinguishes clearly between the rights of the Israeli citizen and the Arab citizen. This is the first time that the High Court has legitimized a law that is racist at its core.<P>

This shows that "security" or "demography dangers" are more important in Israeli criteria than democracy. This law is not only a danger for the Arab citizen, but also for the country itself and its institutions. The creation of the citizenship law is the beginning of the creation of an apartheid regime, like that in South Africa, in a real way rather than merely comparatively. This battle is one that is joined, not only by Arabs, but also democratic Jews. Even the head of the court and four other judges criticized the majority decision, calling it "racist and dangerous". Later, the head of the court said he thought the law would fail [before the court] if it is extended.<P>

We will fight this on ever level, among the public and in legislation, and if there is not a clear decision [to rescind the law] by Israeli officials, then we will fight it in the courts outside this country. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Another issue that this government will certainly face if it indeed tries to draw Israel's final borders is the idea that Israel's Palestinian citizens should be drawn out of the map.<P>

<b>Makhoul:</b> This idea comes right out of hell and the most racist and fundamentalist minds. It is to say that the Arab citizens are a danger to demography, and thus they should be stripped of their citizenship. We say, we did not come here as immigrants, Israel immigrated to us and was created on top of us. <P>

If Israeli had been created in Uganda as was suggested, then we would not be demanding citizenship from this state, but because the state of Israel was created in the Triangle, in the Galilee, and in the Negev, we are defending our citizenship rights in our country. We will not accept any solution that tries to change the borders to get rid of half a million Palestinians in Israel. We are a part of the Palestinian people, but our presence in these areas is part of the solution of the June 4, 1967 borders. These borders are not the core of the Palestinian-Israeli problem, but they are a chance for a solution. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Can you speak some about the problems that are faced by the Bedouin in the Negev, where they are under new pressure to leave their lands?<P>

<b>Makhoul:</b> There are some 70,000-80,000 Bedouin citizens in the Negev who were living on their land for tens of years before the creation of Israel. Israel was established and drew maps that did not show these communities, and to this day Israel acts as if these communities do not exist. Israel does not provide them with water, electricity, roads or schools and as such is forcing them to live as people lived 100 years ago.<P> 

There is now an escalation of the situation, as Israel is trying to force them from their land, and is annulling the evidence that they have that this is their land and was passed down from generations, in order to pass the land to Jewish ownership. They are creating settlements of 5,000 dunams, for example, and establishing on them dog pounds and animal preserves. The state is even creating Jewish settlements for one person alone. The government has sprayed poisonous chemicals on the Bedouin's lands, in order that they can no longer live there. <P>

These people are living in fear of destruction, and there is a new effort to get them to move from their lands to towns and cities to live on a dunam or half a dunam, despite their custom of living in open spaces.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is there any addition issue of importance that we didn't touch on?<P>

<b>Makhoul:</b> I would like to say to the Palestinian people [in the West Bank and Gaza] to take care of each other, and don't allow the Israeli occupation to generate problems and divide you, especially in Gaza. There is a need for a democratic force on the ground, which distances itself from divisions and corruption and can fight the battle against racism, in order to implement a just peace and the rights of the Palestinian people.- <i>Published 22/5/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org
