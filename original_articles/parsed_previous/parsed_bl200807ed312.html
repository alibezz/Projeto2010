an interview with Khalida Jarrar

</table><p>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Does the possibility of an autumn meeting as proposed by the United States give you cause for optimism?<P>

<b>Jarrar:</b> No, it does not. What is being proposed is only an international meeting rather than an international conference. Such a meeting will lead us back to the kind of mechanism we have had before where we do not discuss the fundamental issues. Discussing the Palestinian issue should be done at an international conference under the umbrella of the United Nations, not the United States. <P>

I don't think this meeting bears any relation to the central issue of ending the occupation. As far as I understand, it will only discuss how to strengthen the Palestinian Authority. That is its aim and it will take us back to the circle we went around 13 years ago.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What then is the purpose of the meeting?<P>

<b>Jarrar:</b> The purpose is related to American policy across the region whether in Iraq, Lebanon or Palestine. Iraq is being divided along sectarian lines, in Lebanon a similar policy is being pursued but with different tools, and in Palestine too there is this divide and conquer policy.<P>

I don't think this meeting will lead to a political process because such a process needs a framework and the framework is not clear. The US is focusing only on security and economic issues and there is no provision for an end of occupation.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is there any advantage for the Palestinian side to attend this meeting then?<P>

<b>Jarrar:</b> In my opinion there is none. But for those who are still happy to talk about two states without talking about the content of those two states, there will be. Some think that the mechanism of Oslo, which is what this meeting essentially reprises, still provides an opportunity to end the occupation. Experience, however, shows that we need to review the kind of mechanism needed to end the occupation.<P>

That is why I think we need an international conference under the UN in order to apply pressure to implement international resolutions. But I do understand the weakness of the Palestinian side at the moment, especially after Oslo, the internal Palestinian fighting and the division between the West Bank and Gaza.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Does this division not mitigate against attending such a meeting?<P>

<b>Jarrar:</b> There is no unified Palestinian position at the moment. Some are willing to enter into this kind of process and others are not. The democratic mechanism, and the only mechanism to solve this problem, is to undertake a political review through the Palestinian institutions over how best to proceed to end the occupation and preserve Palestinian national rights: self-determination, the right of return and the establishment of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> But in order to undertake such a review, there first needs to be dialogue between Hamas and Fateh, does there not?<P>

<b>Jarrar:</b> Not only between Fateh and Hamas, there needs to be a national dialogue among all the factions, a tool whereby Palestinians can discuss and reaffirm a unified program. We already have a program, the three points I mentioned earlier, but we need to reaffirm this program and decide who is not following it and what mechanisms will not lead us to those aims. I think the mechanism that some Palestinians are willing to follow will not lead to the fulfillment of these three conditions.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> So there will be no progress until Palestinians sort out their own internal divisions?<P>

<b>Jarrar:</b> We cannot follow any mechanism without a united Palestinian position. We have already had experience of the mechanism of individual negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis under the umbrella of the US. I don't think the US has any political program to put an end to the occupation and uphold Palestinian rights. There is no content to [US President George W.] Bush's talk of support for a Palestinian state. The state is not the question. What will such a state look like, what about the right of self-determination and the right of return?- <i>Published 20/8/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
