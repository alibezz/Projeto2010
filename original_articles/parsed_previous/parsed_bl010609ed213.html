an interview with Ahmad Yousef
</table><p>
 

<p><b>bitterlemons:</b> There are many reports in the press that the Obama administration is pressuring Israel to stop building settlements. What is Hamas' reaction to this?
<p><b>Yousef:</b> I believe that Obama insists on this issue because it's the key to the two-state solution. If the Israelis don't stop their colonialism, then the principle [of two states] will no longer exist. The Obama administration is serious about this, because it is the minimum that Obama can use to convince the Arab world--otherwise the entire Palestinian cause is dead. 
<p><b>bitterlemons:</b> When Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met with US President Obama in Washington, he presented an initiative, one that hasn't been described publicly yet. Is Hamas aware of its points, and what is Hamas' reaction to these?
<p><b>Yousef:</b> No matter what the details of this initiative, as long as it wasn't proposed and discussed by all of the Palestinian factions, it represents the vision of Abbas or [Palestinian negotiator Yasser] Abed Rabbo and is completely rejected by all of the factions, including Fateh and Hamas. 
<p>As far as I know, the initiative includes a renunciation of the [Palestinian refugees'] right of return. Abbas confirmed in his initiative that he does not insist on the right of return for all Palestinians, but rather only some of them. This is completely rejected by all Palestinians. 
<p><b>bitterlemons:</b> Three of Hamas' fighters in the West Bank were recently killed, one by Israeli forces and two by the Palestinian police. How does Hamas view these developments, particularly concerning the Ramallah government? At what time will Hamas end its policy of not directly confronting security forces in the West Bank?
<p><b>Yousef:</b> I believe what happened yesterday is a blow to the dialogue project in Cairo. The scene yesterday reminds the public of the chaos that the Palestinian security forces used to implement in Gaza before Hamas' takeover. The coordination between Palestinian security and the Israeli occupation is shameful and not at all acceptable. The Palestinian Authority in Ramallah considers it honorable but the people reject it. Targeting the Palestinian resistance on behalf of the enemy is a black mark in the history of Abbas, and [Palestinian Prime Minister Salam] Fayyad as well. In addition, what happened will enhance the separation of Gaza and Ramallah. 
<p>I believe every fighter wanted by the occupation has the right to resist arrest. Unfortunately, the security apparatuses in the West Bank are collaborating with the occupation against Palestinian resistance groups--either by arresting them, torturing them or assassinating them. Therefore, every fighter has the right to protect himself by any means and resist the arrest. 
<p>It's unbelievable that the wanted Palestinian fighter who fights the occupation then becomes wanted and targeted by Palestinian security, which should instead help and protect him.
<p><b>bitterlemons:</b> How can the Obama administration positively impact the dialogue in Cairo? Or is this impossible as long as the three Quartet demands--that Hamas renounce violence, accept the Oslo accords, and recognize Israel--are in place?
<p><b>Yousef:</b> Obama's administration can play a very important and effective rule in the reconciliation process in Cairo. This could happen if [the Americans] send positive signals to the Egyptians, asking them to encourage the dialogue. Also, Obama can ask Abbas to accept dialogue without pre-conditions, so that it moves faster and is more meaningful. 
<p>The Quartet conditions will not help reconciliation. We have said many times that nobody has the right to decide the future of Palestinians on their behalf, and that the international community should have accepted the results of the last Palestinian legislative elections. But if these conditions are still there, then this means that Obama's administration is not serious in solving the conflict--neither the internal one nor that with the Israelis. 
<p>Any move to solve the conflict and find a solution cannot be achieved without dealing with Hamas in any forthcoming political formulation because this is the choice of the Palestinian people.  
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> The Obama administration appears to be trying to engage the Islamic world instead of engaging the usual Arab leaders. How does Hamas view this perspective? Can it bring progress in the peace process?
<p>
<b>Yousef:</b> This reconciliation must be conducted with the Muslim nations, not only with their leaders. These nations need to hear new language different from the language of threats used by [former US President George W.] Bush against the Muslim world. Obama must declare an end to these threats and announce the beginning of a new relationship with the Muslim world. He must work on changing the ugly face of America. 
<p>
On the other hand, the Palestinian cause lies at the heart of all issues in the Muslim and Arab world. To achieve reconciliation, Obama must work to solve this issue and find a just solution based on the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital. - <i>Published 1/6/2009 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
