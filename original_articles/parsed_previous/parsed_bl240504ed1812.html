
a conversation with Haidar Abdel Shafi

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What do you think the incursions and demolitions in Rafah have to do with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to withdraw from Gaza, if anything?
<p>
<b>Abdel Shafi:</b> I think that Sharon has distinguished himself in being very, very brutal and inconsiderate of human rights principles. What is happening in Rafah is only in line with his general performance.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> As a veteran advocate for the Palestinian cause, what are your observations about what is happening in Rafah?
<p>
<b>Abdel Shafi:</b> Our position is very clear. We have adopted a conciliatory position by asking for a Palestinian state on one-fourth of historic Palestine. Still, this is opposed and not respected by the Israeli side. You can imagine how one might describe this Israeli position. 
<p>
I know that Zionism claimed all of Palestine, but I think that it is high time that Palestinian rights in Palestine are recognized. Our conciliatory position is proof that we are sincere in [attempts] to realize a needed peace between the two communities. This is being neglected and Sharon is having his way in brutalizing the Palestinian people in the hope that they will succumb and abandon their rights. 
<p>
I know that our performance is not very organized. I know that we commit mistakes. I don't agree with suicide actions on our part, but Israel is doing something similar with its aerial bombardments. They target one person, and then kill several people standing beside him. This is just as bad as the suicide acts committed by the Islamists.
<p>
Israel's performance is far from showing commitment to peace principles, to international principles, and it is high time that the objective of peace is given more consideration and more sincerity.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Have you given up hope on the intervention of the international community?
<p>
<b>Abdel Shafi:</b> No. I am sorry that the international community is adopting a very passive ineffectual position, but still I hope that it will wake up to its responsibilities and not just stand by and watch.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What can you say about the relationship between United States President George W. Bush and Sharon and its impact on the conflict?
<p>
<b>Abdel Shafi:</b> I am very unhappy with the Bush performance. I don't know how informed he is about the [Palestinian] problem and its historic background. It seems to me that Bush's actions do not indicate that he is very well informed about the realities of the problem. He is very involved in his career and his future. Certainly, this has terrible repercussions.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you see a way in which Palestinians can make the best of this situation?
<p>
<b>Abdel Shafi:</b> I think there is much that can be done. The Palestinians have been acting without even the slightest organization. One of the weaknesses of Palestinians is that they are very emotional, and this at times works against their interests. We have to be more organized, less emotional and really see things objectively--and act objectively. Much of what we do deprives us of the support of the international community. We have been suffering such terrible injustice, and our performance deprives us of the needed sympathy.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Did anything surprise you about what happened in Rafah?
<p>
<b>Abdel Shafi:</b> I would be the first to admit that we often do things that we should not do. We commit mistakes. But exploiting that, as Sharon is doing, is brutal.
