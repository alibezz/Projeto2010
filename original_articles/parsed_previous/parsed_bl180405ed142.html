
an interview with Avi Farhan

</table>
<p>
 <b>bitterlemons:</b> Why do you want to remain in the Gaza Strip after disengagement?
<p>
<b>Farhan:</b> I was expelled from Tripoli, Libya with my family at age three. I grew up in an Israeli refugee camp near Tel Aviv. I was one of the first settlers of Yamit, in Sinai, in 1975, and the last to leave in 1982. At the time, I led a protest march from Yamit to Jerusalem and intended to set up a refugee camp near the Erez junction, because I felt once again like a refugee. Minister of Defense Ariel Sharon suggested that instead I establish a settlement near Erez, Alei Sinai, in the northern Gaza Strip. From Dugit in the west to Nitzanit in the east, this was virgin territory that prior to 1956 was a UN-held demilitarized zone. We didn't displace anyone.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How is this personal history relevant to your request to remain in the Gaza Strip? 
<p>
<b>Farhan:</b> I've been a refugee twice already. I don't want to again be an exile in my land. In the framework of real peace--not a worthless piece of paper like we have with Egypt--we can go 100 years back and 100 years forward and think about the million Jews who fled Arab countries decades ago. In a meeting with Mohammed Dahlan four or five years ago, I told him that we're not afraid of the Arabs, we understand their mentality and can be a real bridge to peace. We can build a Garden of Eden together, a riviera from Ashkelon down to Sinai. Dahlan said I could stay if I agree to be a Palestinian citizen, and I replied "you're not threatening me; if I have the right to vote I'm likely to be elected before you".
<p>
I lived with Arabs in Yamit, where I was Israel Ministry of Agriculture representative in el Arish. I've served in the IDF military government. In Alei Sinai I was part of a fishing cooperative in which Gazans held 75 percent.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> We're talking about you remaining not under conditions of peace, but in a few months, after disengagement.
<p>
<b>Farhan:</b> If Member of Knesset Ahmed Tibi's family can live in Taibeh [an Arab town in Israel] and Tibi can serve in the Knesset and be Arafat's advisor, there is no reason why Avi Farhan can't stay in peace in Alei Sinai, be a Palestinian citizen and perhaps be an advisor to Ariel Sharon.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Are others in Alei Sinai interested in your idea?
<p>
<b>Farhan:</b> We are seven families, with more showing interest.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Have you discussed the legal and security conditions with PA/PLO authorities?
<p>
<b>Farhan:</b> No. There are some initial feelers from Palestinians, but no official contact.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How do you plan to deal with possible Palestinian claims to the land you live on, demands to apply Palestinian law to you, to move into empty houses in Alei Sinai, perhaps attempts to hurt you physically?
<p>
<b>Farhan:</b> I haven't gone into those issues. I suggest to the Palestinians that they see the positive aspect of this idea. From their standpoint, even if I live in Jaffa or work at Tel Aviv University I'm on Palestinian land, while for my part I can raise ownership demands on lands back in Libya and Yemen and Egypt and we'll all continue to wallow in the mud. As for the pragmatic issues such as ownership, we'll solve them when we get to them. The new Palestinian leadership, which looks to the West, would be shooting itself in the foot if it didn't recognize its interest in guaranteeing my security. I'm aware of the dangers.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you need permission from the government of Israel to stay behind?
<p>
<b>Farhan:</b> I raised the issue with the Knesset Judicial Committee. I said I don't want to be an exile in my own land. Several members of Knesset supported me. Meanwhile PM Sharon's timetable is not sacrosanct. And I oppose destruction of the settlers' houses; that's an act of war.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What's your next step?
<p>
<b>Farhan:</b> I've been approached by an Israeli rabbinic authority that has links with the Palestinians and by a well-known Israeli journalist who tried to get me together with a senior Palestinian, but unfortunately our security establishment wouldn't let the Palestinian visit me.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Many Israelis would say you're not realistic. Do you know a single Israeli who has opted to live in Egypt or Jordan, Arab countries at peace with Israel?
<p>
<b>Farhan:</b> I don't even know an Israeli Jew who has opted to live in an Israeli Arab village, other than women who have married villagers and become Muslim, though there are some Israeli Arabs living in Jewish towns. We all have to "reprogram" ourselves. This is a test for the Palestinians. With all the pain and the risk, I'm prepared to be the guinea pig. If they fail, they will fail the test of the democratic world that is trying to pull them into the 21st century. It's in their interest more than mine.- <i>Published 18/4/2005 (c) bitterlemons.org</i>
