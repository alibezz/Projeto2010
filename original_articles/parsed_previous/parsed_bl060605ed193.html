<b>bitterlemons:</b> What exactly are the differences between the 1949 armistice lines and the 1967 lines? US President George W. Bush recently emphasized the former.
  <p>
<b>Abed:</b>Armistice lines are not internationally recognized border lines, they are temporary ceasefire lines. There were changes to the armistice lines in 1949 and 1952 in agreements between Israel and Jordan. An armistice line remains a temporary line until final negotiations decide internationally recognized borders, which will happen when two parties present an agreement to the UN and the international community accepts it. This did not happen in 1949 or in 1952, and changes to the armistice lines were simply bilateral agreements between Jordan and Israel.
  <p>
I think the reason this is being brought up now is to tell the world that the wall Israel is building is another armistice line. If you listen to what the Israelis and other states are saying, that the wall will not be a final border but is only temporary, it sounds like just another armistice line.
  <p>
So this is one way of reinterpreting the route of the wall as a new armistice line with the final border to be settled in negotiations. How long negotiations will take and when they will start is another matter. But this is all, in my opinion, in order to make the wall acceptable as a new armistice line.
  <p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What would the political significance be if the wall became a new armistice line?
  <p>
<b>Abed:</b>Politically it would mean we could not do anything about the wall until final status negotiations. It will be recognized by the rest of the world as a temporary line or an armistice line and that will serve to neutralize the finding of the International Court of Justice that the wall is illegal and should be removed.
  <p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What effect will that have on final status negotiations, then? Will this be the new line everybody will talk about?
  <p>
<b>Abed:</b>When you create new facts on the ground you make it difficult for negotiations to succeed, in this case, to remove that new line and go back to the 1967 line. In addition, look at the problems in removing a few settlers here and there. What about the settlement blocs? Negotiations are being hampered at every turn.
  <p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How do the 1949 armistice lines affect the Gaza withdrawal?
  <p>
<b>Abed:</b>This is another part of this new concept of unilateralism that the Israelis are trying to adopt for the whole process. The withdrawal from Gaza is a unilateral act, meaning Israel will take what it wants, and at the same time remain as a partner in what is left.
  <p>
This unilateralism is also evidenced by this new armistice line they are drawing around Gaza and the West Bank. They will say this is not a final border, it is still up to final negotiations but the time is not right for such negotiations.
  <p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> In terms of land, the 1949 armistice lines include demilitarized zones. What is their significance?
  <p>
<b>Abed:</b>If you look back and see the demilitarized zones especially around Jerusalem and Latroun and also around Gaza, there is a difference between the armistice line and the demilitarized zone. In Gaza this difference is about two kilometers north of the Erez Crossing.
  <p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> So, in the Gaza case, if Bush is talking about the 1949 armistice line, and the actual line is two kilometers north of Erez, this would be an advantage for the Palestinian side?
  <p>
<b>Abed:</b>It would be an advantage on one side and a disadvantage on the other. In the south east of the Gaza border there are two towns that should be part of Israel.
  <p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why bring in the 1949 lines at all. It sounds like it just confuses matters?
  <p>
<b>Abed:</b>It does confuse matters, because everybody was talking about the 1967 border. But, as I say, I think this has to do with the wall and the 2004 Bush-Sharon understandings that talk about settlement blocs and Jerusalem. There are three dimensions: the first is about these Bush-Sharon understandings; secondly, it’s about the wall and third, emphasizing the 1949 armistice lines sends the signal that the border is a matter for negotiations and not a matter of legality or illegality.-<i> Published 6/5/2005 © bitterlemons.org</i>
