an interview with Eyad Sarraj
</table><p>
 

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What do you make of the Israeli demand that Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state?
<p>
<b>Sarraj:</b> I agree that Jews have rights in the Holy Land. But I don't think this religious condition for the Jewishness of the state is conducive to any hope for peace and reconciliation. On the contrary, it will further strengthen the antagonism and enmity between Jews and non-Jews in the area. 
<p>
We have seen an extremist Islamist reaction, not only in Palestine but elsewhere, to the establishment of Israel and the occupation. Israel's insistence on having a Jewish state, denying non-Jews their equal citizenship and rights, is a form of racism that can only lead to a future of violence and more discrimination. 
<p>
Israel is going down a path that is very dangerous, the same route as South Africa, of institutionalized racism and discrimination. But at the end of the day, it gives Palestinians and those who believe in human rights and justice in Israel and elsewhere more ammunition. Maybe we should thank the Israeli government for this. It may galvanize those opposed to racism to begin organizing a proper economic, academic and cultural boycott of Israel.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why did Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu come out with this condition now?
<p>
<b>Sarraj:</b> I think Netanyahu is just being true to himself. He believes that Jews have exclusive rights in Palestine. He never accepted the idea of any other state between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean. He never believed in ending the settlement project in the West Bank. And he never accepted any rights for non-Jews in Jerusalem. 
<p>
Now he is also armed with [Israeli foreign minister Avigdor] Lieberman, who is advocating that Palestinian citizens of Israel should leave. That fits well into Netanyahu's ideology.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b>  Is Israel growing more intolerant?
<p>
<b>Sarraj:</b> Israel is becoming xenophobic and is on a dangerous road to apartheid. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Some argue that Netanyahu stipulated this condition, simply as a way to head off apparent American pressure to engage in a serious peace process. Do you think there's some truth in that?
<p>
<b>Sarraj:</b> I think the tactic to divert the US is about Iran, that Iran is the threat to Middle East peace, not the settlements, not the Judaization of Jerusalem, not the ethnic cleansing, not the lack of recognition of a Palestinian state. Lieberman is going to Europe now to say that it is Iran that is the problem.
<p>
I think this tactic is a failure from the start.  But I think that Netanyahu and Lieberman are just being true to themselves. Of course they will try to bargain with the US, that if the US deals with Iran, then Israel will give Washington some space in a peace process. Yet at the end of the day, I think Netanyahu and Lieberman, like Shamir, simply want to negotiate with the Palestinians forever without giving them anything. 
<p>
Netanyahu wants time to pursue four projects at the same time: one is the Judaization of Jerusalem, which will not stop unless there is serious outside pressure. Then there is the continued colonization of the West Bank. Third, is to leave Gaza out of the whole equation and make it an Egyptian problem. Finally, is ethnic cleansing, to rid Israel of its non-Jews.
<p>
I think the Americans have realized that there is something wrong here. Hopefully Washington can stop all these projects before they lead to another war, which is very possible.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> PA President Mahmoud Abbas rejected Netanyahu's condition. Do you see any sign that such Israeli positions can unite the Palestinian side?
<p>
<b>Sarraj:</b> I think the Palestinians have proven to be their own worst enemies in so many ways over the years. The Israelis united the West Bank and Gaza in 1967 with the occupation. I don't think they will unite us again. For now, unity is a distant second priority to the power struggle between Hamas and Abbas.- <I>Published 4/5/2009 &copy; bitterlemons.org</I>
