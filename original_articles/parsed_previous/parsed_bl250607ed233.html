an interview with Abdel Jawad Saleh

</table><p>
  
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has promised to release funds to the Palestinian Authority. Will this strengthen Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas?<P>

<b>Saleh:</b> This depends on the results of the summit at Sharm al-Sheikh. If Olmert accepts to work toward ending the occupation, then yes. But if the money is really intended to bolster Abbas in order to fight Hamas, this could destroy Abbas.<P>

It's not a question of money; it's a question of the occupation.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What steps might Israel take to help Abbas?<P>

<b>Saleh:</b> Look, the American plan is nothing but an embellishment of the occupation. Removing the odd checkpoint here and there, or any other measure that does not attempt to solve the root of the conflict, is nothing but window dressing. After 40 years, it is time for this occupation to end and along with it all its appendages and measures.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Washington is now talking about easing checkpoints and releasing funds in order to  bolster Abbas vis-a-vis Hamas. Is this helpful?<P>

<b>Saleh:</b> Of course not. Abbas is now in his third year and at no time before has anyone tried to empower him. All Israeli steps until now were really meant to mock him, to show him up as a leader not capable of solving Palestinian grievances.<P>

The same thing happened when he was prime minister. When Yasser Arafat realized that the Americans were not really serious about helping him, he kicked Abbas out.<P>

If they want to help Abbas, they need to help the Palestinian people. And this can only really happen if there is a serious commitment to end the occupation. To this end, a proper timetable for the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza must be set.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is there not a danger that the more help Abbas receives from Washington and Israel the more likely he is to be seen as a collaborator among Palestinians?<P>

<b>Saleh:</b> Yes.  If the fruits of this summit are only a release of funds, it is clear that he will be seen only as a man who is ready to fight Hamas on behalf of the Israelis. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Does it make sense to isolate the Gaza Strip?<P>

<b>Saleh:</b> No. I wish Abbas had solved the problem in Gaza before going to this summit. He could have addressed Hamas and again made an attempt at building real institutions of state with Hamas, not as Hamas or Fateh, but institutions that serve the Palestinian people, to which people are hired on merit, not factional loyalties. <P>

These institutions must be based on the democratic process and there must be a clear-out of the dead wood. It is clear that when security leaders are receiving American money to fight Hamas there is a war of proxy taking place. <P>

There must be ways and means to rebuild not only the institutions but the atmosphere of the first intifada: a united people and volunteering and working for each other rather then for themselves.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> But the reality is almost the opposite. Abbas has fired the government and seems to have moved closer to Washington. Will these measures create a deeper split with Hamas?<P>

<b>Saleh:</b> People will look at Fateh as a proxy power in the hands of the Americans and Israelis. This will undermine Abbas' position. Every Palestinian is against internal fighting, because this will be our end.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> But Hamas did resort to violence to impose control. Even if they claimed they were punishing criminal gangs, they did not follow any judicial procedure. Is it not justified that some punitive measures are undertaken?<P>

<b>Saleh:</b> All people involved in these crimes from both sides have to be punished. There needs to be a neutral committee to investigate the whole story from the beginning. People responsible for leading our society into internal strife need to be put on trial and be punished.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Are you hopeful that now that money will flow into the PA things will at all improve?<P>

<b>Saleh:</b> Promises have been made so many times. US President George W. Bush said he would build a Palestinian state in five years. These were empty promises. Nothing will change now.- <i>Published 25/6/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
