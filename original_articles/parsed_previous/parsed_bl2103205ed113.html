Two years ago American President George W. Bush shattered the old familiar order that had existed in the Middle East for the past several decades. The United States struck a blow against Iraq, and the shock waves were felt over the Middle East. In the past month they reached Lebanon and Syria. It is indeed impossible to understand the recent dramatic events in Lebanon, and to a lesser extent in Syria, without reference to American support and encouragement. <p>

Events in Syria reflect the interaction of three factors. First is the weakness of the Syrian state and especially the weakness of the young and inexperienced president, Bashar al-Asad; this is clear to everyone both inside and outside Syria. Second is the low threshold of tolerance in Lebanon for the Syrians, which reached its nadir in the following the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, who had been identified more than anyone else with the reconstruction of the Lebanese state after the bloody civil war that raged there, and whose assassination was believed by many to have been Syria's handiwork. Finally, and most importantly, there was the pressure exerted by America and France on Syria to pull its troops out of Lebanon.<p>

It is still difficult to assess what the long-term implications of these events are likely to be for the Lebanese-Syrian arena. Could they ultimately lead to Lebanon's deterioration into another civil war or at least to a period of instability? Conversely, could they lead to the strengthening of its stability and economic development? Could they indeed strike a blow so serious to the stability of the Syrian regime that it poses a threat to the regime's existence?  It is still too early to assess what the future holds in store for this arena.<p>

It is also difficult to assess what the implications are for the Palestinian arena, and for Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations. Nevertheless, it is possible to indicate a number of points that require close attention. <p>

First, a boost of encouragement for Palestinian Authority Head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen): the dramatic events in Lebanon and Syria can undoubtedly bolster the moderate forces in the entire region and certainly on the Palestinian political scene. The defeat suffered by the radical forces, first and foremost the Syrian regime, has psychological implications for the whole region.<p> However, this defeat also has practical meaning, since under pressure from the West the Syrians may be expected to permanently close down the Hamas and Islamic Jihad offices in Damascus, thus further reducing those organizations' already limited maneuvering space. After all, now that Hizballah has adopted a softer and more moderate tone in its rhetoric, one cannot expect Hamas and Islamic Jihad to be "more Catholic than the Pope" in theirs. Thus the events in Lebanon have lent strength to Abu Mazen's standing and the path he follows.<p>

Second, encouragement for George W. Bush to become more personally involved in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations: not only Arab players but also American players have been sucked into the maelstrom created by recent events in Lebanon. American involvement in events there--indeed, the US readiness to play an active role in the Lebanese arena--grew as it became increasingly clear that Washington's efforts had proven successful. This dynamic will encourage, and indeed has already encouraged, President Bush to deepen his involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which he avoided like the plague during his first term in office.<p>

This involvement need not necessarily be one-sided, i.e., tilting toward Israel. Interesting voices are emanating from Washington, according to which the United States would be prepared to reconsider its attitude toward Hizballah if that organization disarms and drops its involvement in terror activities. These voices can be interpreted as an indication of flexibility of thought in the American administration and recognition of the limitations on US freedom of action in the region. These voices could possibly presage America's readiness in the future to adopt a more flexible position regarding Hamas if the latter continues to pursue its path toward becoming a political force.<p>

To sum up: the dramatic events in Lebanon have enhanced the impression that a striking change is taking place in the Middle East, thus strengthening the trend among the region's leaders to hitch themselves to the American wagon and not try to swim against the current. The latter comprise not only the head of the Palestinian Authority but also Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. <p>

Nevertheless, a word of caution is in order. Bush has succeeded in cracking, even smashing, the old order in the Middle East, and it will never be restored. However, from here to the emergence of a new order reflecting stability, economic prosperity and, primarily, commitment to the principles of democracy, there is a long way to go.- <i>Published 21/3/2005 (c) bitterlemons.org<P>
