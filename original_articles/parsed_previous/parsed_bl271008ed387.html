an interview with Ahmed Tibi

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What is the significance of the Arab-Jewish clashes in Acre earlier this month, in view of events since then?
<p>
<b>Tibi:</b> This was an expression of ongoing grievances in mixed towns and a direct result of absorbing settlers from Hebron and elsewhere in order to "Judaize" Acre, meaning expelling Arabs from the city or forcing them to move out. There is no secret here; this was declared by those rightist activists. We have said more than once that they should be confronted and the authorities should deal with them. I'm glad the disturbances were mainly in Acre, with only minor events in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. If nothing is done to bridge the gap between the Jewish majority and the Arab minority in these mixed towns, we will witness more clashes. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Has the publication during the past two years of Israeli Arab manifestos calling for Israel effectively to become a bi-national state affected Arab-Jewish coexistence in Israel? 
<p>
<b>Tibi:</b> We don't want a bi-national state exactly, but Israelis cannot ignore the Arab nationality in Israel. We demand to be a national minority but the Jewish majority refuses to discuss this. Mixed cities in Israel are a good example of how Arab citizens are being treated in a discriminatory way. Visit a Jewish neighborhood, then visit an Arab neighborhood and witness the huge gap in infrastructure. Israel cannot claim to be a democracy with this disparity between citizens of the same country. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Can you factor into your description of the situation the latest failure to reach a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians? 
<p>
<b>Tibi:</b> The deadlock in the negotiating process provides the setting for enlarging the gap between Jews and Arabs [inside Israel]. We agree that the two-state solution is the ultimate solution. But Israel is in love with the process much more than the peace. It is creating more and more obstacles to peace, such as settlements and the apartheid wall. You cannot reject both a two-state solution and alternative options: this will lead to a South African situation.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> In the aftermath of Acre and in the course of her coalition-building efforts, did Kadima leader Tzipi Livni consult with you or the other nine members of Knesset from the Arab parties?
<p>
<b>Tibi:</b> Livni considers the Knesset as composed of only 110 MKs and not 120. The 10 Arab MKs are being neglected and sent an outrageous message by Livni: that the Arab parties will not be a part of the legitimate decision-making process; that we are discriminating against you and your elected leadership. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How will Arab-Jewish relations in Israel play out in the coming elections?
<p>
<b>Tibi:</b> This will be an important issue, especially since [MK Avigdor] Lieberman and his [Yisrael Beitenu] party and others may put this issue in their platform, describing the Arab minority as a fifth column that endangers the future of the state of Israel and trying to keep some Arabs from being eligible to be elected.-<i> Published 27/10/2008 &copy; bitterlemons.org </i>
