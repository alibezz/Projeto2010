an interview with Ghazi Hamad
</table><p>

 




<b>bitterlemons:</b> Reconciliation talks started in Cairo last week. They seem serious. Do you agree?
<p>
<b>Hamad:</b> Yes. I've heard from both Hamas and Fateh leaders that this time everyone is prepared for real change. Their message is, enough to the division, enough to hatred and time to turn the page. No one is out of the domestic crisis and no one is free of the dilemma it poses. The factions need each other and they know they have to work together.
<p>
So, I've seen positive signals from both sides and I think the decision to set up committees is a good start that can take the dialogue further.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is it too early to say if there is good momentum?
<p>
<b>Hamad:</b> So far, they have only agreed on the outline of discussions. But I think this outline is important and I believe them when they say they are ready to start a new era in relations. The committees have timetables for their work and they will come back again and discuss all issues. I hope this will receive proper follow-up.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why now? A few months ago Hamas refused to go to similar talks. What changed?
<p>
<b>Hamad:</b> There are a few factors. One is the war on Gaza. After that war, I think people feel that the time had come to change the domestic situation. Also, the victory of the rightwing in Israel has changed the dynamics. 
<p>
But everything is still open. Sometimes the atmosphere is good, sometimes bad. I can only tell you that throughout all this time there have been contacts between Hamas and Fateh. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> We've seen several prominent western politicians come to Gaza in recent weeks. Has this had an effect?
<p>
<b>Hamad:</b> I think both factions have started to think harder about domestic relations and how they affect foreign relations. Arab countries have been sending messages that it is shameful for Palestinians to maintain their divisions, and I think both Hamas and Fateh genuinely want this dialogue. This may be a moment when there is a good chance of success and Egypt has been working very hard to make this a reality.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is there a lot of Arab pressure?
<p>
<b>Hamad:</b> I wouldn't call it pressure, though certainly the advice from all quarters is that unity is to the benefit of the Palestinian people. But many factors contributed to these talks. This is a process that has been ongoing for over a year. But especially after the war on Gaza, both factions seem to have understood that if Palestinian blood does not unite them, nothing will.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What about the reconstruction of Gaza. How important is unity for that?
<p>
<b>Hamad:</b> Until now there is no clear plan. But any money for reconstruction must not be politicized or be used to create more problems for Palestinians. I think the Hamas position is clear. Money for reconstruction will not go to Hamas or the government [in Gaza]. It has to go to the Palestinian people. So we have called for an independent professional committee to be in charge of reconstruction. The government will not interfere other than to make sure that the mechanism benefits the people who need it.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> There cannot be any reconstruction unless the Gaza crossings are open. Any progress on that front?
<p>
<b>Hamad:</b> No, not yet. There are no promises and nothing concrete to give us hope that the crossings will be opened properly.-<i> Published 2/3/2009 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
