The Riyadh Arab summit presents an important opportunity for Arab countries: to strengthen a pragmatic coalition capable of confronting extremism in the Arab world, recommitting to the Arab peace initiative and advancing regional peace processes. <P>

The new Quartet, comprising Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, is now recognized and encouraged by the rest of the world; witness the meeting just held between US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and leaders of the four states. The veteran Quartet made up of the UN, US, Russia and the EU functions on the basis of the lowest common denominator and generates more paralysis than new initiatives. In contrast, the new Quartet is likely to be more active, if only because it is acting on the basis of an egotistical but legitimate concern for the survival of its member regimes. Having concluded that in order to save themselves they must make a supreme effort to bring peace and stability to the Middle East, these leaders are likely to surprise us with their readiness to lead in directions where hitherto none had dared to venture.
<P>
I well remember a conversation with President Anwar Sadat that took place between the Camp David agreements of autumn 1978 and the Israeli-Egyptian peace pact signed in March 1979. I asked him which Arab state would be the second to make peace with Israel and he replied without hesitation, "Saudi Arabia". It was a bad mistake. The Saudis linked up with other Arab countries that resolutely opposed the agreement with Israel and lent a hand in boycotting Egypt, expelling it from the Arab League and moving the League's headquarters from Cairo to Tunis.<P>

The Saudi initiative of March 2002 is the most far-reaching change in Saudi policy since those Camp David agreements. It constitutes a total reversal of the "three nos" of the September 1967 Khartoum Arab summit and reflects both the Saudi response to the events of 9/11 and the emergence of King Abdullah--even when he served as crown prince while his brother, the king, was effectively neutralized due to health problems. Now that Abdullah is king in his own right, he is initiating striking political moves like the Mecca summit, where he compelled Hamas and Fateh to form a national unity government. Anyone seeking to promote regional stability must recognize the positive nature of Abdullah's activities; we have been awaiting them ever since Sadat offered his assessment of the future Saudi role.<P>

Undoubtedly, the situation we have found ourselves in since late 2000 is to a large extent the antithesis of the sense of diplomatic progress that characterized the 1990s. The failure of talks between Israel and Syria and Israel and the Palestinians, the outbreak of the second intifada, 9/11, the Iranian nuclear threat, the Hamas electoral victory--all these developments reversed our course, yet also generated a positive counter-reaction. <P>

One of the more encouraging aspects of that counter-reaction has been the Arab League's response to the al-Qaeda phenomenon and the Iranian nuclear threat. Now, the establishment of a Palestinian unity government conveys a chance to create the unified Palestinian partner that we have long sought. Our attitude toward the new government must be determined by its performance rather than its composition or guidelines, problematic as they are. <P>

If the new government succeeds in preventing any and all violence against Israel in accordance with a ceasefire in Gaza and the West Bank; if it brings about the release of Gilad Shalit; if it enables the PLO led by Mahmoud Abbas to manage diplomatic negotiations with Israel--then it will be fitting for the world to recognize it. At that point, it will also be possible to interpret the new government's guidelines in a more liberal manner, transfer aid funds to it and maintain normal contacts with it. Meanwhile, it would be a serious mistake to boycott those members of this government who for years have been committed to peace with Israel and who have made serious efforts to end terrorism and violence.<P>

Recent events--the return to the Arab peace plan, the new Quartet, the Mecca summit, the establishment of a Palestinian unity government and the approaching Arab summit--all convey a new hope. That hope can be realized if we don't all repeat the mistakes of the past, and in particular if we don't perpetuate the mistake that for so many years has characterized all the regional and international actors: missing most of the opportunities.- <i>Published 26/3/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
