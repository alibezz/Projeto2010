an interview with Ghazi Hamad

</table><p>
  

<b>bitterlemons:</b> There has been talk about diplomatic horizons from the US and Israel. If a final outcome were discussed first, would this constitute a positive development?<P>

<b>Hamad:</b> The political track has different branches and different directions. Sometimes people refer to the Oslo agreements, sometimes the roadmap or the Arab initiative and so on. <P>

In Hamas we have already presented an outline. It is wide and flexible. First, we are not against political compromise or a political solution. We have put the Palestinian demands very clearly: a Palestinian state on 1967 borders, the right of return and so on. It is in line with the Prisoners' Document.<P>

We have also clearly stated that the political file is the responsibility of the PLO and President Mahmoud Abbas is the head of the PLO. He has committed the PLO to political agreements. We have discussed the Arab initiative and international legality. <P>

We are the government and we will not put obstacles in the way of President Abbas to negotiate with Israel and to continue the peace process. We only have one condition: when he wants to sign an agreement, he should go back to the Legislative Council. <P>

Our program for the unity government is very flexible and it opens the way for any political process, if it is appropriate. We can apply different titles and different addresses, but if you put them all together one thing is necessary for a political process: that there are good and serious intentions to do something to help the Palestinians.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Can a diplomatic horizon be created for as long as sanctions continue against the Palestinian Authority?<P>

<b>Hamad:</b> We have had discussion with representatives of some European countries. There have been some good developments and I think their position is different now than in the past. <P>

But the international community has only imposed conditions on the one side, the Palestinian side. What about Israel? Israel is against returning to the 1967 borders. It is against the right of return. Israel is against removing its settlements from the West Bank. It refuses to recognize our rights to Jerusalem. Until now, there has been no clear statement from Israel on all these issues. So why are conditions imposed only on the Palestinian people?<P>

Recognition is between two states. We are not a state. We are not a real authority. There is no justification to demand these things from us at this point. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> So you are saying that talk of a diplomatic horizon will remain just that for as long as the international community does not treat the two sides equally?<P>

<b>Hamad:</b> We have long experience of a political process and things only got worse. The situation is this: if Hamas or any Palestinian faction accords recognition [to Israel], then where is the guarantee that anything will change for the Palestinian people? What happens after that? Settlement expansions, incursions, the building of the wall are all ongoing. So while the international community is strong in its support of Israel, no one is looking after the interests of the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> If people sat down and negotiated a final agreement first would that change the situation?<P>

<b>Hamad:</b> We are not against a political compromise. If they want to end the occupation then that is a good thing, indeed, we expect the international community to help us in this way. <P>

We are currently in a new situation. There is not now the program of Hamas or any one Palestinian faction, there is a unity agreement, so there is a real chance to change the political game.<P>

When we say we are ready to open a dialogue between the unity government and the western world, the language of boycott and sanctions just won't help. These sanctions have harmed the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories in all aspects of life. I hear new messages from European countries, encouraging dialogue with Hamas. This will help. It will build a bridge between the Palestinian people and the western world. <P>

But if the West only wants to use to the language of conditions, people will turn away. Some 90 percent of Palestinians support the unity government agreement. But ask them if they support the Quartet conditions. You will find maybe ten percent.- <i>Published 26/2/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
