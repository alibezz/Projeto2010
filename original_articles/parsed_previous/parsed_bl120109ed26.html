Some political situations escape the rigorous definitions of textbooks or grand diplomatic designs, and exist outside their boundaries. Hamas' rule in Gaza is a prime example of such a situation. It has many attributes of the state next door, like contiguous territory, single authority and military force, while not enjoying formal diplomatic recognition. Hamas effectively runs Gaza, without its green flag waving outside the United Nations headquarters in New York.
<p>
Thus, the world's first Palestinian state is being constructed in Gaza neither by a final-status deal with Israel nor by the Clinton parameters or the Bush roadmap, but rather by means of the guns and rockets of Hamas. It is simply there, ridiculing the endless efforts of leaders, diplomats and think-tankers to build a designer-made Palestinian state "living in peace and security" alongside Israel.
<p>
The current conflict in Gaza should be seen as Hamas' war of independence. At the time of writing, three-and-a-half years after Ariel Sharon's disengagement, Israel is deterred from reoccupying the Gaza Strip. True, Israel has been using considerable force against Hamas in Gaza, but stopped short of overthrowing its regime in order to replace it with a friendlier force like President Mahmoud Abbas' Palestinian Authority. And as expected, there are no volunteers to succeed Hamas in caring for the densely populated, poor and violent chunk of land on the eastern Mediterranean.
<p>
Moreover, UN Security Council Resolution 1860, which presented the international community's opinion of the crisis, does not challenge the political reality in Gaza beyond expressing hope for intra-Palestinian reconciliation. Hamas is not mentioned specifically, but neither is Abu Mazen, the PLO or the PA. In other words, the Security Council is standing on the sidelines of the Palestinian dispute, not showing preference for the eventual winner.
<p>
Hamas has also won implicit recognition of its military force. Resolution 1860 opposes further "illicit trafficking in arms" but says nothing about the existing stocks of Hamas and other militias and terrorist groups in Gaza like Islamic Jihad or the Durmush clan. There is no call for disarming them. This negligence undermines the Israeli demand for the demilitarization of a future Palestinian state.
<p>
In this light, Hamas's decision not to extend the six-month ceasefire but rather to challenge Israel to a duel appears more reasonable and less counterproductive than at first glance. Hamas is willing to pay with many casualties, both military and civilian, and with mass destruction in Gaza in return for being left alone to rule the territory under its terms. Hamas cannot "defeat" Israel, but if it survives the war it can present an alternative to the PA and the Oslo legacy. As time goes by, the world will get used to this de facto reality.
<p>
Israel says now that its goal is to overthrow Hamas "in the long run," through a combination of political and economic pressures. This is a euphemism for accepting an unpleasant reality. In fact, Israel is accepting--however grudgingly--the Hamas idea of long-term truce. Israel's key demand is to put the flow of arms into Gaza under check, thus preserving the balance of power. It appears that Israel and Hamas will eventually resume the armed ceasefire, with Israel maintaining economic control over Gaza.
<p>
Both sides have used the war to "change the rules of the game," Israel by bombing Gaza and invading it with ground forces, Hamas by targeting areas deep inside Israel that until now were beyond its range. This mutual show of force is meant to deter and delay the next round--at least until one side sees an opportunity to improve its relative situation.
<p>
From an Israeli perspective, a weakened Hamas is a lesser evil. Just like its Lebanese role model, Hizballah, it will have to keep the border calm and restrain smaller groups with less responsibility. It will also take care of all civilian affairs in Gaza. To a Likud government, its existence could also serve as a propaganda asset, showing to the world what Palestinian independence looks like: armed and Islamic.
<p>
To the Obama administration, the Gaza crisis gives both an opportunity and a challenge. The opportunity is to include Hamas in the political process. A stable ceasefire can serve as a basis for engaging Hamas and trying to lure it into accepting, even ambiguously, the international terms for recognition. If Israel is ready to live with Hamas, so can the United States.
<p>
The challenge will be to convince Israelis that Gaza will not repeat itself in the West Bank following an Israeli withdrawal. The rocket attacks on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, however mild in their damage, reminded Israelis of their vulnerability to hostile entities in their vicinity. Obama and his team will have to find a way to show Israelis that Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion Airport are not the next targets on the Hamas list.-<i> Published 12/1/2009 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
