<b>bitterlemons:</b> How important is the triangular relationship among the Palestinians, Israelis and Americans?
<p>
<b>Giacaman:</b> So far it has been an adversarial relationship, given the fact that Israel is occupying Palestinian territory and the almost total and blind American support for the Israeli position. In this sense, the US administration has never been an objective and fair intermediary between the two, quite the opposite.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> But is the US the only viable mediator?
<p>
<b>Giacaman:</b> So far, yes. That's why the initial position of the Obama administration gave Palestinians, and Arabs generally, some hope. However, it has become clear that there is either a lack of political will on the part of the administration or there are simply limitations on what an American administration can do, given the various forces that blindly support the position of any Israeli government, especially in the US Congress, which is dominated by the pro-Israel lobby.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> It is said that Israel is not a foreign policy issue in the US, but a domestic policy one. Is that a fair characterization? 
<p>
<b>Giacaman:</b> It is fair, but the reason is often not given. The reason is the power of the pro-Israel lobby, especially in Congress but also in the media and elsewhere. This is the main reason. It has nothing to do with any "strategic" relationship. In fact, the strategic angle is highly exaggerated in order to avoid the real reason for US support for Israel. I am not denying that there are common interests, but that is all. 
<p>
Let me give you an example. In all major Middle East wars in which the US was involved, the US had to fight without Israeli help. This includes the first Gulf war, where the US begged and bribed Israel not to respond to Iraqi rocket fire in order to avoid a linkage. Hence, at that time Israel was a strategic liability to the US. Now Israel is pushing the US to attack Iran. Israel needs US permission to do so itself, and if it did so it would be an incomplete job. In short, Israel has a strategic interest with its US relations, but not the other way around.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How would you characterize Palestinian-US relations? How effective are the Palestinians in similarly lobbying US decision-makers?
<p>
<b>Giacaman:</b> They are not. Palestinians and Arab governments have failed to establish any kind of influence inside the US. Palestinians have not paid this enough attention, but also the major interest of the US has to do with Arab countries and since Arab regimes prioritize self-preservation, other issues are less important. In fact, self-preservation, meaning the survival of the regime, in some countries depends on the good will of the US. Theoretically, Arab countries have the power to influence US policy, but since some are dependent on US protection for regime survival there are limits to what they can or will do. That is the problem of authoritarian Arab regimes.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> If these are the relations among the three parties, can there be much hope for a peace process mediated by the US unless something changes? 
<p>
<b>Giacaman:</b> The Palestinian Authority still has some hope that new initiatives may be proposed, even if that hope is fading. The PA does have one strength though, which is its weakness. Since Israel, the US, European and Arab countries have an interest in the continued existence of the PA, it could threaten to "commit suicide". This might happen anyway if there is no political progress, since there will be a gradual dismantlement of the PA. 
<p>
This is the only thing that might impel serious movement, because Israel is not interested in re-occupying the West Bank and administering the population there directly again. It wants a proxy administration to deal with the population and ensure its own security. It should be obvious that this cannot work without a credible political process leading to a Palestinian state.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you have any hope that the Obama administration, which started with so much vigor, will come up with something new?
<p>
<b>Giacaman:</b> All indications are that the American position is weak. The Obama administration does not have the sufficient political muscle to bring pressure to bear on the present Israeli government, due largely to domestic constraints. 
<p>
There are reports that the US is working on a new initiative for which details are sketchy. But it is suggested that one Palestinian request will be accommodated, which is that negotiations won't start from zero but will have their point of reference in previous negotiations and in various UN Security Council resolutions. If this turns out to be acceptable to both sides we might see new negotiations, especially if there is a deadline as to when talks should finish.- <i>Published 21/12/2009 &copy; bitterlemons.org</I>
