When Pope Benedict XVI stood atop Mount Nebo in Jordan, looking across the Dead Sea to Israel and affirming the umbilical link between the Church and the Jewish people, a circle was closed. In a speech steeped in theology and history, the Pope referred to the fact that this was the place from which, according to biblical tradition, Moses had seen the Promised Land that he was not to enter. Possibly he might have also contemplated how much water had flowed down the Jordan River since one of his predecessors, Pius X, met Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, in 1904.
<p>
At that meeting, two millennia of theological tensions between the Church and the Jews made a dialogue virtually impossible. Herzl dwelt on the plight of Jews in Europe and sought the Holy See's support for their pursuit of refuge in Palestine. The pope explained, in polite but firm language, that as long as the Jews rejected Jesus as the Messiah the Church was unable to support their return to their ancestral land. On the other hand, the Pontiff suggested, were the Jews ready to embrace Christ, there were plenty of churches and monasteries in the Holy Land that would gladly welcome them and support their return to Palestine.
<p>
Today's approach of the Catholic Church to the Jews has indeed undergone a fundamental transformation, as evidenced in the Second Vatican Council and the Papal encyclical "Nostra Aetate". No longer are the Jews declared collectively responsible for the crucifixion; the Church now recognizes that the original covenant between God and the people of Israel was not annulled by the message of Christ. Most profoundly and symbolically, this was epitomized in Pope John Paul's magnanimous decision, during his visit in 2000, to deposit a missive in the cracks of the Wailing Wall in which he asked the Jewish people's forgiveness for the pain and suffering inflicted upon it by the Church over many generations. The Vatican's recognition of the State of Israel is obviously another visible and potent sign of this change of heart.
<p>
It is indeed an ambiguous history, and not all Christians and Jews are aware of its complexities. Modern European anti-Semitism emerged as a political, secular and mainly racist ideology, evidently in contradiction to the Church's doctrine. Yet the embrace of racist anti-Semitism by so many in the twentieth century, especially in Nazi Germany, cannot be totally divorced from the Church's hostility to the Jews. While racist anti-Semitism is intellectually quite different from Christian theological anti-Judaism, in many peoples' minds the two may not be that separate, and the road from the one to the other can be easily traversed.
<p>
It is tragic that it was only the enormity of the Holocaust that made the Church aware of its need to re-think its attitude to the Jewish people. As Israel's Chief Rabbi Jonah Metzger said during his meeting with Pope Benedict XVI, had such a meeting taken place in the 1930s the Holocaust might not have happened and six million Jews would not have been murdered.
<p>
While conciliation between the Church and Judaism has taken place and is now a major fact on the international scene--despite obvious discordant voices, some of which were evident during Benedict's visit--the deep chasm between Christianity and Islam is still there, and may not be easily overcome. This came into the open in the response to the pope's Regensburg speech in which he cited the vicious attacks of a Byzantine Emperor on Islam. The pope did retract his words, but the issue will not go away: both Christianity and Islam are universal religions, with a deep commitment to spreading their faith across the world. For this reason reconciliation with Judaism, which is a national religion and has no universal aspirations, is--paradoxically--easier. Unlike both Christianity and Islam, Judaism never aspired to world dominion. The historic conquests of Islam, as well as the Crusades, figure prominently in the memory of both world religions not only of themselves--but also of the "other".
<p>
For this reason, it is doubtful whether the Church can be helpful in solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Soothing words to both sides may not suffice: the fact of the matter is that both Christianity and Islam continue to view each other with deep suspicion. This can be seen by the fears of many Europeans regarding the growth of Muslim communities in Europe, as well as the reluctance to see Turkey become a member of the European Union. On the other hand, there is the trepidation with which Christians in Arab countries view the emergence of Islamist movements. These obviously tend to undermine both the feeling of personal security as well as of collective belonging of Christian communities, from the Copts in Egypt to the Assyrians and Chaldeans in Iraq.
<p>
The pope's visit to the Holy Land was a powerful symbol of the drive for historic reconciliation. But the road ahead is not easy and may still be rocky.- <i>Published 18/5/2009 &copy; bitterlemons.org</I>
