<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why hold a summit of opposition parties at the same time as the Annapolis meeting? Is this not merely a public relations stunt?<P>

<b>Yusuf:</b> It is more effective to send a message at the same time as Annapolis. Most of the Palestinian people and institutions are opposed to the Annapolis meeting because we believe it is simply designed to put pressure on President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) to make more concessions. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What message do you hope this opposition summit will send?<P>

<b>Yusuf:</b> The message we hope to send is that Palestinians are not only represented by Ramallah. Half of all Palestinians live abroad and they reject the Annapolis meeting, because they want Abu Mazen to stop making concessions, especially on the right of return. This is in addition to the many Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza that also reject the Annapolis meeting. <P>

We hope to drive home the message that the Palestinian people refuse to normalize with the Israeli occupation. The opposition conference is there to focus international opinion on the rights that are being denied us daily by the Israeli occupation and to underline that no one has the legitimacy to sign away any of these rights.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Who is the summit directed at? The Palestinian people, the presidency or the international community?<P>

<b>Yusuf:</b> The opposition summit addresses the international community as well as the Palestinian negotiating delegation. We hope to show the international community that this delegation does not negotiate in the name of the Palestinian people and that Abu Mazen does not represent every Palestinian. <P>

We are also addressing the American administration. Enough conferences and enough false promises. We have heard the lie that the US is committed to establishing an independent Palestinian state since Oslo. We heard it at Taba and at Sharm al-Sheikh. We've seen it in the roadmap and we hear it now. Palestinians do not trust Washington any longer, because we believe the US is biased and blindly supports Israel. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What does Hamas itself hope to achieve at such a summit?<P>

<b>Yusuf:</b> Hamas wants an end to the occupation and a strict time limit for when this will happen. Also, we want to show that Hamas is a key player in the region and that the movement represents a significant proportion of Palestinians. Nothing can be achieved without the approval of Hamas.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Would it not be more productive for opposition parties to come out with  a joint statement before the Annapolis meeting outlining exactly what they expect from Abbas and any negotiations with Israel in order to set down a clear target to which any negotiations can be compared?<P>

<b>Yusuf:</b> Any such statement will not have much of an impact. We want to show that there is real political weight behind us and that we represent the biggest proportion of the Palestinian people. We also hope to gain Arab support for this conference. A simple statement will not achieve any of this.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you expect anything positive to come out of either Annapolis or the opposition summit?<P>

<b>Yusuf:</b> We want only to record a very clear position: Abu Mazen is not the Palestinian people and he is not the only one who can deal with the supreme national issues. He is only one of the addresses and there are others that the international community must deal with.- <i>Published 5/11/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
