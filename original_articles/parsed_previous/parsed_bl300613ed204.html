<b>bitterlemons:</b> The most recent development in Jerusalem is the planned demolitions of houses in Silwan. What is happening there?<P>

<b>Hammouri:</b> This will affect roughly 1,000 people. The Israeli municipality is talking about some 90 houses and all the houses are crowded with more than seven people per dwelling.<P>

Of course, this is a political issue and has nothing to do with the lack or otherwise of building permits. The Israeli authorities want to get rid of the Palestinian population from Jerusalem. They have declared that they want to reduce the Palestinian population of East Jerusalem to 40-50,000. At the moment, Palestinians with blue Jerusalem ID cards number more than 240,000 people. So they want to evacuate more than 200,000 people. <P>

They are using several elements to this end, including house demolitions, land confiscations and the building of the wall, which in itself will affect roughly 100-120,000 people.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How exactly will the wall do that?<P>

<b>Hammouri:</b> The people that will be left outside the wall will be considered as outside the borders of the municipality and then outside the borders of Israel. Thus they will lose any benefits like national insurance, and their information will be transferred to the Israeli interior ministry, which, in turn, will confiscate their IDs. That will leave them as absentees, and, as absentees, any property they may have in Jerusalem will eventually be confiscated. It is a program that works in stages.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What about the settlement ring around Jerusalem?<P>

<b>Hammouri:</b> The aim of all these plans, including the settlements, is to evacuate Palestinians from Jerusalem and assert complete Israeli control over the city as a Jewish city. Israel has been trying to do this in different ways since 1967. Until today it has not succeeded. On the contrary, the Palestinian population in Jerusalem has been increasing. But with this new plan, I think they might succeed.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How does that affect the possibilities for a political solution?<P>

<b>Hammouri:</b> In the last week, there was a declaration from [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon that Israel will never divide Jerusalem and it will always be the capital of Israel. Peres, in a similar way, said it was impossible to have such a city with so many Palestinians, indirectly suggesting evacuating the population as a result. The Israelis are trying to create new facts on the ground before any final agreement to preempt the issue in negotiations.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> But it takes two parties to make an agreement. Will the Palestinians ever agree to a solution without Jerusalem?<P>

<b>Hammouri:</b> Of course not. But it seems the Israeli authorities are not interested in a solution. Israel wants to leave Gaza--they have wanted to do this for a while--it is costly for them. But in the West Bank, Israel wants the land without the people.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> But in the long term doesn't this simply prolong the conflict?<P>

<b>Hammouri:</b> Yes. And this is what [former Israeli Chief of Staff Moshe] Yaalon said just a week ago. He said he will not see a peaceful settlement in the near future or in his lifetime. It seems there is, among the senior level of the Israeli leadership, a clear decision not to try to reach a solution in the near future.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> In this case, what ought a Palestinian strategy be?<P>

<b>Hammouri:</b> The Palestinian side is trying to implement everything they are asked by the international community in the hope that the international community, including the US, might exert pressure on Israel. But, you feel from Palestinian statements, that they too see no solution in the near future. Some two months ago, [Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud] Abbas said he hoped the withdrawal from Gaza would not be the end of the story, and it seems there is doubt whether or not that indeed will be the case.- <i>Published 13/6/2005 (c) bitterlemons.org<P>
