an interview with Ayman Taher

</table><p>


<b>bitterlemons:</b> Hamas has now taken full control in Gaza. Aides to President Mahmoud Abbas have called the events in Gaza the actions of "murderers". Is there any possibility of reconciliation with Fateh?<P>

<b>Taher:</b> We don't have any problem with Fateh. We are together in a struggle for liberation and we are together in the political process. The problem, from the beginning, was and still is with the group inside Fateh that was planning to undermine Hamas' election victory and is following its own agenda. This group is headed by Mohammad Dahlan and his men.<P> 

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What is the future of the Palestinian Authority now that Abbas has fired the government? <P>

<b>Taher:</b> Hamas is committed to Palestinian unity and the unity government. This government was welcomed by all Palestinian factions, all Arab countries and some countries outside the region. We still believe it is the only choice for Palestinians. The emergency government that has been established by President Abbas is not acceptable and has no future. <P>

It seems, however, that Abbas from the beginning has been working on destroying the Palestinian cause and separating the two sides of Palestine. He was, after all, the designer of the conspiracy called Oslo. <P>

Nevertheless, I can affirm that the only future is with the unity government and we are still committed to it. The PA exists and Hamas will protect it and we will not allow any project that separates Gaza and the West Bank, neither geographically nor politically.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Are there not, in effect, two Palestinian Authorities now, one in the West Bank and one in Gaza?<P>

<b>Taher:</b> No. Palestine is one unity. The PA is still one authority and all the conspiracies that are being made and designed against it will collapse. The PA is the legitimate choice of the Palestinians. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Does Hamas intend to respect the Basic Law, and, in terms of establishing law and order, will Hamas support an independent judiciary in Gaza based on that Basic Law?<P>

<b>Taher:</b> Hamas has always faced a problem with Fateh, or at least the above group in Fateh, not respecting the Basic Law. From the beginning Hamas has called for respect for the law and respect for the independence of the judiciary through transparency and appointments based on merit and qualification. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Hamas ran for and won democratic elections. Now it has also used force to impose its will. Is Hamas still committed to the democratic process? <P>

<b>Taher:</b> We did not use force to impose our will. We used force only when necessary to protect ourselves from this group in Fateh that was planning a coup against the legitimately elected government. Hamas is the democratic choice and built the government by democratic choice. We used force to protect democracy. <P>

This group in Fateh was threatening and killing Hamas members. We were targeted even in the mosque. We used force to defend ourselves. The coup group has now moved to the West Bank and everyone can see what they are doing there.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> With Hamas in control of Gaza, but Israel in control of borders, there would seem to have to be some contact between Hamas and Israel at least for practical purposes. How will Hamas deal with this issue?<P>

<b>Taher:</b> There is a government here and this government will deal with this subject. From the beginning Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh gave instructions to the relevant ministries and officials to deal with their Israeli counterparts on all issues related to practical affairs. We have no problem with this issue. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> The Arab League and the Quartet have condemned the Gaza take-over. There is a possibility that Gaza will now be even more isolated. What plans does Hamas have to overcome this problem?<P>

<b>Taher:</b> We are not trying to impose our control on Gaza. We came to power through elections. The international community imposed a siege on the will of the Palestinian people and tried to undermine its democratic choice. The international position is against democracy. Hamas is protecting the democratic choice of Palestinians. The siege has been imposed for about a year and a half and we have done our best to punch holes in the walls of this siege. We have managed. We are continuing serious contacts with Arab and European countries in order to lift the siege imposed on the Palestinians.- <i>Published 18/6/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
