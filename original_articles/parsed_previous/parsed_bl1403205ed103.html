<b>bitterlemons:</b> How important is the prisoner release issue?<P>

<b>Jarrar:</b> The release of prisoners is one of the most important issues for Palestinians. We are talking about 8,000 prisoners and it's an issue for the nation. Everyone has been looking to the ceasefire, but it will mean nothing if there is no real release of Palestinian political prisoners, especially the 270 who have been in jail since before Oslo. <P>

Palestinians are looking for a real release, a release without any of the usual Israeli conditions and which should include those from Jerusalem, from the 1948 areas and from the Golan Heights.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> You said there were 8,000 prisoners. How many does this really affect?<P>

<b>Jarrar:</b> It affects more than 60,000 people. You are talking about immediate families and other relatives, and this is of course only with regard to those currently in prison. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What kind of rights do relatives have? When we say it affects them, apart from the absence of the person, what are we talking about?<P>

<b>Jarrar:</b> When we talk about 900 political prisoners in administrative detention, for example, about 20 of those for over two years, these people have jobs, some are academics, some are students and they have families. These people are under arbitrary arrest. They have been taken out of their work and society, yet they have no idea of when they will be released.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> This is administrative detention where the prisoners have not been brought to trial.<P>

<b>Jarrar:</b> Yes. Administrative detention should be stopped completely; it is simply arbitrary. <P>

In other cases, besides the economic aspect--most prisoners are the main source of income for their families--there are the social and psychological effects of being isolated from their homes and loved ones. There are about 128 female prisoners, 20 of them mothers. The psychological aspect affects the whole family, from elderly parents to children.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> What are the numbers of underage prisoners?<P>

<b>Jarrar:</b> There are around 20 prisoners under 18. Most of them are not in a special prison, as they should be according to international law and separated from the adults. Instead they are in detention centers like Ofer and Megiddo. The conditions of these minors, of both sexes, are very problematic.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> In general, what are the conditions like for prisoners?<p>

<b>Jarrar:</b> The biggest problem for prisoners is family visits. Only first degree relatives can apply for a permit to visit, and then only if they are either under 15 or over 45. It takes months to receive a permit and still most end up being rejected for "security reasons". <P>

Then there is the condition of the visit itself. People travel long distances, leaving their villages or cities at four in the morning not to return until 10 at night, with all the checkpoints in between. Then they end up in a room with two walls, one glass and one metal, with holes, separating them from their relative. It's very difficult to hear and it's very difficult to see. After five minutes of concentrating you go crazy.<P>

There are no facilities for the family, no suitable bathrooms or waiting facilities, the visit itself is a form of suffering, if it happens. Some 2,000 prisoners are not allowed any visits at all, because of the many conditions.<P>

The second issue is that of prisoners held in isolation. Some 100 prisoners are isolated from other prisoners within the prisons. There is the issue of medical care. In emergencies people receive treatment immediately, but in other cases there are long delays, and sometimes people wait years for surgery.<P>

They transfer prisoners from prison to prison without notifying anyone. In addition to the lack of stability that entails, the transfer is atrocious. People are stripped naked, they are beaten and transferred in the most humiliating way. In addition, families then need to reapply for permits to the new prison.<P>

Then, of course, there is administrative detention. Holding these hundreds of people with no rights of visit and no court trial and no idea of when they will be released is very hard on the prisoners.<P>

There are hundreds of conditions we can talk about. A special Israeli committee went to the prisons and found that the conditions are not satisfactory. This is not to mention the interrogation centers and the conditions there, with one-by-one meter cells painted in black and with no windows. Lawyers have no access and prisoners can spend days in such cells.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> In your opinion what would constitute a serious release, and what effect would it have?<P>

<b>Jarrar:</b> It's a very important issue and it should be a real release, and this consists of a release with no conditions. They should start with the 270 oldest prisoners that have been in prison since before Oslo, whether they have killed or wounded Israelis or are from Jerusalem or whatever. In addition they should also release those in administrative detention. After that, they need to set a schedule for releasing the rest.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Will this bolster the ceasefire?<P>

<b>Jarrar:</b> There are many important issues for the ceasefire, but prisoner release is certainly one of them. Prisoners themselves have come out in support of the ceasefire, but that will not last if there is no release. Then prisoners will come to the conclusion that Israel is really only acting in its own interest. - <i>Published 14/3/2005 (c) bitterlemons-international.org<P>
