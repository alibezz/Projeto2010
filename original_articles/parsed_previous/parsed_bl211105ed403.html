<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is Amir Peretz's election as Israeli Labor party leader a cause for optimism for Palestinians?
<p>
<b>Saed: </b>I believe Amir Peretz will work hard for the peace process. I've known Amir for many years, and in all our discussions he always voiced his belief in a two-state solution. Every time we discussed the Palestinian issue, he showed good understanding of the Palestinian situation and the needs of Palestinian workers.
<p>
The last time we met was in Brussels at the International Conference for International Trade Unions, and he told me how important Palestinian labor was for Israel. He understands our situation and he understands and supports people-to-people work to resolve Palestinian-Israeli problems. I believe he will open contacts with the PA and will work hard to make progress on the peace process.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Will Peretz's background as a union leader bring a new approach to the conflict?
<p>
<b>Saed: </b>I think he understands the labor issue very well and he understands that when we have agreements between Israelis and Palestinians they benefit workers in both places. Unlike former Israeli leaders, he understands the importance of people-to-people contacts and how such contacts are enhanced through labor. 
<p>
Some people are fearful that Peretz will change if he becomes prime minister, but my reading of him is that he will work very hard for peace.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why are you so optimistic?
<p>
<b>Saed: </b>Peretz used to be mayor of Sderot, near the border with Gaza. He had good relations with many people in Gaza, and he visited there many times. He understands the Palestinian people and has told me several times of his desire to put an end to the conflict, by giving Palestinians their rights in a state alongside Israel.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What makes him different from other Labor party leaders?
<p>
<b>Saed: </b>This is the first time the Labor party elects a leader with a civilian background, who has worked closely with the people and the workers. The ex-leaders of the Labor party come either from the army or have a significant security background. I think Peretz is more open to a civilian approach to the conflict rather than a security approach.
<p>
He understands, for example, that among the workers of the world, the Palestinian workers suffer from one of the highest levels of poverty, and he understands that this is an issue that must be addressed.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you think Peretz's Moroccan roots will be a significant factor?
<p>
<b>Saed: </b>No. This is sometimes mentioned, but this is an Israeli issue. For Palestinians, we don't see this as an east-west issue. Palestinians are looking for an Israeli leader who will seriously pursue the peace process.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What chance does Peretz have of becoming prime minister?
<p>
<b>Saed: </b>I think because he has worked so hard as head of Histadrut for the rights of Israeli workers, on issues such as minimum wage and social security, he could stand a good chance of winning an election. I believe his argument with Benyamin Netanyahu over the labor issue will stand him in good stead. 
<p>
I also hope he will become prime minister, because I think he will look for a solution to the Palestinian issue, and continue what Rabin began. More than any other Israeli leader, he will seriously pursue the peace process.- <i>Published 21/11/2005 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
