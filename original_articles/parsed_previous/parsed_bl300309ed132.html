an interview with Mkhaimar Abusada

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you think a Netanyahu-led government will be bad news for Palestinians?
<p>
<b>Abusada:</b> I'm not sure that a Netanyahu-led government will be much worse than the previous government. If you look at the Palestinian-Israeli conflict over the past 60 years, it has been going from bad to worse.
<p>
Yes, it will be worse, but that doesn't mean the previous government was good. The Olmert government talked about peace on the one hand, and on the other expanded settlements, built the wall, encircled East Jerusalem and in the process marginalized President Mahmoud Abbas. 
<p>
Maybe the next Israeli government will expose itself to the Palestinians, the Arabs and the international community as a much more aggressive government.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> If this happens could that be a positive thing, in a roundabout way?
<p>
<b>Abusada:</b> Yes, in the way it was positive with the Shamir government in the past or even the former Netanyahu government. Then, US relations with Israel deteriorated because these rightwing governments did not want to abide by the peace process. So, by showing Israel's real face--look at Avigdor Lieberman as foreign minister, a man who has talked about destroying the Aswan Dam, expelling Palestinians, etc.--this may raise an alarm among international actors. 
<p>
We have already seen certain signals from the international community. A few days ago, the European Union said that if the Netanyahu government did not accept the two-state solution, it would damage European-Israeli relations.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What about Gaza? What chance now for a ceasefire agreement or a prisoner exchange deal?
<p>
<b>Abusada:</b> If there will not be a prisoner exchange deal in the next few days, I don't see much chance under Netanyahu. Netanyahu does not have the same moral obligation as the Olmert government to secure the release of Gilad Shalit. Also, I don't think the Netanyahu government, based on the rhetoric of his party and coalition partners, would go ahead with a prisoner exchange deal that sees certain Hamas members freed. So I don't see any possibility of a prisoner exchange deal between Hamas and a Netanyahu government.
<p>
As for a ceasefire, as I understand it according to the coalition agreement between Netamyahu and Lieberman, the next Israeli government wants to put an end to Hamas rule in Gaza. I'm not sure whether or not Netanyahu can do this, but I don't think Netanyahu will tolerate any rockets from Gaza. I think the relationship between Gaza and Israel under the new government will be a very aggressive one.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How important is Palestinian reconciliation?
<p>
<b>Abusada:</b> Palestinian reconciliation should be a top priority for Palestinians. The rhetoric coming from Netanyahu and his coalition should be noted by Palestinian leaders and spur them to put aside their differences. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to me that Palestinian leaders acknowledge the nature of these threats. Palestinian factions, both Hamas and Fateh, are looking out for their own narrow interests rather than the national interest. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is it your feeling that Netanyahu will commit to a two-state solution and if he doesn't, what of the international community?
<p>
<b>Abusada:</b> I think Netanyahu will only commit to a two-state solution in the mold of Ariel Sharon, i.e., a state on maximum 50 percent of the West Bank, something Palestinians would never accept. But I don't think the international community is in a position to put too much pressure on Israel in this case.
<p>
The EU, for instance, still labors under its historic guilt and so will not pressure Israel too much. Every time Europe tries to put Israel under pressure, it is accused of being anti-Semitic. Maybe relations will worsen, but not to the point of an economic boycott or any meaningful pressure.- <i>Published 30/03/2009 &copy; bitterlemons.org</I>
