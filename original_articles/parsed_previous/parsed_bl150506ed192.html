In its early days of conception, the Palestinian Authority was perceived by Palestinians and most members of the international community as the initial stage of a nascent Palestinian state. It was the byproduct of a peace process resulting in bilateral negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis and based on the principle of "land for peace" and the two-state solution. The Palestinian Authority was comprised of the nucleus of a central government and budding state institutions, including some services that the Palestinian people were deprived of under direct Israeli administration. 
<P>
Over the last ten years, the Palestinian Authority largely succeeded in completing this mission, and the Palestinian people began to run most of their affairs by themselves--that is, until the peace process was interrupted by Israeli withdrawal from negotiations under Prime Minister Ehud Barak. It appears that Barak saw the 2000 Camp David summit as a chance to tell Palestinians to "take it or leave it," thus shoring up his domestic support. But Barak entered the summit having already lost power to a right-wing Knesset that did not share in the prevalent assumptions of the peace process. That period marked the beginning of Israel's efforts to weaken the Palestinian Authority, most easily witnessed in the aerial bombing of its institutions, withholding of its tax revenues, and restrictions on its officials.
<P>
The collapse of the Palestinian Authority, a plausible outcome of the current Israeli and international embargo of aid, is a byproduct of the stated Israeli strategy of ignoring the Palestinian side. This unilateral approach mostly reflects a right-wing Israeli political and ideological background that is antithetical to a peace process based in international legality. Rather than pursue negotiations within the context of the peace process, the Israelis have chosen a unilateral approach based on the balance of power and Israeli interests alone.
<P>
This unilateralism and other Israeli practices that the international community has largely turned a blind eye to have been at least in part responsible for another outcome in Israel's favor: the success of Hamas in the recent elections. Having Hamas in charge of the Palestinian government has deflected attention from Israel's failure to comply with international laws and norms, which are Palestinians' only redress as the weaker party in negotiations.
<P>
It is ironic that neither Israel nor Hamas is enthusiastic about the two-state solution or sees significance in the 1967 borders. Both disregard international legality, as far as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is concerned. It is also ironic that both are more comfortable with unilateralism. Hamas is thus able to avoid the embarrassment of negotiating with a party it does not recognize, and Israel has no political resistance from the Palestinians--and consequently, from abroad--in proceeding with its plans. As long as Israel is providing Hamas with enough room to manage internal affairs, Hamas seems willing and able to provide Israel with the necessary security. 
<P>
In other words, we are currently entering a situation where the Palestinian Authority is either physically collapsing or becoming an apparatus "smaller" than the original vision within the context of the peace process and a state within the 1967 borders. This collapse or transformation may not take place suddenly, but rather have gradual manifestations. One of these is the gradual separation of Gaza, not only from Israel, but also from the West Bank. The second manifestation is what we are currently witnessing--a gradual reduction in the function and importance of the Palestinian Authority, which is receding in the face of a growing Israeli security role and international humanitarian intervention. This may even become an undeclared trusteeship in the Palestinian territories. 
<P>
To diminish the Palestinian Authority as a viable stepping stone in the creation of an independent Palestinian state is Israel's plan. This strategy has been facilitated by Hamas' rise to power through the short-sighted strategy of a short-sighted Israeli leadership--which unfortunately has not been stymied by a responsible international community. It is a strategy that can only lead to deepening mutual hatred and hostility, a prolongation of the conflict, and its transference to future generations. 
<P>
We had a brief opportunity to establish a Palestinian state alongside the state of Israel and thereby to end this conflict once and for all. But this gust of hope appears to have passed us by, and with it not only an end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict but the chance for normalization of Israeli relations with the Arab world, embodied in the nearly-forgotten Arab initiative for peace. - <i>Published 15/5/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
