<b>bitterlemons:</b> Let’s begin by clarifying the difference between an armistice line and an international border.
<p> 
<b>Lapidoth:</b> There is a huge difference. An armistice line by definition is only a military line and is supposed to be provisional. The 1949 armistice agreements insist they do not create a political border but a military line that the armed forces should not cross. Our armistice lines are more stable than usual because they were instituted in pursuance of Security Council resolutions of November 4 and 16, 1948.
<p> 
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Which has more validity at the negotiating table, an international border or an armistice line?
<p> 
<b>Lapidoth:</b> An international border--but only a valid one. The problem with Israel is we have a valid international border with Jordan and Egypt, whereas with Syria and Lebanon only an armistice line was agreed. With Lebanon the two coincide--international border and armistice line. With Syria they do not coincide. With Palestine there has never been an international border but only armistice lines agreed by Israel and Jordan and Egypt.
<p> 
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Now to the differences between the 1949 and 1967 lines. What is a no-man’s land? And how valid is the cancellation of no-man’s lands by Israel, Jordan and Egypt many years ago?
<p> 
<b>Lapidoth:</b> No-man’s land means an area without a sovereign, or, in our context, the area between the lines of the two armies. All the armistice agreements with our neighbors state that no civilian may cross the area between the lines. When states move from a ceasefire to an armistice they try to divide among themselves the no-mans land. 
<p> 
The second term we have to deal with is demilitarized zone, where the two parties have agreed to limit or completely prohibit the positioning of armed forces and fortifications. 
We had demilitarized zones, for example, in the north with Syria, and in the south with Egypt at Uja al-Hafir. All four armistice agreements [with Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon] also established limitation of forces zones or defensive areas.
<p> 
<b>bitterlemons:</b> And with the Palestinian territories? 
<p> 
<b>Lapidoth:</b> The armistice agreement with Egypt stated that in the north of the Gaza Strip Israeli forces had to withdraw, but Egyptian forces could not advance, though this was not called a demilitarized zone. 
<p> 
In the West Bank, between the ceasefire lines of 1948 and the armistice lines of 1949 all the no-man’s land was divided, except at Latroun and Jerusalem. Jordanian and Iraqi forces withdrew from the Little Triangle and Wadi Ara. There may have been something additional that I don’t know of because according to the agreement the parties could change the lines by common consent. In 1951, for example, the parties divided the demilitarized zone near government house in Jerusalem; the new line separating Jordanians and Israelis was called the civilian line. It was created in the mixed-armistice commission and accepted by both parties.
 <p> 
As far as I know there is no other difference between the lines of 1949 and June 4, 1967.
<p> 
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Can you speculate why President Bush mentioned the 1949 lines? 
<p> 
<b>Lapidoth:</b> In the areas of Gaza and the West Bank I don’t see any reason.  In the case of Syria it gives us an advantage, since we claim the 1949 lines and they claim 1967. Bush may have mentioned 1949 due to the influence of the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice [which uses the 1949 line as a point of reference]. 
<p> 
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Some Palestinians have expressed a preference for the 1949 lines as a basis for negotiation.
<p> 
<b>Lapidoth:</b> I really don’t know why. The 1949 line doesn’t give them an advantage in negotiations. The Palestinians were not a party to the armistice agreements, so this weakens their position. Don’t forget that with regard to 1949 all four agreements state clearly these are only military lines and they have no political validity whatsoever. 
<p> 
So this is not particularly significant and not helpful to either side. The green line has survival power for a military line because there is nothing else and never was between Israel and Palestine. But all four armistice lines are “without prejudice to claims and rights of the parties”. They are only military lines that prevent the passage of armed forces.-<i> Published 6/6/2005 © bitterlemons.org </i>
