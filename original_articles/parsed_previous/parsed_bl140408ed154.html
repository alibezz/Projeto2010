<b>bitterlemons:</b> Damascus came out in the last couple of weeks saying that recent Israeli military exercises were targeted at Syria. Is there a serious chance of conflagration between Syria and Israel at the moment?
<P>
<b>Abu Zayyad:</b> I think both sides understand the serious consequences of confrontation, one of which is that other parties will be involved. I exclude a bilateral confrontation between Israel and Syria unless it starts somewhere else, like Lebanon or even Iran. 
<P>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> But if both sides are aware of the consequences, why the ratcheting up of the rhetoric?
<P>
<b>Abu Zayyad:</b> We should not forget that at the same time as this military exercise in Israel there was a kind of exchange of statements from both sides on the necessity of solving the mutual problem and being involved in a political settlement to the conflict.
<P>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> If the focus is on the Syrian-Israeli front, is the Palestinian track then shunted aside?
<P>
<b>Abu Zayyad:</b> There was a traditional argument that if Israel focuses on the Syrian track it will be at the cost of the Palestinian-Israeli process. I don't buy this argument. I think that at the end of the day what the region needs is a comprehensive settlement with all the parties involved, specifically Lebanon, Syria, the Palestinians and Israel. So I am not afraid of any direct political negotiations between Israel and the Syrians, because in the end I think it will help the Palestinian problem. I don't think the Syrians will accept to have on record that they made peace with Israel and neglected the Palestinian cause.
<P>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What about the other way around? Would Syria prevent the Palestinian-Israeli track from going too far if it is left behind?
<P>
<b>Abu Zayyad:</b> There was an impression that the Syrians at some stage wanted the Palestinians to be one of the cards they could play at the table. I don't know to what extent this is true, but I do know that the Syrians will not sell out the Palestinian cause.
<P>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> If there is a conflagration, whether just between Syria and Israel or also involving other players like Lebanon and Iran, will that end the Palestinian-Israeli peace process?
<P>
<b>Abu Zayyad:</b> If there is total conflict in the region new realities will spring up and a new map will be drawn. If you think about such a scenario, a total war between Israel, Syria, Iran, Lebanon and even some Palestinian groups, I fear it will be a disaster for everyone. I'm afraid it will not be limited to conventional weapons or be under the control of wise and intelligent leaders. Such a confrontation could be in the hands of fanatics and adventurers. It's a scenario I don't like to think about.
<P>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is there a sense that the current process, if not proceeding well, might strengthen the kind of extremist thinking you fear?
<P>
<b>Abu Zayyad:</b> I actually don't think there is a peace process. A process means something is going on. But I see no practical or substantial evidence of this. Since the Annapolis conference there have been meetings between Palestinians and Israelis but as far as I can see, nothing substantial has been achieved. So maybe it's an exaggeration to call it a peace process.
<P>
At the moment, we have an American administration that is approaching its last days in power. It seems to have no influence and is unable to force anyone to do anything. Perhaps the Republicans are in need of the Jewish vote and won't go far in pushing the parties. 
<P>
Everyone seems to want something to show their own publics, something to point to to say that they are doing something. There is a saying in Arabic, "al-haraka baraka", that the most important thing is just to keep moving even if you're not going anywhere.<i>- Published 14/4/2008 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
