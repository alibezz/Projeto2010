New-old winds are blowing in the Middle East. In early November a conference is supposed to take place under American auspices where an Israeli-Palestinian settlement will be discussed and, many hope, agreed. If indeed the conference produces such a breakthrough, those involved in advancing the Arab peace initiative see improved chances for realizing the regional vision it lays out in general terms.<P>

In anticipation of the conference and in an effort to prevent it becoming yet another symbol of prolonged political paralysis, the various involved parties are busy laying the groundwork for a businesslike exchange of views. Naturally most of the activity is at the Israeli-Palestinian level, with renewed contacts focusing on ways in which Israel can strengthen the Palestinian Authority and joint thinking about the principles of an agreed settlement. <P>

Conference preparations dovetail with the developments that have taken place in the Israeli-Palestinian arena since the schism between the two leading Palestinian movements, Fateh and Hamas, which was generated by Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip. The rift, with its geographic imprint, is seen by many as rendering Israeli-Palestinian dialogue over an agreement that much easier. The guidelines of the government formed in Ramallah after the coup in Gaza include an undertaking to end the conflict and omit any commitment to "resistance". Hence they ostensibly constitute a promising platform for pragmatic dialogue.<P>

Yet, when Israel discusses with the PA security coordination, concessions on movement of the civilian population, release of prisoners or transfer of tax funds--with whom is it talking? These contacts take place between Israel and one Palestinian government, alongside which there functions a second, boycotted government. The legal significance of this complex political situation can be bypassed since in any case PA President Mahmoud Abbas holds the mandate for peace negotiations. But the complexity is not merely legal; it also reflects an ideological and institutional split that has emerged as--over the past seven years of confrontation with Israel and particularly the direct Palestinian-to-Palestinian confrontation--central rule in the territories has collapsed. One expression of this collapse is the PA's inability to make long-term decisions, not to mention implementation of policies for improving security that might deny Israel any excuse for continuing to suspend the peace process.<P>

Despite the massive international backing it enjoys, the Fateh government does not have sufficient local legitimization to commit to a settlement based on the principle of two states for two peoples; it certainly can't guarantee implementation of such an agreement. In contrast, Hamas has a proven capacity to drag Israel into responding militarily to its terrorist attacks, thereby thwarting any attempt to advance toward security and implementation of agreements. Hamas will undoubtedly take this route if it is left out of the peace process that is currently taking shape. This will happen because Hamas continues to reject the demands made by Israel and the Quartet as conditions for dialogue. <P>

Further, Hamas' takeover of the Gaza Strip and the failed attempt to maintain a Palestinian unity government brought the rivalry between Hamas and Fateh to new levels that defy resolution. Progress toward peace will only escalate the struggle, while failure of the planned process will further weaken the camp led by Fateh and further empower Hamas: the law of connected vessels works in the Palestinian arena like anywhere else.<P>

From Israel's standpoint, the Fateh-Hamas rivalry complicates the already complex challenge of dealing with final status issues. Evidently, Hamas cannot be changed; its ideological platform is inflexible. Its popular support, which does not exceed that of Fateh, nevertheless enables it to challenge the traditional national leadership. Thus if this Israeli government really seeks a viable final status agreement it must alter the political-territorial arena in which the conflict takes place. This it can do by displaying a willingness to negotiate borders, refugees and Jerusalem on the basis of the Arab peace initiative. <P>

In other words, Israel has to make the Palestinian public an offer it can't refuse in order to bypass Hamas on the road to making and implementing a deal. The thaw in Israel's relations with the Arab states as a consequence of such a deal will help reduce both the security risks it takes upon itself and the price it pays in terms of concessions without which a deal is impossible.<P>

Is the government of Israel ready to follow this path? Can it make far-reaching concessions in view of the public criticism it can anticipate? The alternative is to wait for a Fateh-Hamas agreement that comprises acceptance of a compromise deal with Israel. That would mean remaining tied to the Israel-Fateh-Hamas Gordian knot.- <i>Published 27/8/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
