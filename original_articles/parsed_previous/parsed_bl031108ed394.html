<b>bitterlemons:</b> What does it mean for negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis when the chief Israeli negotiator, Tzipi Livni, was unable to put together a functioning coalition?
<p>
<b>Salem:</b> On the one hand it means that those pushing for negotiations cannot form a government. But the second problem is that those pushing for negotiations are not ready for a political agreement. The problem in Israel is that those that are ready for an agreement are falling apart, while those on the right that do not want any agreement are in the ascendancy. In the middle there is Kadima, about whom one cannot be sure they want anything but negotiations. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> So is this the end of the Annapolis process?
<p>
<b>Salem:</b> Mahmoud Abbas has said he is ready to continue negotiations. But what shape the negotiations will take after the American elections, nobody knows. What is understood is that Barack Obama is ready to continue working on this track from day one and may push for a permanent status agreement. What John McCain wants is less certain, though a McCain presidency might lead to a continuation of the current policy of negotiations. 
<p>
Whatever the outcome of the US elections, progress depends on whether Kadima or Likud will win the elections. And even if Kadima leads a new government, it is not clear it will push for a permanent agreement, partly because it looks like it will need right wing parties to form a government and partly because it is not clear Kadima itself is ready for such an agreement. 
<p>
If we are talking about the promise to reach agreement by the end of the year, the Annapolis process is finished. It will end with the reports both sides present to the Quartet about those negotiations. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> You don't expect any surprises from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in the meantime?
<p>
<b>Salem:</b> I am doubtful. And even if it does happen, any agreement will not be implemented or rubber-stamped until Israeli elections. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> There are two apparent scenarios for the Israeli elections: either a Likud-led right wing government or a narrow Kadima-led government. Should Likud win, what are the consequences for negotiations?
<p>
<b>Salem:</b> The Likud will pursue negotiations with the Palestinians, but only negotiations about issues of security and economic development, not territorial issues. The Likud believes that before discussing territorial issues, the Palestinians need to promote democracy and fight "terrorism". Those are pre-conditions for the Likud, and they will demand them from Palestinians in any negotiations. This, of course, is just a verbal tactic to avoid any serious negotiations. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How will the US elections affect Israeli elections?
<p>
<b>Salem:</b> I see the two as being completely separate. The US has shown twice in the last eight years that it is powerless to pressure Israel to do what the latter is not willing to do, first when President George W. Bush asked Ariel Sharon to withdraw the Israeli army from the West Bank in 2002, which was completely ignored, and second when the administration promised an agreement by the end of this year. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How might the fact of Israeli elections affect Palestinian reconciliation talks? 
<p>
<b>Salem:</b> I think Palestinian reconciliation talks need to overcome mostly internal problems. Of the issues that they are discussing, including security reform, government make-up, PLO reform and when to hold elections, the Israeli dimension is minor, except in the extent to which Palestinian security forces should act in cooperation with Israel. All these problems go beyond the issue of negotiating with Israel. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> You don't think that with the outlook for negotiations seemingly poor with the new elections, this might act as a spur for unity? 
<p>
<b>Salem:</b> Not unity. It might help forge a fluid agreement maybe on a date for elections, but nothing more substantial.- <i>Published 3/11/2008 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
