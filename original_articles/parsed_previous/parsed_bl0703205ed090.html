The best way to calculate what is necessary to maintain and consolidate the ceasefire is to understand the causes of the violence. If we understand what causes the violence we can then work to neutralize these factors in the short term and remove them in the long term.<P>

>From a Palestinian perspective it is very simple: the cause of the violence is the Israeli occupation and the practices that arise as a result of this occupation. This is the exact opposite argument of the Israeli rationalization that the ongoing occupation is needed to end Palestinian violence. In addition, any Israeli act that aims to consolidate and maintain the occupation is an act of violence. Take for example the Israeli expansion of settlements. Expansion of settlements involves the violent seizure or confiscation of land, which in turn also negatively affects the economy and welfare of the Palestinian people.<P>

It is vital that Palestinians should feel and see a reversal of continuing Israeli activities to perpetuate the occupation to remove the need to try to end it violently. Furthermore, ending such activities--the expansion of settlements and outposts, the building of the separation wall and paving of settler bypass roads--will neutralize the time aspect and make it possible for people to continue in the short term with no negotiated final agreement.<P> If this time, however, is used to acquire more land and prejudice the possibility of independence, freedom, self-determination and statehood, then the time a ceasefire can be maintained without a final agreement will quickly run out. Palestinians will feel they have to act and different Palestinians will think of different ways, including responding to the violent means of consolidating the occupation with violent means to end the occupation.<P>

There is another important factor that has proved to be significant in causing violence. There is a well-established statistical correlation between an increase in poverty and unemployment on the one hand and an increase in extremism and radicalization on the other. This would appear to be a global phenomenon; it is definitely valid in the Palestinian case.<P> The policy of restricting the movement of Palestinians, the destruction of infrastructure and house demolitions in addition to the appropriation of land for settlement purposes are the major causes of the economic deterioration in the Palestinian areas and constitute the main obstacles to economic recovery. If Israel responds to Palestinian violence with economic sanctions the policy is backfiring, causing instead an increase in violence.<P>

For all these reasons, it is no coincidence that the first phase of the roadmap, which was meant to be a stabilization package, included three components. One concerns security, and includes a ceasefire and an end to violence among other measures. A second equally important component is an economic package to be realized both by increasing international economic support for the Palestinian economy and removing Israeli obstacles to economic recovery. Third is a political component that includes a complete cessation of settlement activity and the dismantlement of outposts. <P>

Without these latter two, the political and economic components, it is doubtful whether the current successful ceasefire can last. Since this current Israeli government is unhappy with the fact that the ceasefire is exposing its illegal practices to international criticism, it does not have any strong motivation to fulfill these other components in order to consolidate the ceasefire. That's why the international community led by the Quartet must take a leading role in ensuring the adherence of the two sides to all three components of the first phase of the roadmap.- <i>Published 7/3/2005 (c) bitterlemons.org </i><P>
