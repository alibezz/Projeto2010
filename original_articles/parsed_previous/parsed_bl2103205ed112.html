<b>bitterlemons:</b> What effects do you think might be felt here from events in Lebanon?<P>

<b>Agha:</b> It's clear that what's happening in Lebanon reflects American plans, and those of Israel and other US allies in Europe, for a "new" Middle East. To implement this plan after the Iraq war they have turned to Syria. Syria has now come under pressure, and to put the Syrian regime in the corner, they've asked it to withdraw its forces from Lebanon and end its support for Hizballah.<P> 

The main issue now is Hizballah. Hizballah is the main issue for the Israelis and by extension the US. If they manage to, as they put it, destroy the infrastructure of Hizballah in Lebanon, they will then turn to Hamas and Islamic Jihad and the other military factions in the Palestinian areas.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How could they do this?<P>

<b>Agha:</b> After the victory for Hizballah when Israel withdrew its forces from south Lebanon, Israel felt the group had become the main player there. Hizballah right now is the most powerful group among the many in Lebanon. The Christian and other minority groups like the Druze fear the power of Hizballah, and should the latter ally with the Sunnis, they will dominate the political situation in Lebanon. <P>

The US and its allies, particularly Israel, do not want this, but will face a lot of trouble if they try to dismantle the group. Hizballah is not a militia or an army. It has camps and bases, but is not easy to target. <P>

Here I don't think the factions will disarm in the coming period. There is no solution on the horizon, and no peace will be implemented. Only last night, Israel refused to give back the villages around Tulkarm, and it has delayed and delayed the security handovers.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you think the pressure on Syria will weaken Hamas and Islamic Jihad?

<b>Agha:</b> The Hamas and Jihad offices in Syria have been closed for a while now. There is no real action from these groups on Syrian territory. They may be acting from Lebanon or Qatar or some places around the Gulf. But in Syria there are no military camps and no real action. I don't think it will affect the situation here. If Israel and the US and their allies are trying to get Syria and Hizballah to change the way Hamas or Jihad act or work, they will fail.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> The way the international community has dealt with the issue has been very frustrating for Palestinians, who feel it has been adamant about UN resolutions and yet continues to treat Israel with kid gloves. Is that also your reaction?<P>

<b>Agha:</b> I agree, particularly when France and Germany joined in the chorus asking Syria to abide by UNSCR 1559. No one is pushing Israel to abide by any of the many UN resolutions on Israel. It shows that there is simply no fairness in international relations. It's political opportunism, particularly from France and Germany. The US doesn't care anyway, and will stand by Israel, especially at this time. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> We've seen a lot of popular protests in Lebanon and people have talked about democratization. Is there anything the Palestinians can learn from this?<P>

<b>Agha:</b> Palestinians will look at what's been happening recently, in Ukraine for instance or in Lebanon, and I believe these lessons will be remembered for the future. If anything is done against the people by the PA, in transgression of their human rights, people will take to the streets.<P>

But I also think that here people, especially the young people, still have some way to come in this respect. Too often violent protests are used, and I think people still need to learn to demonstrate and protest for their rights in a peaceful way, in the way of the Orange revolution in Ukraine. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is that possible under occupation?<P>

<b>Agha:</b> Yes. It's possible. It's possible to demonstrate against the occupation in this way and also against the Authority.- <i>Published 21/3/2005 (c) bitterlemons.org<P>
