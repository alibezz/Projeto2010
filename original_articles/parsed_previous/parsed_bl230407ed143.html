an interview with Samir Abdullah

</table><p>
  

 
 
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Many people said corruption was the main reason Hamas won parliamentary elections. Would you agree with that? <P>

<b>Abdullah:</b> I think it was the second main reason. The main reason was the crisis in the peace process. Of course corruption and the whole attitude and behavior of the Palestinian Authority, where a lot of mistakes--incompetence, general misbehavior--were made in addition to corruption, were major issues. The PA did not keep an eye out for what people wanted and what they needed. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> You seem to be saying that there are two things to distinguish, the problem in people's minds and the real problem. How big is the real problem?<P>

<b>Abdullah:</b> In terms of the number of corrupt officials it is actually very little. In terms of amounts, if you compare with other countries around us or in the world, it is nothing. But taking into account the psyche of the people and the situation we are living in, any amount of corruption at any level is unacceptable.<P>

Overall, revenues and expenditures in the Palestinian budget were known. Maybe they were not expended in the most efficient way, maybe revenue was not collected in the proper manner and, yes, there were a lot of accounts where revenue accrued, but most of it is accounted for. Some was not audited and that was a problem.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> In that respect, the reforms of 2000 and 2003, and especially the creation of the Single Treasury Account, were very important. To what extent would you credit the STA and those reforms with cleaning up the budget?<P>

<b>Abdullah:</b> Those reforms were crucial steps. The STA was not the only step; it was one of several major improvements. There was also budget reform, which created a budget to be approved by the Legislative Council and then adhered to by ministries. <P>

Before that, there was no adherence. There was some discussion about a so-called budget. But the budget wasn't a financial and economic plan for the government. There was no relationship between the budget and what the government was doing. The budget was just a statement that was never adhered to or honored. But with those reforms we got the STA and steps to formulate a proper budget that responded to needs and priorities and so on.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Now, and for a year, with international sanctions against the government, the STA lies dormant. What effect has this had?<P>

<b>Abdullah:</b> The STA is dormant because of the restrictions imposed on banks. Banks cannot deal with the government, accept revenues from the government or pay any checks to anybody from the government to fulfill its obligations. So banks had to close the STA and that was it. The government has to use different channels and donors have to use different mechanisms.<P>

This is a major blow to reforms. There is now no transparency and costs are up. In 2006, for example, the money coming through the Temporary International Mechanism was coming from donors straight to recipients but at a high cost, with each transaction at eight euros. This is expensive for both donors and us. In addition, while the money coming to the Office of the President is earmarked for specific projects, there is no statement to indicate where this money is going. <P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Does this not create the problem that in this situation the public's understanding of where the money is spent is limited and it is possible that the money is misappropriated?<P>

<b>Abdullah:</b> Of course. The rumors are already starting. And yes, the money could be used for corruption, as could the money that came in bags and from various sources. There is no oversight mechanism and this is a major blow to good governance.<P>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you see a parallel with Israel, where there are plenty of corruption scandals at the moment?<P>

<b>Abdullah:</b> Every year Israel has corruption scandals. But the system there is set up so as to be able to catch and check such cases. On our side, unfortunately, and in spite of all that has been said about the previous era in the years before the STA, no one has been caught for corruption and faced trial. This is a major difference.

We need several reforms. In addition to a strong judiciary and the re-establishment of the STA and other such reforms we need reform of the security sector. This is a major problem. Even with a functioning court system and economic reforms, these cannot be implemented if there is no competence in the security apparatuses. Security and judiciary reforms are a priority for corruption to be stamped out properly. There is also a lot of corruption in the security sector, where people used to be paid in cash.<P>

Overall, I think the corruption problem is not as big as it used to be, and it is certainly bigger in the public mind than in reality. With the new political competition in the PLC and in government, we have a system of checks and balances that will make it difficult for corrupt officials to get away with it. So there is a difference, but this difference still needs to be reinforced by real reform in the judiciary and security sectors. What we have now is still only an environment that makes corruption difficult.- <i>Published 23/4/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
