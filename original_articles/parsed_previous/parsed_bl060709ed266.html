<b>bitterlemons:</b> There are a lot of efforts at the moment to restart a political process between Palestinians and Israel. Can such a process gain any traction without some kind of participation of Hamas?
<p>
<b>Yousef:</b> I don't think any political process can succeed if we don't have national reconciliation. That comes first, and then we, as Palestinians, can decide on the rest of the issues. Mahmoud Abbas [Abu Mazen] has negotiated with Israel for many years, and these negotiations have achieved nothing. I don't think anyone will want to continue such negotiations. 
<p>
We have to achieve national reconciliation. Then we can decide on the direction, whether, for example, there will be negotiations with Israel as long as it continues its expansionist policy. Even Abu Mazen has said he will not talk to the Israelis while they are building settlements in the West Bank. So no one wants to talk to the Israelis, whether Hamas or Abu Mazen, for now. Nothing will happen at least until Israel stops its expansionist policies.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> There appears to be pressure on Israel from the US to end its settlement expansion. How real do you think this pressure is?
<p>
<b>Yousef:</b> It is good to hear that the US for the first time is trying to put some pressure on Israel, because the settlements are the greatest obstacle to any solution. Any chance for a Palestinian state will disappear if Israel continues with its settlement expansion. 
<p>
It is now the challenge for the US to prove if those wonderful words we heard recently from US President Barrack Obama can cause any change on the ground. We need to see tangible results on the issue of settlements. If the US succeeds in this, then Arab and Muslim confidence that the US can play an even-handed role will be restored. If such trust is built, then we can ourselves try to give the Americans some leverage to assume their role as honest brokers.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> What can the international community do to encourage the national unity talks in Cairo?
<p>
<b>Yousef:</b> Palestinians need national reconciliation. Without reconciliation there will be no recognized government and the division will continue. So everyone should push for national reconciliation. Such reconciliation will create a government that will first of all work toward holding the next elections. Once we have elections there will be a new government. 
<p>
I don't know who will win new elections, but it is unlikely that anyone will garner a clear majority. It is likely we will have a coalition government. Whoever joins such a government should be allowed to do so without foreign interference, and Hamas cannot accept any foreign interference in the way we have now with the Quartet conditions. And right now, these conditions are simply a hurdle in the way of national reconciliation.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How important would it be if the international community sent a clear signal that it would unconditionally deal with any Palestinian government?
<p>
<b>Yousef:</b> We've heard from many European and American sources that they will deal with a national unity government if we agree to one.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> But nothing has been made public. People say this through backchannels and in personal meetings, but there is still no clear public position...
<p>
<b>Yousef:</b> This is because the Obama administration is still clinging to these three [Quartet] conditions. But we have heard through backchannels that if there is a unity government and Hamas is a part, the US will not interfere and nor should anyone else. 
<p>
It is unfair, basically. These conditions are placed on the Palestinians, yet Israel does not respect the will of the world community and it does not respect or honor agreements signed with Palestinians. Why should the world take action only against the Palestinians and say nothing about Israeli violations?
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Recently, Khalid Mishaal came out very clearly saying he welcomed the new tone from the US and that Hamas would accept a Palestinian state on pre-1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital and the right of return of refugees. Do you think Hamas has gone as far as it can to convince the world that it can be a part of a political process?
<p>
<b>Yousef:</b> After hearing that speech, the world should open its channels and engage with Hamas in a serious discussion to reach a peaceful settlement. Hamas has shown enough ideological flexibility to convince the world that it can do business with Hamas. Hamas is part of the solution, not the problem. If there are serious intentions in Washington to solve the Palestinian issue, this is the right time.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> In view of that speech, how is Hamas' position different from the PLO position?
<p>
<b>Yousef:</b> We have never said we would surrender inalienable Palestinian rights, guaranteed by United Nations resolutions, including Resolution 194. We have accepted a state on pre-1967 borders, but the issue of refugees is an issue that we say must be part of the solution and cannot be neglected. The world needs to work seriously on this. What is the answer to the right of return, how can the issue be addressed and what should be done with the 6.5 million refugees? These questions must be answered in detail. 
<p>
Our political vision is based on a truce and there are still many details to solve. But in general, we have accepted a Palestinian state on pre-1967 borders. That should send the signal that we are willing to help the international community lay the foundation for a peaceful settlement to the conflict.- <i>Published 6/7/2009 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
