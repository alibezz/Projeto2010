
a conversation with Mudar Kassis

</table>

<p>
<B>bitterlemons:</B> What strikes you the most about this plan, given the current state of affairs?
<P>
<B>Kassis:</B> My very first impression is that it is a major indicator of Israeli failure. Sharon has failed to pass his initial plan, on the one hand because of the vote in the Likud, on the other hand because it was obviously impossible to implement unilaterally.
<P>
Last, the plan seems not to have clarified for the Israeli political elite whether this will put them in any better place in the near future. 
<P>
<B>bitterlemons:</B> What are the implications for the Palestinian Authority?
<P>
<B>Kassis:</B> I don't think that there are many implications, strategically speaking. 
<P>
Technically speaking, there are many things still unclear. For example, the plan states that Israel would no longer be responsible for the Gaza Strip as an occupying force. Nonetheless, [Israel] will be controlling the borders, airspace, any possibility for third-party intervention, and humanitarian needs. 
<P>
The situation will again be that the Gaza Strip will not be free to act. Palestinians will not be free to act. 
<P>
On the other hand, there will be a deepening of the current situation whereby Israel is legally bound to be responsible for the situation in the occupied territories, but is actually doing nothing vis-a-vis this responsibility. 
<P>
<B>bitterlemons:</B> What are the implications for the long term?
 <P>
<B>Kassis:</B> What can be read in the plan is not so different from the Oslo arrangements--only the fact that the area to be evacuated from Israeli presence will be a little larger. 
<P>
Israel is still securing the crossing points to Egypt, the access to the sea, there is mention of activities along the coastline, and mention of military infrastructure being transferred to a third party authorized-obviously--by Israel.
<P>
I see really no difference between this and what was happening in [the Oslo agreements], aside from minor quantitative differences. Too, Oslo occurred in an atmosphere of supposed good intentions and good will from both parties, and the atmosphere now is one of bad intentions and distrust.
<P>
<B>bitterlemons:</B> One of the comments that we keep hearing is the fear that the Gaza Strip will become the playground of Hamas. Is that an accurate assessment?
<P>
<B>Kassis:</B> I don't believe so. First of all, I am not sure that Hamas is in a position to take control in the Gaza Strip, and second, even if it were, I am not sure that it would want to. 
<P>
Third, I am not sure this is such a major concern for Israel. Do you imagine that if Israel were concerned about this, it would be acting unilaterally?
<P>
<B>bitterlemons:</B> Do you think Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is serious about this plan?
<P>
<B>Kassis:</B> Yes, I think that he is extremely serious about finding a way out of the deep trouble that he has got Israel into. The situation in Israel has deteriorated economically, politically, internationally. Sharon has come to the conclusion that his old dreams are not realizable and he is seeking ways out. That is the part that he is serious about, not the plan.
<P>
The plan is one of his experiments as far as I can see, and the more steps there are, the more experimental it is. 
<P>
The only thing that the plan really does is create a new demographic reality. The security dimension is really debatable--I don't know how they define it. The economic situation depends on the West Bank, mainly. 
<P>
But the demographic situation, based on widening the Philadelphi route and solidifying control over some West Bank territories, seems the only sort of "progress" that Sharon has accomplished in this plan. And that existed in the old plan, as well.
