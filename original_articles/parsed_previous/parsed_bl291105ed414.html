"It is a dream come true for us to be here to celebrate the reopening of the Rafah terminal as a free crossing between us and our brothers in Egypt." With these solemn words, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas opened the Rafah crossing last Saturday, minutes before he stamped his diplomatic passport with the "free-of-Israeli-security" stamp. It was an historic event, albeit still a reversible one, in the long process of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  <P>

This development was achieved after US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice concluded a frustrating negotiating process between the parties and Quartet special coordinator James Wolfensohn, forcing Israel and the Palestinian Authority to sign an agreement that officially introduces the concept of an active third party role in post-disengagement Gaza. <P>

This concept isn't new. During the months leading to disengagement, various informal negotiations took place among Israelis, Palestinians and international representatives to plan and design the "day after". It was evident that addressing the Israeli interest in ending the occupation while ensuring security and the Palestinian interest in free access to and from Gaza would require an active international role. "At the border with Egypt, it is envisioned that there would be a Palestinian-manned immigration and customs office together with international personnel responsible for weapons search and entry denial to blacklisted individuals", we wrote in September 2004, a group of Israelis and Palestinians under the auspices of the Toledo International Center for Peace.<P>

When Israeli experts first considered this idea, the politicians were reluctant. For the leadership, conceding any security to a third party requires a careful gradualism, having in mind the lawless violent environment of Gaza and failed experiences with UN forces in Lebanon. This gradualism is embodied in the "Agreement on Movement and Access" regarding the Gaza crossings, and it marks a change in Israel's approach toward the role of third parties.<P>

More active international involvement is a direct result of realities on the ground, both regional and global. A weak Palestinian governing system and the unilateral disengagement approach held by the Israeli leadership have created the space for international involvement. The nation-building campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq have added significant experience and "lessons learned" within the international community. Today, an international model could assist the Palestinians in their nation-building while leaving space for negotiated arrangements with Israel. <P>

An active international involvement, when negotiated with Israel, enhances Israel's long term interests as it assists it to gradually overcome the "occupier" mentality without posing an irreversible constraint on its freedom to fight terrorism. International involvement is also crucial in supporting capacity-building on the Palestinian side, which is an Israeli medium-term interest. Despite what some of the critics argue, Israel is depositing neither its security nor its foreign policy in the hands of a third party, nor did it do so in Lebanon. But it could and should use modern models of international involvement to better manage the conflict, until it is ripe for resolution.<P>

Moreover, this agreement indicates a significant shift in the positioning of the international community regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The dignitaries who participated in this process represent the three emerging pillars of constructive international involvement: legitimacy, mediation and implementation. Wolfensohn represents the required international legitimacy for any arrangements between Israelis and Palestinians, a legitimacy that could be gained solely through consensus among international actors and their negotiations with the parties. Condoleezza Rice represents the sole mediator who can strategically deliver the parties--a performance dependant on the extent it correlates with US national interests. <P>

The third and equally important pillar is the role of implementation. This is the role that requires the parties' trust, the ability to accurately read realities and adjust policies accordingly, and the talent to facilitate endless mini-negotiations with patience and responsibility and to guarantee the implementation of agreements reached. Egypt and the EU are currently the implementers, watchfully learning their new role.<P> 
 
In the near future, as a consequence of deep currents within the two societies, the conflict will remain in a "low-to-no trust" environment. This should force Israelis and Palestinians to seek not trust or a final status agreement, but rather gradual arrangements that a) allow a visible process of capacity-building on the Palestinian side; b) construct mutual respect, which is significantly different than trust; and c) encourage the international community to serve as an implementer and guarantor of good-faith implementation of agreed arrangements.<P>

Back to Rafah. The Saturday crossing of 1,600 Palestinians to Egypt is only one element, though the first and a very symbolic one, among several arrangements agreed by the parties. Unfortunately, like any agreement this one includes many "good-will clauses", "implementation committees" and "constructive ambiguity" that in our case tend to become "destructive certainties". Still, there is reason for optimism in the introduction of this new element in the Israeli-Palestinian system: an active, on-the-ground, third party role. In this context, the Rafah crossing should be seen as a "mini-pilot" toward crucial Palestinian success in Gaza.- <i>Published 28/11/2005 &copy; bitterlemons.org<P>
