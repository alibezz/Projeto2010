
an interview with Mahmoud Zahhar

</table>
<p>

<b>bitterlemons:</b> How would Hamas assess the progress and advantages of the ceasefire at this time?
<p>
<b>Zahhar:</b> Up to this moment, Israel has violated all of the conditions of the ceasefire, continuing with its killing, its demolition of houses and refusing to release the prisoners. Still, the Palestinian people remain committed to the ceasefire one hundred percent. We are watching the Israeli side, recording what the Israelis are saying and doing, and if it becomes necessary, we will return to an effective armed struggle.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Under what conditions will the ceasefire be discontinued?
<p>
<b>Zahhar:</b> First, there is the three-month deadline, which we are sticking to. Second, if Israel were to carry out a massive violation, such as an invasion or dramatic killing, then we would have to consider ending the ceasefire.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Do you maintain the public’s support in this?
<p>
<b>Zahhar:</b> We have the public’s support; we even maintain the support of the international community. The European Union has even decided not to consider Hamas a terrorist organization.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How would you assess the government of Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas and the progress on the <a href="http://www.bitterlemons.org/docs/roadmap3.html">roadmap</a>?
<p>
<b>Zahhar:</b> As of yet, this Palestinian government has been unable to achieve the base demands of Palestinians. This government is working hard, but has nothing to show for it yet. To my mind, if Mahmoud Abbas can’t produce the basic requirements demanded by the Palestinian people, he will resign.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why is the prisoner issue so important, even though it is not a part of the roadmap?
<p>
<b>Zahhar:</b> This is one of the tender points in Palestinian society. Since this Israeli government has taken office, it has slowly deprived as many as 70 basic rights from the prisoners. They are not allowed visits from their families and lawyers, they live off of the food given them by their families, and their clothes are those that their families have sent for them. They have been prevented from living as human beings. Therefore, the release of these prisoners is one of the most important demands of the Palestinian people.
<p>
Israel has said that it will release some prisoners, but we will not be deceived. We have lists and we are ready to give the names of those we want released. We will not be tricked. If the Israeli government is going to mislead us on this issue, the response will be a violent one and we will return to the effective armed struggle. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Does Hamas ever imagine a time when it will be in the Palestinian government and the only parties carrying weapons on Palestinian streets will be the Palestinian police?
<p>
<b>Zahhar:</b> Yes, when our land is liberated. When we achieve sovereignty, we will demand free elections. If the Palestinian people vote for Hamas in the elections, then we will be in the government--not in an autonomy--but in a sovereign Palestinian state. At that time, the Palestinian army will carry guns and will defend the Palestinian borders, not like now where the Palestinian police are expected to spy on their own people for Israel.
