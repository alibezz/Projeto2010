<b>bitterlemons:</b> Why do you think the public statements of the negotiators in the lead-up to Annapolis have changed to focus on the roadmap?
<p>
<b>Shurab:</b> I believe that this concentration on the roadmap may not be useful for the Palestinian side because the roadmap provides pretence for Israel not to continue the political negotiations process. 
<p>
In its first phase, [the roadmap] calls on Palestinians to put an end to various types of resistance, what is called "weapons-collection" from the militias, and to "destroy the infrastructure" of the Palestinian organizations. In any case, this is a basic need for Palestinians at this time. Simultaneously, it calls on the Israelis to stop the construction of settlements. 
<p>
The current concentration on the roadmap seems to stem from the Arab initiative that was adopted at the two Arab summits, Beirut and Riyad. The roadmap is also a focus because it represents the international initiative of the Quartet, and reflects the most general and broad outlines of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and ongoing positions. It was announced four years ago, and I think it now incorporates many transformations and developments.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Is it possible then, to build new negotiations on the roadmap?
<p>
<b>Shurab:</b> It is not difficult to negotiate on the basis of the roadmap if the basic elements are present. The question is, are the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations now and in Annapolis at the end of this month occurring in an environment suitable and appropriate to push them forward? The point is that the negotiations environment includes Israel's political requirements, those of the United States, and in the Palestinian sphere--Palestinian-Palestinian negotiations--and of course, the Arab environment. 
<p>
In general, the environment is not in favor of the Palestinian party, and is not even in favor of a fair negotiations process.  Are the Americans going to play a fair role in the coming negotiations? I believe that American political agendas regarding nuclear weapons in Iran and the situation in Iraq will take precedence. 
<p>
It has been difficult in recent years for the American administration to truly play a role in a complicated peace process such as the Arab-Israel conflict. The negotiations require strong international political will as well as desire on the part of both of the negotiating partners themselves--the Israelis and Palestinians.  
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> And Israeli and Palestinian capabilities?
<p>
<b>Shurab:</b> I think that both sides, the Palestinians and Israelis, do not have the ability to push the political process forward. Especially the Israeli side, because it is being asked in this stage of the negotiations to progress to the next stage, and to take a clearer political stand concerning the Palestinian state, the issue of Jerusalem, the settlements and other main issues. The current Israeli government incorporates the settlers and the right-wing, and [Defense Minister Ehud] Barak and [former prime minister] Netanyahu are gearing up for the position of prime minister. Thus, Olmert is in a weak position to take decisive decisions relating to the negotiations process. 
<p>
On the Palestinian side, I can't imagine the success of the negotiations process when there is this state of fragmentation between Gaza's de facto government and the government in the West Bank. In addition to this, Abu Mazen has only one year remaining in his presidency. The question is: is this enough--for Abu Mazen, for George Bush, for Olmert himself?
<p>
I believe that this next year might witness dangerous developments that do not advance the negotiations process. There are the American presidential elections, which the Zionist lobby is concentrating on. And there should also be Palestinian presidential elections next year. There are also problems in Israel, where Olmert is being investigated on several charges of corruption. This is the negative perspective. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> And the positive perspective? 
<p>
<b>Shurab:</b> There are things cooking that make the success of the process more likely. First, there is the Arab initiative, which extends relations once Israel has withdrawn from Arab land. President Bush, according to US law, can use his powers and pressure Israel. Olmert, for his part, needs to bring his public a declaration--not Palestinian, but Arab. 
<p>
The importance of the presence of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at Annapolis is crucial. This is a first. I imagine it has great meaning for the Israeli citizen. This is a trump card that the Palestinian president can use to advance the negotiations.
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> There is the opinion that Annapolis is a great risk for those who are seeking to broaden the Palestinian receptiveness to peace negotiations, and in fact could damage these interests. Your view?
<p>
<b>Shurab:</b> I think that the Palestinian side, the half a million people that gathered in Gaza on the day of the third memorial for Yasser Arafat, sent a clear message in support of President Mahmoud Abbas' position. 
<p>
But extremism is blocking the opportunities that the Annapolis conference is meant to capitalize on. Successive Israeli governments have posed obstacles to the trust needed for establishing a serious peace conference. We have to differentiate between the Palestinian position concerning the peace process and the [objective] possibilities for developing the process.-<i> Published 19/11/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org </i>
