In "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", Friedrich Nietzsche's false prophet announced the famous dictum about the "death of God". Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu yesterday announced the death of hopes for peace and a Palestinian state. No Palestinian refugee right of return. No Jerusalem for the Palestinians. No freeze to settlement building. No sovereign airspace, no real Palestinian sovereignty at all. 
<p>
And it gets worse. According to Netanyahu, the Palestinians have no historic roots or rights in Palestine. The Palestinians just happen to be there. For Netanyahu, the West Bank is the biblical land of the Jewish forefathers, going back to Abraham, and belongs to no one else. This is his response to US President Barack Obama's demand to freeze the settlements. All Israeli governments have supported the settlers' colonizing projects. Dividing Jewish colonies in the West Bank into "legal" and "illegal" settlements is intended solely to mislead the world. All of them, with no exception, are illegal under international law.
<p>
Why is it that interfaith trialogue stresses Abraham as our common father if Palestinian Christians and Muslims are not recognized as his children on equal footing? Is it because the mother of the Arabs, Hagar, was a slave girl? This is 3,500-year-old thinking. When convenient, Abraham is used as a cushion, a sort of a comfort zone, to avoid the real issues on the ground. The history of Palestine did not begin with Abraham. Even in the Old Testament, when Abraham arrived in the Holy Land, there were Palestinians. When Abraham needed to bury Sara, he did not claim any divine right to own the land; he paid 400 silver shekels to the Palestinians.
<p>
Claiming to share US President Barack Obama's vision for peace (Obama welcomed Netanyahu's speech as an important step), Netanyahu called on the Palestinian leadership to return to negotiations "without any preconditions", a euphemism for rejecting all relevant UN resolutions and previous understandings, including the roadmap. This is a clear setback to the work of the Quartet, as well as to the Arab Peace Initiative. The Palestinian Authority, however, is doing nothing except recycling the "no partner for peace" mantra, throwing it back at Israeli leaders. 
<p>
Netanyahu also promoted his notion of economic peace. He wants Arabs not only to recognize Israel as a Jewish state, but also to invest in Israel. He wants full normalization without offering anything in return. He talked about tourism and mentioned Christian religious sites with no mention of Muslim sites. He talked about utilizing solar energy and laying pipelines to Africa and Europe, as if all roads lead to Tel Aviv. There is no mention of an end to the Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights, but he is willing to go to Damascus. This man cannot be serious.
<p>
Netanyahu presented an image of a peaceful Israeli society. The root of the problem, he claimed, was Arab rejection of the Jews' right to a national home in their historic land. Of course, nothing is mentioned about the colonial nature of the Zionist project or the misery it caused for the Palestinian people and others for over 60 years. 
<p>
All the problems, according to Netanyahu, come from without. This includes his blurb about Iran's nuclear threat. If Netanyahu truly shares the vision of President Obama, then he should talk about a world without nuclear weapons, including getting rid of Israel's nuclear arsenal. This is the opposite of what Netanyahu is demanding; his call for "strong security guarantees" is a euphemism for nuclear power. 
<p>
Speaking at the Begin-Sadat Center at Bar Ilan University was a further ironic twist. The deal between Israel and Egypt was based on withdrawing from Egyptian land that was occupied in 1967. The same logic should apply to the Syrian Golan Heights, the Lebanese Sheba Farms, and the Palestinian Gaza Strip and West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Rather than comparing himself to Theodor Herzl, as if he was making a historical speech, Netanyahu should have compared himself to Menachem Begin, who understood the land-for-peace formula.
<p>
Netanyahu's demands are impossible. They could be shared only by his right-wing coalition. If he does not change his position, which is unlikely, the world has to wait until the next Israeli government before hopes of peace may be rekindled.- <i>Published 15/6/2009 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
