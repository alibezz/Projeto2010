<p>
<b>Abdel Razeq:</b> We have received information that the prisoners halted their strike because they reached certain understandings with the Israeli authorities. None of us want a return to the hunger strike and we would never wish for this. However, if they do not receive any response to their demands for simple every day basic necessities and if conditions in the prisons are not returned to what they were a year and a half ago, then the situation will become very difficult and nobody will be able to prevent the prisoners from resisting in order to improve their living conditions. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Prisoners say some of their demands have been met, while the Israelis deny this. What is the score? What demands have been met, and why are the Israelis denying this?
<p>
<b>Abdel Razeq:</b> This is all part of the negotiations between the prisoners and the prison authorities. We are here to give them support but we were never part of the negotiations. To know exactly what went on [in the negotiations] will take some time, and therefore it will be a while before we know what demands were met and what are the issues still pending. We have to wait before we judge anything and give it time. Until now, we don't have any details. Anyway, an issue like this cannot come to an end overnight--it needs time, so we must be patient and see what their negotiations brought about. As far as we know, the negotiations are still ongoing. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> How effective do you feel the strike was?
<p>
<b>Abdel Razeq:</b> Strikes are one of the legal avenues for prisoners and the strike is one form of revolutionary resistance. This means that anyone who supports freedom in the world should stand by them and anyone with a conscience should give them support because this is a very civilized way of rebellion. Because strikes are legal, peaceful and civilized, they have always given positive results. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Both Palestinian officials and the Palestinian public have in word or deed shown solidarity with the prisoners. How effective do you feel the strike was in this regard?
<p>
<b>Abdel Razeq:</b> Of course there was support from them because the prisoners are their people--they are their sons, their brothers, their sisters, their colleagues--who are fighting in their own way. So the people no doubt will stand behind them. This is the least the people can do for the prisoners. 
<p>
So, one success of the strike is that it reactivated the Palestinian street all over the homeland, and all the sectors participated to show their support. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> Some prisoners would have been on hunger strike for over two weeks. How is their health?
<p>
<b>Abdel Razeq:</b> The prisoners who were on hunger strike for this period were undergoing very difficult health conditions. However, now, four days after the strike was called off, their health is gradually returning to normal. 
<p>
<b>bitterlemons:</b> In general, what impact do the prisoners and their activities have on Palestinian society? 
<p>
<b>Abdel Razeq:</b> At present there are 7,500 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Of these 450 are children and 1,700 are administrative detainees. The remainder has been sentenced or is awaiting sentencing. The prisoners represent the conscience of the people, and people's support is what gives prisoners their strength and determination.- Published 6/9/2004 (c) bitterlemons.org
