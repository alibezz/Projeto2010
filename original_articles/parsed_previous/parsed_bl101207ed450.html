Two recent developments have brought to the fore the issue of the Palestinian citizens of Israel. Last week an Israeli human rights organization published the results of a survey showing that racism against the Palestinians of Israel is growing. At the Annapolis conference, meanwhile, US President George W. Bush dealt a severe blow to their aspirations for equal social, economic and national rights in Israel. 
<p>
In general, Palestinians in Israel--a sizeable minority of 20 percent composed of both Muslims and Christians--have been supportive of the peace process since it started. They strongly supported, through their Knesset members, the Israeli parties or leaders who needed parliamentary support for their engagement in the peace process. These legislators in some cases even provided safety nets for such Israeli leaders against the threats of right wing opposition parties. On many occasions, Palestinian citizens of Israel mediated between the Palestinian leadership, when it was still in exile, and Israel in a way that facilitated confidence between the two sides. At the same time they have consistently resisted opposition to the peace process both in the Palestinian and Israeli spheres. 
<p>
There have been two recent occasions when certain political ideas provoked the community. The first was when certain Israeli think tanks and later politicians proposed to shift the borders of any final agreement to include parts of populated Palestinian areas in Israel and include them within the Palestinian state. This was a suggestion borne of a desire to rid Israel of its Palestinian citizens. It was strongly rejected, and without much argument the idea was dropped and is very rarely heard now.
<p>
The second is the recent shocking announcement by President George W. Bush in his opening speech at the Annapolis conference in support of the Israeli concept that Israel is a Jewish state. This announcement--in the face of Palestinian, Arab and Israeli Arab opposition--is perceived as a threat that could dramatically marginalize the position of the Palestinians in Israel.
<p>
This is especially significant in view of the already marginalized status of the Palestinians of Israel, a status inflicted by the discriminatory policies of the Israeli state and its Jewish majority. Last week, the Association of Civil Rights in Israel issued its annual report that warned of a rising racist attitude of a majority of the Jewish citizens of Israel, especially among the younger generation, against the Palestinian citizens of Israel. 
<p>
Annapolis has little impact on anything apart from this, including on the Palestinians of Israel. Definitely it has little impact on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in general. Within a political context, Palestinians in Israel have considerable interest in political progress between the Palestinians and Arabs on the one hand and Israel on the other. The failure of Annapolis to achieve any political progress and the subsequent failure to ensure the commitment of the parties to the tenets of the roadmap, perfectly illustrated by the failure of the US to prevent Israel from issuing tenders to build new houses in settlements on occupied territory, will reflect negatively on many aspects of the conflict but perhaps especially on the interests and general situation of the Palestinian citizens of Israel, caught, as they are, at the heart of the conflict. 
 <p>
The deepening of the hatred and hostility against them that will result from the failure to ensure progress at Annapolis will deepen the agony the Palestinians in Israel face in terms of discrimination by the Israeli state and the Jewish majority. Hence, of all interested parties, the Palestinians of Israel perhaps stands to lose the most as a consequence of the adoption by Washington of the Israeli demand to be recognized as a Jewish state. 
<p>
The Palestinian citizens of Israel could play an important role in the future. They are part of the Palestinian and Arab people but also consider themselves citizens of the state of Israel. They can with good cause claim to be able to understand the situation and mentality on both sides. This puts them in a position to play a constructive role in building relations between the two sides. On the other hand, if they continue to be marginalized and discriminated against, and if their economic and social situation continue to deteriorate, this will only contribute to the radicalization process that has afflicted them over the last few years.<i>- Published 10/12/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org</i>
