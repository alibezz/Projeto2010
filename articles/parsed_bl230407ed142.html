The connection between corruption and the conflict is an insidious one, even when it seems to produce "good" outcomes. 

It is hard to escape the conclusion, for example, that there was some relationship between the announcement by Ariel Sharon of his revolutionary unilateral disengagement plan in late 2003 and the corruption charges that swirled around him at that time. The desire to create a political distraction, however, could just as easily have manifested itself in the form of military action. Desperate leaders do desperate things, and we should not be surprised when policies colored by such ulterior motives turn out badly. 

Corruption can be a catalyst for good or bad policies. The more common and powerful arrow of causality, however, goes in the other direction: conflict perpetuates corruption.

Since Israel's founding, to a greater or lesser degree our existential struggle has dominated our politics. At times of relative peace or confidence on this front, domestic issues have come to the fore, but this has tended to be the exception that proves the rule. 

"Corruption" falls in the general basket of domestic issues, along with the economy, education, the environment, and many other matters that are the main stuff of politics in most other democracies. Sharon's case was a classic one of a debate over diplomatic strategy completely trumping concerns over a leader's political hygiene. 

In essence, the Israeli public has behaved as if concerns over corruption, along with many other "domestic" issues, are a luxury that it can only afford to address if more important things are not at stake. The neglect of many domestic issues, therefore, is an additional cost imposed by our unsettled security situation and the lack of consensus over how to address it.

The same might be said about the Palestinian side and about Arab countries, only more so. Throughout the Arab world, the main use of perpetuating the conflict with Israel is to distract from dictatorial rule. And dictatorships, in addition to depriving peoples of both freedom and prosperity, are naturally and irredeemably corrupt. 

Dictatorships combine excessive power with insufficient accountability, so it should be no surprise that "corrupt" is the word that is perhaps most often used to describe "dictatorship". In the long run, it is impossible to address corruption and many other problems in dictatorships without changing the system of government. Clean government can only exist on a foundation of the rule of law; not the law of a police state, but one that holds the government accountable to the people. 

It so happens that the sort of governments that are needed to root out corruption are also those that are needed to make peace. This is so because dictatorships will always need conflict to distract from corruption and other failures. 

Though in democracies the opposite might occur, namely peace initiatives used to mask corruption, the Sharon case is misleading. The current situation is more the norm, where weak leadership and corruption go together. 

A major component of leadership is adeptness at both earning and spending political capital. Most leaders under a cloud of corruption are unable to accumulate political capital and therefore have no capital to spend when it is needed most, such as when trying to build support for either diplomatic or military initiatives. 

Peace, however, does not await another Israeli initiative. It should be more evident than usual after disengagement and the rise of Hamas that peace depends not on Israeli initiatives but on an international realization that the Arab side must abandon the dream of Israel's destruction. The weakness of the current Israeli government, partly due to corruption, decreases its ability to make this case, and is therefore bad for peace.

That said, the Arab side should know that even a weak Israeli government is in many ways stronger than the fragile dictatorships that typify the Arab world. This is not just true militarily and economically, but in terms of ability to respond to an authentic Arab peace initiative, if one were to emerge. 

Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt could jump-start a real peace process any time they want. Just as it is almost impossible for dictatorships to offer real peace, it is almost impossible for a democracy to refuse one. 

Arab leaders should know that the basic willingness to set foot in Jerusalem, as Anwar Sadat did, would create a popular Israeli tsunami that no Israeli leader could resist, even if he/she wanted to. If the Arab world truly wanted to end its rejection of Israel, the popularity of the current leadership would be irrelevant to Israel's ability to reciprocate, which would be grounded in a popular consensus stronger than any government and would be automatic and irresistible.- Published 23/4/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org
