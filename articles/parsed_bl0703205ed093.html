As a journalist, I covered the Sharm al-Sheikh summit on February 9, 2005.


Avi Pazner, acting in his capacity as press spokesman for the prime minister of Israel, was very clear at the summit when he declared that "Sharon and Abbas will not sign anything".  Gideon Meir, acting in the capacity of spokesman of the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated throughout the day that "there will be no ceasefire proclaimed here today". 


Israeli government officials were adamant in saying that the condition for any such ceasefire would be for Abbas to dissolve terrorist organizations, to collect all their weapons, and to arrest any and all wanted terrorists.


However, what followed the Sharm summit was a torrent of press reports that conveyed the idea that Mahmoud Abbas had condemned terror activity and was working hard to stop it, thereby giving the world the impression that the new Palestinian leader was trying to sustain the ceasefire. Yet reports of official Palestinian Authority condemnation of terror activity are far from the truth.


Dr. Michael Widlanski, who holds a PhD on the subject of the Palestinian media, notes the following:


 Voice of Palestine radio, the official mouthpiece of the PA, went out of its way to trumpet the view that the Feb. 25 Tel Aviv nightclub attack did not involve a civilian target but rather was a carefully calculated operation designed to attack "an elite Israeli army unit" and "a very senior military officer". 

 Both Voice of Palestine radio and official Palestinian Authority television downplayed any mention of "condemnation" of the attack but rather cited the official statement by the Palestinian news agency that criticized the "explosive operation" in Tel Aviv for "sabotaging" Palestinian policy goals, such as the early release of convicted Palestinian terrorists from Israeli jails. 

 PA leader Abbas himself did not appear on official PA radio or television to "condemn" the Tel Aviv attack.
 
 None of the Palestinian broadcast media or major newspapers--Al-Quds, Al-Ayyam, Al-Hayat al-Jadida--referred to the Tel Aviv attack as "terror". They all referred to it as amaliyyat tafjeeriyya--"explosive operation"--or even amaliyyat istish-haadiyya, "heroic martyrdom operation". All three newspapers are tightly monitored and subsidized by Abbas and his top aides. 

 Two of the newspapers ran huge portraits of the suicide bomber who murdered the five people, including two women, in Tel Aviv. One of the newspapers (Hayat al-Jadida from Abbas' own Fatah organization) even described the bomber as "the operation operator, the martyr Abdullah Badran". 


This Palestinian rendition of events was in line with the February 6 Fatah Revolutionary Council meeting headed by Abbas that advocated an end to "operations against civilians" but specifically still called for "resistance operations" against Israeli civilians [settlers] in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as against Israeli military and police anywhere. That same Fatah resolution--issued only two days before the Israeli-Palestinian summit in Sharm al-Sheikh--also specifically called for attacks on those helping to build Israel's security fence, even civilian workers.

  
Moreover, to fan the flames of violence, when an Israeli soldier shot a Palestinian assailant the dead attacker was hailed as a shaheed or "martyr" in the Palestinian press, which called the man's death "cold-blooded murder" or "an execution". 

 
Similarly, the killing of a Palestinian school girl in a Gaza school yard on January 31 was declared to be the work of Israeli soldiers when, in fact, the girl was accidentally shot by Muslim pilgrims returning from Mecca who carelessly fired celebratory shots in the air. The Palestinian media "celebrated" the girl's martyrdom for three days with inflammatory articles, front-page pictures and cartoons all depicting the Israelis as bloodthirsty child-murderers.


In neither of these two cases--nor in half a dozen others in the last six weeks--did the Abbas-controlled Palestinian media even try to tell the real story.

 
This use of the "atrocity story" or what some might see as a "blood libel" has come to replace the crude and bloody video film clips on Palestinian television that were a hallmark of the era of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader for nearly 40 years.


In short, less than a month after the Sharm summit, it would be fair to say that the Palestinian Authority did not even go through the motions of sustaining a semblance of a ceasefire. 


No ceasefire was ever agreed to at the Sharm summit. Some people in the public relations departments of both sides tried to make it look like a ceasefire. The reality on the ground is that Mahmoud Abbas has no pretensions about sustaining a ceasefire.- Published 7/3/2005 (c) bitterlemons.org
