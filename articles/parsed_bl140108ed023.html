Seventy years, and the fundamental "Force of Circumstances" has not changed much. "An irrepressible conflict" is still raging "between two national communities, within the narrow bounds of a small country". The Arabs are still "in strife, open or latent" with the Jews, not only in Nablus and Jerusalem, but also in Jaffa and Umm al-Fahm. The conflict is not only political. As in 1937, "there is no common ground between them... their cultural and social life, their way of thought and conduct are as incompatible as their national aspirations."

The essential difference, today as in the 1930s and 1940s, is their respective attitude toward historic compromise on the conflicting claims to the same land: while the Jews accept its inevitability, often even desirability, the Palestinian Arabs reject it even when they pretend to embrace the "two state solution". This is not because Jews are better or smarter. They simply understand that they cannot impose their will over hundreds of millions of Arabs and Muslims and they don't want to subvert the democratic nature of their open society. 

The Palestinians and their radical Arab supporters, on the other hand, are confident that their side must ultimately prevail and impose an exclusively Arab reality on the whole region. The concept of partition--pioneered in 1937, adopted by the international community in 1947 and realized by the Jewish victory in 1948/49--is ultimately adopted by the Jews, who seek historic compromise, and invariably rejected by the Palestinian Arabs, who seek historic justice.

This is not because Jewish leaders are always of yielding stock while Palestinian leaders are stubborn by nature. The roots go much deeper into the political culture of both national communities. Even ideologically committed hardliners like Begin, Sharon and Olmert (let alone Ben Gurion, Eshkol and Rabin) came to fundamentally reconsider their lifelong insistence on historic justice for the Jews when they assumed the position of supreme responsibility and identified a chance to promote historic compromise. By contrast, a Palestinian leadership could never politically survive abandoning the claim for ultimate historic justice for the Arabs by institutionalizing the recognition of the Jewish nation-state alongside their own and disclaiming the "right of return". 

The Zionists were prepared in 1947 to establish their state without Zion (Jerusalem), which focused Jewish aspirations for millennia. Six decades later, with Jerusalem firmly under its control, the Israeli government forbids individual Jews to even move their lips while praying alone on the Temple Mount, let alone to congregate or pray aloud in the most sacred place in Jewish history. The Palestinians, by contrast, negate the very existence of Jewish history in Jerusalem--Arafat told Clinton that there was no Jewish temple there--and demand exclusive control over the mount (incidentally, Jerusalem is not even mentioned in the Koran). All this does not make Jews kinder or more considerate. They simply internalize the imperative of compromise even when it comes to their holy of holies. Palestinian justice leaves no room for that.

The 1937 report is a grim document boldly recognizing the incompatibility of Jewish and Arab aspirations. The state of affairs seven decades later presents us both with a much more pessimistic reality in one department and with far more optimistic features in another. It should not come as a surprise that the first reflects the costs (not to say the punishment) of proud adherence to complete historic justice, while the second relates to the benefits and rewards of accepting painful historic compromises.

The useless suffering that the Palestinian leadership and elites inflicted on their own people and on all they encountered (Jews, Jordanians, Lebanese and victims of terrorism worldwide) is a direct product of their obsession with justice. Had they been willing to accept the inevitable historic compromise, they could have had a Palestinian state in 1947 in much more than today's West Bank and Gaza Strip. Thirty years ago, before most of the settlements were even established, they could have developed PM Menachem Begin's autonomy into a sovereign state of their own (Arafat himself said as much). Seven years ago, they were offered a state over 97 percent of the territories, with Jerusalem as a capital, control over the Temple Mount and $40 billion for refugee resettlement. Had they substituted the unrealistic quest for ultimate justice with a viable compromise, they could have offered three generations of their children a promising future. 

The present reality is more grim than that of 1937 not only because these generations lost this chance, but also because the present day Palestinian leadership and elites who enjoy popular support are as irresponsible as those who inflicted calamity on their people in the 1930s and 1940s. Today, not only the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are unwilling to accept and recognize a Jewish nation-state alongside their own Palestinian Arab nation-state; even the Palestinian citizens of the state of Israel consider the Jewish nation-state an illegitimate colonial entity. The Palestinian version of a two-state solution is to partition historic Palestine between one state that will be exclusively Arab to begin with, and another that will initially be not-Jewish, imbued with demographic ("return") mechanisms that will soon turn it too into an Arab state. Needless to say, since the Jews have no intention of committing national suicide, the Palestinians' obsession with their own version of justice promises perpetual conflict. 

By contrast to the bitter fruits of the rigid pursuit of justice, the Jews have demonstrated the blessings of compromise. While ideologically-motivated components aggressively advocated "liberating" and settling all of western Eretz Yisrael in the late 1940s and since 1967, the mainstream--from Ben Gurion's time to that of Sharon and Olmert--was willing to endure the pains of the historic compromise of partition that the 1937 report proposed. For want of a responsible Palestinian partner Ben Gurion made a deal with the king of Jordan; Sharon took a unilateral step in Gaza; and Olmert may have to follow a similar strategy in the West Bank. They all understood that the compromise of partition is not only politically inescapable, but also a precondition for the realization of the essence of the Zionist dream of nation-building so eloquently formulated by the Royal Commission seven decades ago: "they mean to show what the Jewish nation can achieve when restored to the land of its birth."
