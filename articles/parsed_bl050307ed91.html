One of the biggest mistakes of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process of the 1990s concerns the 40-some kilometers of Israeli territory that separate the Gaza Strip from the West Bank. The Oslo agreements stipulate that the two Palestinian territories should be treated as one; the PLO accepted autonomy in Gaza and the West Bank and demanded that these Palestinian territories captured by Israel in the Six-Day War become the Palestinian state. Generally speaking, Israel accepted that such a "split state" would or could come into existence. But nowhere did a binding agreement stipulate that the two territories had to be physically linked--by a dedicated bridge or tunnel or sunken thruway. 

Ideas and suggestions for such a link were plentiful during the '90s. Japan and the European Union even discussed, at various stages, the possibility of funding a land bridge or sunken road. But nothing happened, in part due to legitimate Israeli security concerns lest Palestinian terrorists abuse the transportation artery, but also because the issue was not assigned high enough priority. Today no one talks about such a link any more, and the barrier to Palestinian unity constituted by the 40-some kilometers appears to be growing rapidly in significance.

Indeed, in recent years a broad spectrum of Israeli planners and researchers has responded to strategic events on the ground by rethinking the Gaza-West Bank political link. Some of these events relate directly, and negatively, to the Palestinian state-building project: the collapse of Oslo-based peace talks, the suicide violence of the second intifada, the rise of Hamas to power with its stronghold in Gaza and, consequently, growing skepticism in Israel regarding the feasibility of finding a viable Palestinian partner for a two-state solution. 

Additional relevant strategic events are regional in nature: the growing Iranian threat from the east and the dangers of Iraq fragmenting into militant Sunni and Shi'ite states pose a threat to Jordan and call into question the advisability of Israel withdrawing from the Jordan Valley, which constitutes some 30 percent of West Bank territory. The rise of militant Shi'ite and Sunni Islam portrays Hamas' domination of Gaza in a new and problematic light. 

Hence some of these thinkers call into question the logic of attaching Gaza to the West Bank. Some have suggested enshrining a Fateh-dominated state in the West Bank and isolating Hamas in Gaza. Others wish to turn Gaza into the dominant part of a Palestinian political entity by persuading Egypt to cede to it territory from northeast Sinai even as Israel annexes parts of the West Bank. A related school of thought sees in the Palestinian failure at self-government an opportunity to deliver Gaza back to Egyptian rule or domination and the West Bank to Jordan. 

Israel's removal from Gaza of its settlements and military units in August 2005 already created a new status for the Strip. Unlike the West Bank, Gaza enjoys full territorial contiguity and a land passage to a neighboring Arab country. While most of the world does not accept the Israeli argument that these factors have altered Gaza's status de jure, clearly there is now a difference de facto. 

But permanent separation between Gaza and the West Bank is decidedly not the prevailing operative view among Israeli governing and security circles. It is simply incorrect for Palestinians to argue that Israel is deliberately acting to separate Gaza from the West Bank by radically reducing the capacity of goods and people to move from one to the other. As in so many areas of Palestinian-Israeli interaction, here too the inclination to attribute to Israel nefarious plots to dismember Palestine and prevent peace gives the government in Jerusalem far too much "credit" for Machiavellian thinking. 

Israel has closed passages and transportation routes that link Gaza to Israel and the West Bank because of acts of Palestinian terrorism that have been directed at those passages. The same Palestinians who take pride in such terrorist acts or do nothing to prevent them then turn around and blame Israel for reacting to protect itself. According to UN sources, the Gaza passages were open to a greater extent in late February than previously, despite ongoing Qassam rocket fire from Gaza into Israel that violates the ceasefire. 

The Olmert government and indeed the majority of Israelis still consider a single Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank the preferred solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Granted, Israel's government is weak and seemingly incapable of sustaining a peace process that would create such a state. But the governmental situation in Palestine is far worse. Palestinians today can only blame themselves for the growing chasm that separates Gaza and the West Bank.

Undoubtedly, both Israeli governments and the international community missed many opportunities over the past 13 years since the formation of the PA to build an extra-territorial land bridge that would permanently link Gaza and the West Bank and increase the likelihood of a successful two-state solution. And yet, perhaps the most discouraging take on this issue today is the near certainty that, had the land bridge indeed been up and functioning and Gaza and the West Bank physically linked, under current circumstances Israel would have placed a tank and a platoon of soldiers at each end of the road and severed it.- Published 5/3/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org
