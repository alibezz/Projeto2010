Palestinian society has reached a new crossroads--one of many encountered in recent generations. Indeed, the chronicles of Palestinian society comprise many such crossroads and few periods of routine. The Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip have never enjoyed a single day of real independence; for years they have been struggling against a steady stream of rulers and enemies. 

In the course of the past two centuries, the Palestinians have been ruled by four or five foreign regimes: they were exploited by the Ottoman Empire and subjugated by the British Mandate. The West Bankers suffered deliberate discrimination under the Hashemites, while the Gazans were under tough Egyptian rule. Then, over the past four decades, Israeli occupation inflicted deep wounds on one of the most "ruled" peoples of the modern era.

By now it is clear that the Oslo agreements, too, did not generate any practical or cognizant change on the road to Palestinian independence. Even the creation of the Palestinian Authority, the realization of a long-held dream for seven million Palestinians worldwide, emerged at a certain point as something distant and foreign. Hence the Palestinian public punished Palestine Liberation Organization/Fateh by removing it from power, and installed in its stead a radical and fundamentalist religious body, the Hamas movement, to lead it in the years ahead.

Yet the choice of Hamas rule by the Palestinian public does reflect a degree of continuity in terms of political behavior. Prior to the emergence of the PA in the mid-1990s, the Palestinian public had focused its struggle on external enemies and foreign rulers. After 1967, Palestinian society sharply opposed Israeli military government and sought to establish a degree of autonomy by choosing an authentic leadership hostile to Israel. For example, in the late 1960s Israel wanted Muhammad Ali Jabri from Hebron to lead, while the public selected the "Palestinian National Front", which was supported mainly by the Syrian Baath party. In the early 1980s, Israel tried to impose the "Village Leagues" on the territories, but the local population responded by bringing the PLO into Nablus, Hebron and Gaza. Now, in the 2006 elections, the Palestinian public produced a more extreme government than its predecessor even without outside involvement. This time the enemy ruler was the PA itself.

PLO/Fateh was not removed from rule of the PA merely because it was perceived as corrupt or due to unacceptable societal behavior. In the eyes of most of the Palestinian public, the outgoing PA government of Arafat and Abu Mazen was too moderate in its approach to Israel and the West. Accordingly, in keeping with the historical pattern, the public replaced them with a more militant and extremist leadership.

Now, after a grace period of several months, the public is beginning to perceive the nature of the impending socio-economic disaster. The Palestinians understand that Hamas will be unable to deliver on its promise of improved quality of life without changing direction politically--meaning abandoning its ideological approach. Hence some Palestinians are already preparing for another change.

Where is Palestinian society headed? It appears once again to have reached a crossroads--a particularly problematic one. There is no political alternative to Hamas; it is unlikely that Fateh and the other moderate movements will be returned to power in new democratic elections. The Palestinian public has never become more moderate--only more extreme. Hence there appear to be three possible scenarios for the near future:

First, a coup d'etat led by the Fateh leaders who command some 50,000 armed men from the various security forces. Jibril Rajoub, the jailed Marwan Barghouti and Muhammad Dahlan have watched helplessly as power slipped through their fingers after years of struggle and personal sacrifice. They are aware of the support they are likely to get from an economically battered public that would draw new hope from a coup. To be sure, Hamas activists would oppose such a move, but Fateh, backed by Israel and the West, would win the day. Israel and the West, incidentally, appreciate that it is easier to alter the PLO's behavior than to replace Hamas' ideology.

A second possibility is that the economic pressure would simply "not wait" for political developments to catch up and the Palestinian street would speak by generating total anarchy, "every man to himself". Under these circumstances street fighting, looting and pillaging could become the order of the day and fitna--the civil war that Palestinians are so concerned about--would rage.

In yet a third possible scenario, the territory of the West Bank and Gaza is divided among "governors", modern Diadochi, who hasten to grab power in those areas where they have strong societal roots. This would create a de facto cantonization, with one ruler, say, for the Mount Hebron region and another declaring his rule in Samaria, one ruler for the northern Gaza Strip and another for the south. Each warlord would maintain military, economic and social independence in his canton.

Such a development would give the term "roadmap" a more ironic connotation.- Published 15/5/2006 &copy;bitterlemons.org
