Is the democratically-elected Palestinian president relevant? The instinctive response is to recoil from a question that is so indicative of the arrogance and paternalism that has ill-served Israeli policy and interests over the years. Abu Mazen (President Mahmoud Abbas), should he be in need of it, can draw comfort from joining a long list of regional leaders whose vitality has out-lived Israeli determinations of their having passed from relevancy. Perhaps one can put the unfortunate application of this term to President Abbas down to the inexperience and steep learning curve that Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni is currently immersed in. It would certainly not be unreasonable to turn the question on its head and ponder the relevance of most Israeli civilian-political leaders given the conspicuous, dominant (and largely unhelpful) role assumed by the military-security establishment.

And yet, the question is out there, so why not address it head-on. The critical role that Mahmoud Abbas played historically in bringing the Palestinian national movement to a position of mutual recognition and a two-state solution is well-documented. His ideological imprimatur can be found in the PNC Algiers Declaration and the dialogue with the US that followed, and in the Madrid and Oslo frameworks. He has been a framer and shaper, not a follower, in defining moments. It is only fair to remember that his election mandate as PA president was based on 62.3 percent of the vote, and that even in recent post-PLC polls he remains the most popular leader among Palestinians. In his dual role as PLO chair and PA president, Abu Mazen is the repository and source of authority of Oslo and all previously signed agreements.

From an Israeli perspective, one cannot make a credible international demand for the adherence to these agreements and at the same time deny the relevance of their standard-bearer. Now that Israel's leaders have rediscovered Oslo (ostensibly to use against Hamas) they might take the time to read it.

One could add to this that, given the power dynamics, the practical relevance of any Palestinian leader will always be in large measure a function of Israeli policy and willingness to work with that leader. With this one could close the case, but given the current chorus of voices insisting that Abbas has not been--and post-PLC elections cannot be--relevant, it is worth outlining four areas in which his influence has the potential to be decisive.

The first area will undoubtedly be treated with the most skepticism, namely, Abbas as a leader who can impact the day-to-day running of the PA territories. The powers vested in the office of the PA president are not insignificant. For that office to run an entire shadow government is neither realistic nor desirable, yet important functions of security and channeling of financial assistance can be assumed and this should not be ruled out. As the UNSCO Envoy Alvaro de Soto reported to the UN Security Council last week, "The Palestinian Authority is not something that can be turned on and off like a light switch."  Maintenance of PA structures and capacities are an international and Israeli--as well as Palestinian Authority--interest, and the Abbas presidency could play a crucial role in preserving them under current circumstances.

Second, Abbas is the leader of Fateh and represents ideological opposition to Hamas within the Palestinian body politic. Anyone interested in Palestinian alternatives, as opposed to further embellishment of the self-fulfilling "no partner" motif or simply collapsing the PA and leaving a vacuum, has to take this seriously. The internal Palestinian political relevance of the Fateh leader in the current context and therefore, by extension, to the broader picture, should not be underestimated. The vitality of the leader of Fateh is about more than the future of the peace process. It is about the future of Palestinian democracy.

Third, Abu Mazen is an accepted Palestinian interlocutor vis-a-vis Israel, the US and the international community. Beyond the inherent desirability of dialogue, there are a range of practical and funding issues that will require an address and a predictability of outcome on the other side. The "fig leaf" role is sometimes very much needed--just ask Shimon Peres. Taking this a step further, if Israel and the Quartet were belatedly to wake up to the need for a political horizon and a political negotiated process, then Abu Mazen would become indispensable and would himself be greatly empowered by such a process. Any outcome could be put to a referendum, which in turn could present the most effective political challenge to Hamas.

Finally, the Abbas presidency could be a pivotal, constructive factor in testing the Hamas capacity for moderation. The theory of political participation and governance responsibility being a factor for greater moderation now needs to be put to practical and realistic tests. In this respect, the Abbas presidency could be used as a positive channel to a Hamas government in working to facilitate a tolerable outcome rather than as part of a sledgehammer policy against Hamas that is likely to boomerang.

For all the complaints, many justified, regarding the delivery record of the Palestinian president, more than enough blame for the current situation is shared by Israel and the Quartet. The Palestinian leader, just like the Israeli leader, can be part of the problem or part of the solution. But the first step in realizing a solution demands an end to the mindset whereby one side confers relevance or otherwise on the elected leaders of the other side.- Published 6/3/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org
