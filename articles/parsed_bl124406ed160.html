Sometime soon, Ehud Olmert will complete the formation of his government and receive a vote of confidence from the Knesset. The government's guidelines will almost certainly call for an attempt to negotiate with the Palestinians if a viable partner can be found. Failing successful negotiations, the guidelines will call, explicitly or implicitly, for Israel to begin invoking unilateral measures. Shortly thereafter Olmert will travel to Washington to seek White House blessing for his convergence plan.

The call for negotiations will be included in the guidelines in order to satisfy the ideological requirements of the left wing of the coalition: Labor, and Kadima figures like Shimon Peres. The call for unilateral measures may be left implicit in order to satisfy the needs of the right wing of the coalition: Shas and/or Yisrael Beiteinu. What concerns us here is the first part of this equation, chronologically as well as logically: the possibility of finding a Palestinian negotiating partner. 

Is this a realistic proposition, or merely a sop to the Israeli left and international opinion--a ritual required to justify further unilateral measures? Should President George W. Bush, or the Quartet, for example, insist that Olmert enter a serious round of negotiations as a condition for eventually--if they fail--placing a stamp of approval on Olmert's disengagement scheme? On April 23 Olmert stated that he believed the international community now understood there was no Palestinian partner. Presumably he was referring to both Hamas and Palestinian Authority President and PLO head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen).

As matters currently stand, rejection of Hamas' candidacy as a negotiating partner is a "no-brainer". Hamas itself refuses to negotiate. And it continues to reject the conditions presented by Israel and the international community for legitimizing its rule and initiating diplomatic contact. Its enthusiastic approval for last week's suicide bombing in Tel Aviv and its appointment of a notorious terrorist to a senior police position were stark reminders that the diverse and murky "compromise" formulae its spokesmen have put forth in recent weeks cannot conceal its essential nature as a terrorist organization.

So there is little likelihood that in the coming months anyone will suggest to Olmert that he negotiate with Hamas.

That leaves Mahmoud Abbas. In recent weeks, he has maneuvered politically on two fronts, both domestically and internationally. On the one hand, he acquiesced in Hamas' government guidelines despite earlier threats and protestations to the contrary. He has also tried to raise funds, primarily in the Arab world, that could well end up in the Hamas treasury. 

But on the other, Abbas presents himself as an alternative to Hamas in terms of both protocol and ideology. He reminds Israel that as head of the PLO he remains Israel's negotiating partner, a position acknowledged by Hamas. He does nothing to dispel the notion that he and his entourage should be considered a kind of shadow Palestinian government, waiting in the wings for Hamas to admit failure, soften its ideology and yield to Fateh or bring it into the PA government. He signaled the sincerity of his intentions by condemning the Tel Aviv suicide bombing in unequivocal and even provocative language.

Is Abu Mazen a viable negotiating partner for the Olmert government? I doubt it, though Olmert may have to at least go through the motions of discussing the issues with him before the Israeli government opts for more unilateralism. The reasons for Abu Mazen's lack of viability as a partner involve both form and substance.

With regard to form, it is difficult to argue convincingly that Abu Mazen has a valid mandate for negotiating with Israelis, even though as head of the PLO he is still technically our partner. For one, he is obligated by his March 2005 agreement with Hamas to integrate it into the PLO; once that happens, the PLO becomes a very different organization. Meanwhile its main component, Fateh, is still run by veteran "bolsheviks" who reject internal change and no longer even represent the Fateh rank and file, while Fateh militants are stepping up terrorist activities despite Abu Mazen's appeals. 

Thus there is no assurance that, were Abu Mazen to succeed in striking a deal with Israel, either Fateh or the PA government under Hamas would accept it in a convincing way. Indeed, the growing Fateh-Hamas rift, anarchy in Gaza and the West Bank and the danger of "Somalization" of Palestinian life call into question the wisdom of negotiating at present with anyone in Palestine.

As for substance, this is the same Abu Mazen who continues to adhere to positions on the "existential" issues--the right of return, the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif--that signaled to Israelis back in 2000-2001 that we do not have a partner for an end-of-conflict agreement; the same Abu Mazen who pledged to Hamas in March of last year that the right of return would include restoration of all Palestinian lands as well as homes from the pre-1948 period--a sure formula, in Israeli eyes, for the elimination of Israel as a Jewish state. Under these circumstances, to negotiate with him and fail would be worse for the long-term chances for peace than not to negotiate at all and to proceed unilaterally in ways that do not contradict the map of an eventual two-state solution.

There may be some aspects of another West Bank withdrawal that can and should be coordinated with Abu Mazen. But only if he is prepared to work with Israel and the international community in a conflict management rather than conflict resolution mode--and if he is capable of delivering on Palestinian commitments "on the ground" in the West Bank. So far, even before Hamas was elected on January 25 of this year, he has failed conspicuously in this regard as well.- Published 24/4/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org
