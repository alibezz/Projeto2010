President Mahmoud Abbas represents the peace camp in Palestine. This camp believes in a negotiated approach to finding a solution with Israel that can secure an end to the occupation that started in 1967 and that will allow for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and a resolution to the refugee problem in accordance with UN General Assembly Resolution 194. 

After the death of the late President Yasser Arafat--who was accused of taking a hard line at the Camp David summit in 2000 and of encouraging violence in his last years--Abbas was elected on the basis of this well-understood position and by a vast majority in the Palestinian occupied territory. In other words, the Palestinian public voted for the peace camp.

But "luck" was not on Abu Mazen's side. He was elected at a time when the political reality in both Israel and the US was not conducive to peacemaking. Indeed, the lackluster Israeli and American response to Abu Mazen's election victory convinced the Palestinian public that the peaceful approach had no future. 

That, combined with the relentless economic deterioration in the occupied territories that was a direct result of draconian Israeli restrictions on the movement of goods and people, led to a trend of radicalization in public opinion, culminating in the victory of Hamas in the 2006 parliamentary elections. Consequently, Palestinians are now questioning the future of the peace camp and thus the very Palestinian cause. The failure of the peaceful approach to reach a two-state solution will only lead to a never-ending cycle of violence. 

Hamas' victory in the parliamentary elections and its subsequent military victory over Fateh in Gaza shocked the international community. Thus questions are now being asked about how to rescue the situation and stop the deterioration. The most commonly asked question in this respect is how to support Abu Mazen and who should lead this charge. 

Paradoxically, it is the very same parties who did so much to undermine Abbas that are now scrambling to support him, namely the international community, particularly the US, and Israel. But to do so is to understand that it was Israeli policies that were directly responsible for weakening Abu Mazen in the first place, particularly in that crucial year after Arafat's death and Hamas' victory in parliamentary elections.

Israel weakened Abbas intentionally. Abbas' firm stand in favor of negotiations posed an unanswerable challenge to an Israeli polity that has no intention of loosening its grip on its illegal settlements in the West Bank and thus no intention of ending its belligerent occupation of the Palestinian people and their land. This continues today. The Palestinian public is not fooled by Israeli statements in support of Abbas as long as Israeli actions on the ground do exactly the opposite and continue to slice up Palestinian land, isolating Palestinians into ghettos that endure economic hardships and threaten humanitarian disaster.

There are only two factors that can now ensure Abbas' political survival. One is internal and one external. Internally, Abbas needs to end the harm done by certain elements within his Fateh faction, particularly the armed elements, who have acted only in narrow power interests rather than in the interests of the Palestinian people as a whole.

Externally, Abbas needs a serious peace process of the kind that immediately stops the consolidation of the occupation and tangibly can be seen to lead to the achievement of the legitimate and just aspirations of the Palestinian people of freedom, independence and statehood. Only this way will the public's confidence in the peace camp be restored .- Published 16/7/2007 &copy; bitterlemons.org
