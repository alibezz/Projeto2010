As an Israeli looking at Palestinian society, I must be guided by certain basic facts. One is that there is no possibility of a peace agreement between our two peoples as long as Gaza and the West Bank are two separate and hostile entities, ruled by different governments with no meaningful dialogue between them. I also believe that one can say as a fact that a majority of Palestinians do want to see a peace agreement between our two peoples and would welcome a two-state formula based on a just solution of the core issues, and that this majority includes many of those who voted for Hamas in the last elections. They voted for Hamas for reasons we know very well, reasons that do not necessarily include strict adherence to the fundamentalist religious ideology expressed in the Hamas charter. I am sure that not all Palestinians who voted for Hamas want to see Islamic Sharia law regulating their lives.

There is, of course, a hard core of Hamas activists who will never accept Israel living side-by-side in peace with a sovereign Palestinian state. In mosques, schools and in their media they have preached jihad against the Jews. The Hamas charter states, "There is no solution for the Palestinian problem other than jihad. All the initiatives and international conferences are a waste of time and a futile game." Yet the Hamas leaders have declared that if the Palestinian Authority under President Mahmoud Abbas were to succeed in reaching an agreement with Israel, they would agree that it be brought to a referendum of the Palestinian people and would abide by the decision of the majority. That declaration gives hope that Hamas' opposition to any peace agreement between Palestine and Israel can be overcome, provided the two opposing forces--the largely secular Fateh and the fundamentalist-dominated Hamas--can be reconciled.

The difficulties lying in the way of such reconciliation are plain to see. Any attempt to achieve it would encounter strong opposition from the Fateh rank and file who have neither forgotten nor forgiven the brutal manner in which Hamas ousted Fateh from Gaza. Nevertheless, a renewed understanding between Fateh and Hamas is an essential prerequisite for the peace process to possibly succeed.

Israel would oppose a return to the unity government and has threatened to break off peace negotiations if that happens. The position of the government of Israel is clear: Hamas is a terrorist organization; it does not recognize the right of Israel to exist; it does not accept previous agreements between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. Hamas, therefore, is an enemy and must be dealt with as such. 

The position, however, of many Israelis, especially those in the peace camp, is much more ambivalent. The fundamentalist fanaticism of the hard core is repugnant in their eyes, yet they understand that no magic wand exists that can make the Hamas ultras disappear, nor can it be done by a massive military operation; they realize that Hamas is a factor that must be taken into account. 

The Israeli peace camp believes that the majority of Hamas supporters are not fanatic, that they would welcome a peace agreement and that Israel should reach out to them. The likes of Khaled Meshaal are beyond the pale, but surely not all Hamas officials share his extremist views. The peace camp believes, as I do, that if only progress can be made in the Annapolis process then more and more Hamas voters will "see the light" and support the efforts of President Abbas to bring peace to their land.

The key, therefore, to the present double impasse--Fateh-Hamas, Israel-Hamas--lies in progress in the negotiations. Here we still have a long way to go. The Arab governments must be much more forthcoming in their support. They must address the problem of Hamas opposition to the peace negotiations. US President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice must live up to their promises. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, having weathered successfully the Winograd report, must now demonstrate that he is serious about peace by 2009 and that means changing facts on the ground--removing roadblocks, dismantling outposts, freezing construction in settlements--as well as making progress in the final status negotiations with Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala).

If the Annapolis process can produce a political horizon for the Palestinian people and if hope for a better future can be attained, then, possibly, Fateh and the pragmatist parties will do much better in the next Palestinian elections and the hardliners will be weakened, enabling Fateh to restore its authority in Gaza.

Unfortunately, however, there exists an alternative scenario. Hamas resumes suicide attacks and escalates its Qassam rocket offensive, leading to a massive riposte by the IDF and an end to the negotiations. Both Israelis and Palestinians will then be the losers. 

Which is it to be? Unfortunately, it can go either way. For once, I must admit, I am not so optimistic.- Published 11/2/2008 &copy; bitterlemons.org
