There is a Hamas government in place in Palestine, while in Israel it is clear that Ehud Olmert will form a government dedicated in one form or another to a platform of additional territorial withdrawals. The fog of politics is starting to clear, and accordingly the United States and European Union should begin to formulate a strategy for dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the months ahead. Many of the thoughts laid out below are appropriate for Israeli thinking about Hamas as well. Indeed, the greater the degree of coordination between Israel and the international community regarding Hamas, the better for all concerned, including moderate Palestinians.

This can only be the beginning of formulating a strategy, because the new reality is still evolving. An electoral takeover by the Muslim Brotherhood (of which Hamas is a branch) in an Arab country remains such an unprecedented event that patience and caution are the appropriate watchwords. This is particularly so when the Arab country in question is Palestine, not a sovereign state but rather an entity still deeply enmeshed in conflict with Israel. So point one of a proposed four-point strategy for the US and the EU is: consider this a learning process, and proceed with caution.

Point two is to fine-tune the aid effort to the greatest extent possible so as to ensure, on the one hand that Palestinians don't starve or suffer undue hardship, while on the other avoiding any compromise in the conditions placed on political contacts with Hamas. For the international community this is a matter of realpolitik as well as credibility. The decisions taken last week by the US and the EU regarding restrictions on aid point in the right direction: cautious realpolitik. On the other hand, hocus pocus formulae for considering, for example, that Hamas has recognized Israel (despite its insistence to the contrary) because it participated in elections in the Palestinian Authority, which was created by Israel and the PLO, would ill serve the EU's credibility. 

Israel, too, is talking about funneling the taxes it collects on behalf of the PA to Palestinian non-governmental institutions. This approach is based on the recognition that, on the one hand, severe economic hardship in Palestine will strengthen rather than weaken Hamas, while on the other, political isolation, tough demands on Hamas to renounce violence and recognize Israel, and denial of development funds might continue to pressure the Palestinian Islamists to a point of either moderating their policies or losing power. The stammering "concessions" heard in recent days from Hamas leaders regarding a two-state solution and peaceful coexistence with neighbors seem to indicate that the current carrot-and-stick policy is worth maintaining.

Third, the international community needs a new strategic framework for dealing with the conflict at the political level. The roadmap was stillborn three years ago; it is time to bury it before the odor of decay becomes embarrassing for all concerned. Israel is showing the way with its disengagement/convergence program. But disengagement, while strategically important for Israel--it helps maintain the substance of a Jewish, democratic state--is of largely tactical significance for the conflict as a whole, because it offers no political solution. 

The US and the EU should embrace additional Israeli withdrawals as a way of reducing the ills of occupation, on condition that they leave open the window of a negotiated two state solution in the future, and that withdrawals include the outposts as well as large parts of Arab Jerusalem. They should also recognize that convergence, under the best of circumstances, will take far longer than the four years and eight months that Olmert hopes his government will survive. In other words, there is no "quick fix" to this conflict, roadmap style, with phases lasting eight or 18 months. And the international community should avoid being tempted into far-reaching condominium-type solutions that could end up pitting an international force in Palestine against both militant Palestinians and frustrated Israelis.

Fourth and last, and without prejudice to the political conditions for opening up official contacts with Hamas, the international community can begin to think about facilitating informal contacts between private Israeli citizens and spokespersons for Hamas. Eventually the two sides will have to talk to one another; meanwhile they should get to know each other better. Private European research institutions have carried out this sort of task very effectively in the past; the EU can find quiet ways to encourage this approach. The Olmert government should be interested in hearing the impressions of Israelis who have met with Hamas representatives in a totally non-committal framework, even if they merely confirm the negative image generated thus far.- Published 10/4/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org
