The first decade of the twenty-first century was characterized by crisis in both Israeli-Palestinian communication and progress toward an Israeli-Palestinian agreement.

A few days ago, I was interviewed by an American university student. He wanted to know the reasons for the failure of the Oslo declaration of principles. I surprised the young man by asserting that the Oslo DOP had not failed. Indeed, today virtually no one on either side calls into question the agreement's basic assumption: a political solution based on the existence of two nation-states, Jewish-Israeli and Arab-Palestinian, side by side.

Rather, it was the process that failed: the steps that were laid out for reaching this solution. Since 2000, when the Camp David talks between PM Ehud Barak and President Yasser Arafat collapsed, followed by the outbreak of the second intifada in late September, we have been stuck in the mud. Thus the process that commenced in 1994 undoubtedly failed. This has led us into repeated attempts to renew negotiations and move toward an agreed solution, along with a variety of outbreaks of politically-motivated violence.

When the young American asked me what, then, had caused the failure of the Oslo process, I had no easy reply. I explained that I couldn't decide among three possible reasons and that conceivably two or all three of them were relevant.

The first explanation links the failure to the details of the Oslo agreement itself. The method established for implementing the agreement contained a self-destruct mechanism that rendered crisis and implosion inevitable. The negotiators and drafters of Oslo were too optimistic. They believed that their shared euphoria over the breakthrough would remove the many obstacles ahead. They adopted a bottom-up approach whereby a gradual process of confidence-building would precede negotiations on the core issues and soften up the two sides so they would enter final-status negotiations in a flexible mode. Sadly, the result was the complete reverse: each side sought to gain the advantage and create facts on the ground that would improve its chances for a better deal in the final phase.

The second reason lays the blame on the implementation, policies and behavior of the two sides. We witnessed behavior that contradicted the central concept of the agreement: building mutual confidence. We still recall the optimistic images of Palestinians in the territories decorating the rifle barrels of IDF soldiers with flowers--but very quickly we returned to "business as usual". On the Palestinian side, we read and heard the incitement voiced by Arafat and others that so sorely contradicted the spirit of the agreement and the ideal of coexistence; we witnessed the minor infractions but also the frustrating terrorist attacks. And on the Israeli side, settlement spread continued as if nothing had happened. What was impossible to understand and negated all expectations was the lack of response by the Rabin government to the massacre perpetrated at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron by Baruch Goldstein. And finally, in November 1995 came the Rabin assassination, followed by the rise of a Likud government.

The third reason concerns me the most. This is the possibility that, from the very beginning, there was no real Palestinian Arab readiness to acquiesce in Israel's existence and coexist with it. At the heart of this assumption lies a Palestinian misunderstanding and refusal to acknowledge the historical-ideological underpinnings of the Zionist movement and the Jews' attachment to their ancient homeland. Without Palestinian flexibility and compromise regarding this core issue there is no prospect of an agreement.

This brings me to the past decade, wherein we can point to three important developments.

On the Palestinian side Yasser Arafat, the spiritual father of the Palestinian national movement, departed the scene. Without a charismatic and dominant leader, it is hard to envision the Palestinians making the hard political decisions required for progress. This is particularly the case in view of the schism between the radical Hamas leadership controlling the Gaza Strip and the moderate PLO leadership in the West Bank.

Meanwhile, Israeli public opinion has moved strongly toward the nationalist right. The Israeli left has almost disappeared. Over the years, Jewish settlement in the West Bank has created a reality that no conceivable Israeli government may be able to eliminate.

These two developments are confronted by a growing international involvement that seeks to present the outline of a final-status arrangement. Ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has also become a vital interest of the Arab world. This is the most optimistic news we could confront as we move from one decade to the next.- Published 4/1/2010 &copy; bitterlemons.org
