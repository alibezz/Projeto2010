It is really quite striking to take in hand a document about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict written 70 years ago--in this case, a summary of a summary chapter of the Peel Commission ("Palestine Royal Commission") Report of July 1937--and find so much of immediate relevance.

There is no military solution, the report states: "repression will not solve the problem." Nor can the "well-being and development" of the population be expanded in view of the security burden of managing the conflict: just ask Israeli tax-payers and Palestinians in Gaza. Yet the solution also does not rest in mere economic development: "the conciliatory effect on the Palestinian Arabs of the material prosperity which Jewish immigration would bring in Palestine as a whole" was found by the report to be not justified. After 40 years of occupation, many Israelis and international actors still do not understand that economic carrots (and sticks) will not significantly change Palestinian attitudes.

There is more: "the hardships and anxieties of the Jews in Europe are not likely to grow less", states the Peel report, anticipating the Holocaust with characteristic understatement. And "there is no [single]. . . system which could ensure justice both to the Arabs and to the Jews"--a reminder to those who then as now clamor for the chimera of  a "one-state solution".

Finally, "while neither race can fairly rule all Palestine, each race might justly rule part of it". Here is the birth of the still elusive two-state solution. Seventy years and several attempts later, we are still not there. It took the Palestinian national movement another 50 years and several wars after Peel to finally embrace the idea officially; many Israelis continue to harbor the suspicion that ongoing Palestinian demands like the right of return contradict the spirit if not the letter of a two-state solution. At the same time, a dedicated and fanatic messianic minority in Israel is also determined to prevent such a solution, as is Hamas, which represents roughly half the Palestinian population.

Some 70 years after Peel, we have just hosted yet another attempt by outside forces to catalyze the process of partitioning Mandatory Palestine into two states. Indeed, US President George W. Bush is the first American leader to officially endorse the two-state solution in the post-1967 era. Still, Bush's half-hearted engagement is likely to be as futile as were the British efforts of mandatory times.

Yet, "partition offers a chance of ultimate peace. No other plan does." This closing statement is as resoundingly true today as it was in 1937. The difference is that in the course of the past 70 years the alternatives, the "other plans", have indeed been tried and found wanting: war, Jordanian and Egyptian rule, Israeli rule, autonomy, unilateralism, Palestinian intifada. Palestinian and other Arab mistakes have, over these years, radically altered the ratio of land allotted to Jews and Arabs to the extent that today the Palestinian national movement is negotiating over approximately the same small percentage of the overall territory of Mandatory Palestine that the Jews were offered by Peel--and accepted. 

With every new round of war and negotiations since then the Palestinian leadership has confronted the demand to negotiate a Palestinian state in a reduced portion of the whole--reduced by its own making. Palestinian frustration and anger is thus fully understandable. But Palestinian failure to make good on a Palestinian national homeland is unforgivable.
