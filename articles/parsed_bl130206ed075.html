Hamas' victory in the democratic elections held in the Palestinian Authority is bad news for the Palestinians and bad news for Israel. From the Palestinian standpoint, an extremist religious organization is liable to turn the daily lives of the non-religious public into a living hell. From Israel's standpoint this is an organization that is not prepared to recognize it, negotiate with it or make peace with it. Many of us warned that if Israel weakens the Palestinian Authority and its infrastructure and expresses contempt for its leader--we would end up with Hamas. Nor can there be any doubt that the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza strengthened Hamas. 

Now that it has happened, what do we do? How do we take advantage of the more positive aspects of this event?

Hamas has displayed greater self control than Fateh. This is an actor capable of making decisions and implementing them. On the other hand Abu Mazen (President Mahmoud Abbas), who found himself in a near impossible situation prior to the elections, has become indispensable: he is the only leader acceptable to Fateh; Hamas doesn't want him to resign because of his international stature; Israel considers him a partner; and so does the world. The "chick without feathers", as Ariel Sharon called him, is being courted by everyone; right now he can dictate conditions for agreeing to remain in office. Meanwhile, Fateh has received a ringing slap in the face that should jolt it out of its current situation and oblige the Palestinian secular-pragmatic camp to regroup and get back on its feet.

Israel's unilateral withdrawal option appears, for the time being, more distant than ever. Such a withdrawal is precisely what Hamas wants--Israel disengages from territories in the West Bank against the backdrop of the Hamas victory and delivers up these lands to Hamas rule without the Islamist movement making the slightest concession and without it recognizing Israel. Only in the absence of a negotiated end-of-conflict agreement does this become the fallback option for anyone who believes that it is imperative--from the standpoint of Israel's national interest--to end the occupation and partition the land in the course of the next Knesset term.

Is Hamas, then, likely to become a partner? Theoretically, and perhaps not only theoretically, the answer is yes. Even if it is hard to imagine right now, it is Israel's obligation to present Hamas with conditions and demand that it fulfill them in order to open peace negotiations. The act of talking to Hamas should not, in my view, be dependent on conditions, but negotiations must be conditioned on Hamas recognizing Israel and abandoning terrorism. If it meets these conditions there is no reason not to try and reach agreement with its representatives.

Hamas may not wish to undertake such negotiations itself, but may not prevent others from doing so either. It may be convenient for Hamas to set up a political screen between itself and Israel and the world (for example, by establishing a technocrat government with its support but without its participation). Under these circumstances, Israel could continue to hold peace negotiations (which ended at Taba in January 2001) with the PLO or with a negotiating team appointed by PA President Abu Mazen, on condition that Hamas agree from the start that the product of the negotiations be brought to a Palestinian referendum, and that it would accept the outcome.

The PLO, after all, is the only partner Israel has negotiated with since the Oslo track began. I remember well the last crisis prior to the signing of the September 13, 1993 Declaration of Principles, when it was still described as an agreement between Israel and the Palestinian delegation to Washington and Yasser Arafat threatened to go back to Tunis unless the header was changed to an agreement with the PLO. Alternatively, Abu Mazen might prefer to reestablish the presidential negotiating committee and hold talks with us as both president of the PA and chairman of the PLO. We can agree to any option that will, at the end of the process, be given authoritative ratification.

It is too early to make a definitive determination. As long as a coalition among the rational forces in the region is possible, we have to develop options and examine all the practical possibilities.- Published 13/2/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org
