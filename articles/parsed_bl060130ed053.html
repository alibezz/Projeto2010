No one imagined that Legislative Council elections would be transformed from a way to defuse a crisis to the creation of a new one. The general expectation from these elections was to expand participation in the Palestinian political system and rectify the internal Palestinian situation to guarantee a more unified and harmonious performance. The impact of this, it was thought, would be reflected not only on the internal situation but also in relations with external parties, especially as they related to any political settlement with Israel. 

For this to happen, it was necessary that elections bring Hamas into the political system as an effective though not rejectionist opposition in parliament. Meanwhile, Fateh and its affiliates from the Third Way would win the majority of seats, giving them continued control over the PA and over political negotiations. 

But, to everyone's surprise, Hamas won an overwhelming majority of seats, Fateh retreated to a distant second and the Third Way was literally crushed. The total number of seats won by other blocs was not enough to either further or retard any political solution. 

Victory is always a desired end. However, if it exceeds a certain limit, it creates a kind of flood that creates unexpected or undesired burdens even for the victors themselves. Since the events of 9/11, Hamas has been widely targeted by Israel and the West. Following its designation by the West as a terrorist organization, and the subsequent restrictions imposed to dry up its' financial resources, and once its political and field leaders were assassinated by Israel, Hamas began to feel the pressure. 

Thus, Hamas began to take steps to preserve itself. With its popularity on the rise because Palestinian society was calling for internal reform and a rectification of a political process that has brought nothing but destruction, a wall and isolated cantons, Hamas grabbed the opportunity to imbue itself with electoral legitimacy and decided to guardedly enter the Palestinian political system through the doors of the Legislative Council.

This was not an easy decision for the movement's leadership. It meant changing its former rejectionist position vis-a-vis participating in the 1996 elections and reforming its hard core through a new logic that bridged the gap between its adherence to the declared positions of the movement and its decision to enter a Palestinian political system that was born from the Oslo Accords. 

The movement's leadership sought to adopt a tactic of long-term gradual change--a change that would protect its existence and at the same time not compromise its principles. It planned a transitional crossing into the Palestinian political system, a stage where the movement would be in a position somewhere in-between, that is, one foot inside the political system and the other outside until, in time, the positions merged. Therefore, in its electoral discourse, Hamas tried to differentiate between entering the PLC and joining the Palestinian Authority by considering the PLC an institution "independent" of the PA. 

Hamas' goal was to translate its strength on the Palestinian street into electoral strength that would transform it into a central and powerful opposition inside the PLC. By achieving this, the movement would have gained the ability to change its own status quo without having to change its positions. A place in the opposition in the PLC would have provided Hamas with a suitable podium to promote its slogans and manifesto without having to bear the burden of adhering to these positions. At the same time, Hamas could have taken advantage of its presence in the council for the next four years to facilitate its transformation into a political movement operating fully within the political system. 

In short, Hamas understood that it had to alter its positions and it was willing to do so. However, it needed time and a smooth transitional phase to accomplish this successfully. It was not in its interest, nor indeed did it predict, that this change came about so quickly and so completely.

The election results surprised Hamas as much as they surprised everyone else inside and abroad. Hamas went straight from being completely outside the political system to being at the helm of this system without having benefited from a transitional stage to rehabilitate itself. Instead of the elections aiding Hamas, they've put the movement immediately to the test. Now, as it is facing internal and external pressures, it will be forced to distance itself from the generalities it would have fallen back on if it had been put in the comfortable position of parliamentary opposition. Now, Hamas must give detailed and clear answers to a number of core issues, including recognizing Israel and negotiating with it on the one hand and continuing the armed resistance on the other. 

All the various internal and external pressures on Hamas will not, however, lead to an immediate and fundamental change in its basic positions and platform. Besides the fact that the movement has principles it cannot surrender all at once, as a political movement it also has supporters who voted for its manifesto based on reform and change.

Hence, Hamas, due to its stunning victory, is now under contradictory and conflicting pressures. From one side there are external Israeli, American and European threats not to recognize any Hamas-led government and to halt aid to the PA. This is in tandem with pressures from Fateh, which is seeking to avenge its electoral loss by refusing to lend a hand to Hamas to overcome the crisis. In addition, Hamas is facing the pressures of its own declared positions, its electoral manifesto, and those who voted for the movement and expect it now to translate its positions and statements into action. 

What are the available options to confront this crisis everyone has found themselves in? One option is for the international community to twist Hamas' arm by not recognizing the Palestinian government and cutting off international assistance regardless of the fact that this would be contradictory to accepting the outcome of a democratic process. Opting for this course could put Hamas in an awkward position and adversely impact it. It would also lead to the inevitable collapse of the PA in three months. Is this a desired outcome internationally, regionally or even for Israel? 

The second option is to try and bring all "oppositionists" down from their high horses to accept the political harmony Hamas is seeking. In other words, the option is for Fateh to accept joining a coalition government or for Fateh and the international community to support an apolitical government comprised of technocrats. 

At the Palestinian level what we need now is for our higher interests to overcome any factional interests. Internationally, meanwhile, we need to see a rational and pragmatic response. All parties, in other words, must act with the highest possible level of responsibility and help Hamas deal, with wisdom and vision, with the challenges of the reality imposed on it by the elections. If we do not, it could lead to an explosion the consequences of which will be merciless. I do not believe this is an outcome anyone desires.- Published 30/1/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org
