Fifteen years have passed since the signing of the Oslo accords. In terms of progress and setbacks, the process of peace has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs. As a result, Oslo is frequently overlooked as an historical breakthrough for peacemaking and as the ultimate path to Palestinian-Israeli peace. 

Historically, Oslo put an end to the right wing vision of a greater Israel. Without Oslo, the settlement policy would have continued as well as the gradual annexation of the territories to Israel, making us a bi-national state and creating a former-Yugoslavia situation. 

Oslo also forced the Palestinians to relinquish their desire for a greater Palestine. Oslo provided the foundation for peacemaking and established a time-line with respect to sharing the land between two people and two states. 

The Oslo actors hoped that our process would take less than 15 years, but it is now clear, and it should have been obvious then, that the resolution of a century-long conflict would be a prolonged and gradual process with many hurdles on its way. 

Today, Israelis and Palestinians must be determined to pursue this process while learning from the deficiencies of Oslo. Indeed, Israelis and Palestinians saw the peace process as a means for advancing political and traditional targets and not as a goal in and of itself. 

Israel aimed to enhance its security by entering a peace process, while the Palestinians endeavored to realize their national aspirations. It has been evident throughout the process that when reconciliation is not a target in itself, even traditional goals will not be reached. Peaceful coexistence and cooperative goals can be achieved in a compatible way, which is actually the true premise of peace. 

Issues negotiated included notions of territory, security, the civilian authority of the Palestinian Authority and mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO. Common interests were secondary concerns. Yet this myopic attitude undermined what strategically would be the most important issue to be orchestrated--future relations between Israel and Palestine in the political, economic and cultural arenas. 

Furthermore, negotiations were centered on a strategic security dogma. The Israeli team made it clear from the outset of the Oslo process that Israel would maintain overall responsibility for security. Whatever authorities, civil or military, were transferred to the PA, Israel would have the overwhelming right to intervene physically if a security threat developed. Today, however, with the proliferation of terrorism, such a doctrine is no longer appropriate. In simple terms, economy not only outweighs security, but provides security. The growth of the Palestinian economy should have been a clear Israeli security interest. 

A culture of peace was also never stimulated during the Oslo process. Israelis and Palestinians remained foreign to one another (except on the battlefield) and thus people-to-people encounters of any significance were almost non-existent. The mass media also avoided creating a culture of peace. In times of conflict, the media was virtually recruited to the struggle, but during the peace process mutual demonization in the media continued even during days of relative quiet. 

The increased socio-economic gap turned the peace process into a revolution of the wealthy, rather than a means by which to dispense peace dividends equally. Only small elites on both sides of the green line reaped peace dividends. In Israel, the champions of the hi-tech industry acquired capital, while in the PA the higher echelons of the PLO leadership that arrived in the West Bank and Gaza from Tunis enjoyed their international treasure at the end of the rainbow. At best, the middle and lower classes in both societies maintained their standards of living. 

The Oslo process was undoubtedly a historic breakthrough that will most likely lead to the desired two-state solution. Without these peace accords, the West Bank and Gaza might have been annexed to Israel, resulting in total turmoil and anarchy. It took courage and ingenuity. 

Being from the Middle East, we are confused by our dichotomized identity based both in modernity and antiquity. While the process was politically and morally legitimate and ultimately paved the right road, the implementation of the Oslo process was overburdened by the inertia of the past. 

A new model for peace that involves the populations on the ground across all sectors must be embraced. Such a model is based on creating a human infrastructure for peace that breaks down the psychological and social barriers between former enemies. 

The Oslo accords began a process of peacemaking. This process continues to evolve and to reach the people who will ultimately create peace.- Published 15/9/2008 &copy; bitterlemons.org
