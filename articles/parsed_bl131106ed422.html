Last Wednesday I was on my way to the Qassam-battered town of Sderot. A college located there was holding a two-day conference on socio-economic issues, and I was invited to participate in a panel on "the day after", meaning what Israel's agenda should be after the war in Lebanon. En route, I was shaken by the bitter news that IDF artillery shells had hit a dwelling in Beit Hanoun and there were dead and wounded, including women and children.

Despite years of witnessing death in the Arab wars against the Jews, my heart has not hardened to the sight of the dead and the sound of the wailing of bereaved mothers, orphans and fathers and the suffering of the wounded, even if they are the enemy. On the other hand, I knew that now Beit Hanoun would play the role of Kafr Qana in Lebanon three months ago--when Israel mistakenly bombed a civilian target and thus altered the way the world and to some extent Israelis saw the war. From herein, Israel could no longer continue as before with its military operation to clean out the launching sites of rockets fired daily at its civilian population in the western Negev, and particularly in Sderot.

I planned to share my feelings about the Beit Hanoun incident with the audience, which was made up of moshav and kibbutz residents from the Negev, most of them left-wingers, alongside guests from the north and people from the college. But another participant, who lectured before me, preempted me. He told the audience that they could feel sadness but must not feel guilt. When an Israeli shell hits civilians, it is always the result of an error. But the thousands of Qassam rockets the Palestinians have fired in recent years, particularly since Israel left the entire Gaza Strip in last year's disengagement, are aimed mainly at Israel's civilian population. So, too, of course, are the suicide bombings. And so were the katyusha rocket attacks from Lebanon against civilian population concentrations in northern Israel. 

Let's not constantly internalize the accusation hurled at us by a hypocritical world, the speaker told the audience, and not always carry a burden of guilt. When entire villages are slaughtered in Algeria it's not even news, and when Sudanese Arabs carry out genocide in Darfur the world is not shaken and the UN Security Council certainly doesn't convene to condemn someone. But when an errant Israeli artillery shell kills Palestinians, this is the opening news item in most of the media; for editors, the news is more important even than the outcome of the American elections.

It is against the backdrop of the disaster in Beit Hanoun and in the shadow of President Bush's and the Republicans' crushing election defeat that the prime minister of Israel just arrived in Washington. The White House and the State Department expect him, according to media leaks, to present "creative ideas", meaning additional Israeli concessions that might hasten the establishment of a Palestinian state and strengthen the moderate Palestinian forces associated with President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen).

I suggest that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert respond more or less as follows: Abu Mazen cannot be strengthened, because he is weak. He is not a leader and never will be. Furthermore, the Israeli bank of concessions is suffering from an impossible overdraft. Gaza disengagement, in which Israel leveled 27 flourishing settlements and exiled their residents against their will left Israeli society in a state of shock that could last for generations. And what was the Palestinian response to this far-reaching unilateral Israeli act designed to "strengthen moderate forces"? Escalated terror attacks against Israeli civilians, particularly by launching hundreds of Qassam rockets into the Negev.

Previous concessions as well, after Oslo for example, did not lead the Palestinians to concentrate on building the foundations of their state-in-the-making. Rather, they ushered in a wave of extended and vicious terrorism that has thus far taken the lives of some 2,000 Israelis through suicide bombings, rocket attacks on civilian Jewish population and roadside ambushes. Concessions to terrorism, as President George W. Bush always declares, only increase the appetite of the terrorists.

Olmert should also mention that the Palestinians are not currently interested in the solution proposed by the American president: two states for two peoples. They would rather continue the bloodshed because as they understand matters, the superior demographic growth rate of the Arabs--those inside Israel, and not beyond the green line--will in the long run, together with the unending terrorism that Israel has difficulty dealing with, overwhelm the Jewish state. 

Under these circumstances, the prime minister of Israel should state in concluding his remarks to the president, American pressure on Israel to make even bigger concessions will only strengthen the Palestinian extremists--along with the rest of the fanatics in the Arab and Muslim world--and encourage them to step up their acts of terror. And this, the president of the United States certainly does not want.- Published 13/11/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org
