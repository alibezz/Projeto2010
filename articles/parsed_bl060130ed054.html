Hamas emerged the victorious party in the January 25, 2006 Palestinian elections. This is bad news primarily for the Palestinians. Israelis, their most immediate neighbors, have good reasons to be concerned as well.

The Hamas electoral victory reflects a larger phenomenon in the Arab world--the growing estrangement of the masses from the current leaders, and the failure of the Arab states to modernize their countries and to bring prosperity to their people. Concomitantly, fundamentalist Islamic organizations have filled the vacuum of governance by providing welfare services and by channeling the widespread frustrations toward greater religiosity.  
  
Similarly, the surprising electoral outcome in the Palestinian Authority was primarily the result of the colossal failures of the ruling party, Fateh. Given the opportunity of self-rule in 1993, the Fateh leadership established a corrupt, inefficient, lawless and authoritarian political system, which eventually degenerated into chaos and disorder. The main failure of the Fateh-led PA was in the area most critical to state-building--monopoly over the use of force.

In contrast, the Hamas leadership acquired popularity by providing welfare and education services to the people, and by establishing a reputation for honesty. Moreover, the armed wing of Hamas has been at the forefront of the extremely popular terrorist campaign against Israel. Yet it is questionable whether or not Hamas will be able to transcend Yasser Arafat's political legacy.

The mere fact that the Palestinians could only choose between these two alternatives testifies to the depressing reality within Palestinian society. It is a frustrated society, mesmerized by force, clearly displaying pathological dysfunctionalities.
  
Unfortunately, however, Hamas is an unlikely candidate for reforming Palestinian society in a positive direction. Essentially, Hamas represents a fundamentalist political force that regards modernity and western values as dangerous decadence and an affront to its version of Islam. It is unlikely to serve as a modernizing agent by welcoming integration into a globalized economy, improving standards of education or allowing women equality. Moreover, Hamas is not in any way committed to democracy. The 2006 elections may well become the last free elections for some time to come. If Hamas stays in power, it will establish a polity in the image of the Taliban regime, which is inimical to a Palestinian journey into modernity. A Hamastan dooms the Palestinians to backwardness, poverty, and easy recruitment of fanatic terrorists. 

While Hamas is capable of tactical flexibility, the expectation that it will become a moderate force in Palestinian politics is mere wishful thinking. The role models for the Hamas leadership are Mahmoud Ahmedinezhad, the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hizballah in Lebanon. Both, enemies of the West and its culture, have nourished relations with Hamas.

The most important domestic challenge confronting Hamas is to impose law and order. Yet it is not likely that the Fateh-linked militias will disarm in light of the election results and accept the new authority. We have already witnessed the first violent reactions. The struggle over control of the organs of force may well bring about bloody confrontations and even civil war. 

This portends a political climate inhospitable to regular economic activity and growth. Moreover, the PA is heavily dependent upon foreign aid and the recent political developments are likely to hinder transfer of aid by the international community. 

For Israel, a Hamas-controlled PA primarily means the continuation of the conflict. The growing influence of Hamas will inevitably harden Palestinian positions against Israel, making an agreement more difficult to reach. Ideologically, Hamas opposes recognition of Israel. It may decide on a truce, but the competition among the armed factions will assure the continuation of terrorist attacks. Hamas will educate additional generations of Palestinians to regard Jews as those who stole their land and will attribute to them characteristics taken from the crudest anti-Semitic motifs. The shaheed will continue to be the role model for Palestinian children. These messages already form part of the consensus in Palestinian society.

Israel's stance must be clear. Jerusalem must demand recognition, cancellation of the Hamas covenant and cessation of all hostilities. Terrorism must be dealt with harshly. Moreover, the Hamas takeover constitutes an opportunity to establish reciprocity as the yardstick for Israeli policies. Only good Palestinian behavior should warrant Israeli aid. It is plain senseless to allow the transfer of funds, the supply of electricity, water, health services, and access to the Israeli labor market to neighbors who pray for Israel's demise. The Palestinian people voted Hamas into power and they should bear the consequences.

Such an uncompromising policy is probably what the enlightened world is expecting from Israel. Even the moderate Arab regimes, such as Egypt and Jordan, expect Israel to strongly oppose Hamas, whose electoral victory emboldens the radical elements in their societies and elsewhere. Only a Hamas failure can bring about a positive change among the Palestinians. Unfortunately, it falls upon Jerusalem to be the light unto the nations in the struggle against the darkest forces on earth.- Published 30/1/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org
