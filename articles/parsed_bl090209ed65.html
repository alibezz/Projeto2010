We have never been so close to an agreement with our Palestinian neighbors--yet never so far.

The last 15 years since Oslo have been years of missed opportunities and foot-dragging: one step forward, two backward. It is no longer at all clear that the solution of two states for two peoples is feasible. There are too many fait accompli on the ground, too much bad blood flowing in our veins, some of which is shared as if by Siamese twins. It is doubtful any separation operation would succeed, nor is it clear what surgeon is capable of performing such a complicated operation. 

No wonder, then, that more and more people on both sides are desperately eulogizing the two states and instead dredging up the idea of one state for the two peoples.

There are no good peoples or bad peoples; no peoples who by their nature are peaceable or warlike. The differences are in the leaderships, and only there. A responsible, courageous and farsighted leadership will formulate policy accordingly and move in that direction. An adventurous, cowardly leadership that can't see beyond the present day will adopt policies without vision that lead nowhere.

The Israeli and Palestinian tragedy is one of leadership. In our camp are the Likud, Kadima and Labor, among which there is no substantive difference. And in the Palestinian camp there are wild Hamas and corrupt Fateh. Recently, Israel too has taken the road of corruption and is making good progress there.

The Palestinian camp is torn and divisive; its main preoccupation is internal rivalries. The same goes for the Israeli camp, where the only missing organ is a backbone. Both of these poor peoples are falling victim to the selfish and opportunistic political struggles in their midst.

Any healing of the Palestinian divisions--between Gaza and the West Bank, between Hamas and Fateh--currently seems a distant possibility. The approaching elections in Israel will most likely produce a political establishment incapable of deciding. What happened in Israel in the past is what will be in the future, and whoever was in power will return to power, while the conflict will only get more angry and ugly. A narrow right wing government in Jerusalem or a government of national unity--both promise nothing. It's even hard to know which coalition is preferable: one from the nationalist right that unmasks the real Israeli policy, or one that pretends to be moderate and makes noises about dialogue while in fact wasting time and, in the best case, going nowhere. Perhaps we're better off with the extremist Avigdor Lieberman: he'll drag Israel down to a place from which it will have to extract itself as quickly as possible.

Palestinian and Israeli politicians are like the prisoner who won't agree to be released from jail. They will not succeed of their own volition in throwing off the chains of trauma, paranoia, prejudice and historic grudges. Hence there is no alternative but to expropriate the solution of this conflict from the hands of the locals.

The past eight years were distinguished by political and security mayhem. The leader of the world, the United States, abandoned the Middle East to its doctrine of power: the power of power, a pseudo-evangelical belief in the power of the military not as the extension of a comprehensive and intelligent policy but rather as its substitute. The new administration in Washington, aware of the power at its disposal, the power of the superpower, addresses it in different terms: "wise power", they call it now. Will this wisdom now finally reach our shores too?

What did the Middle East get out of the boycott and stick policy of George W. Bush, Richard Cheney and Condoleezza Rice? They boycotted Iran and Syria, Hamas and Hizballah, yet the "blacklisted" were not particularly impressed by America's anger. Paradoxically, it was American deterrence that was badly shattered, and when that happens the fragments fly directly into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Washington is itself boycotted even as it boycotts others, and is no longer perceived as a mediator.

The new administration in Washington has to begin talking to anyone who is ready to talk to it. It has to restore the carrots to its arsenal of sticks and boycotts. Above all, it has to position itself at the head of a broad global and regional initiative that generates an interim international mandate for the occupied territories until we are rid of extremism and fanaticism. This is the solution--there is no other, unless we intend to continue limping along the same old paths that were long ago tried and found wanting. If Israelis are held hostage by the settlers and the Palestinians by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, then the Americans, Europeans and moderate Islamic countries must come and release them from their chains.

This week's elections in Israel are not very important. Nor will the results of elections held in the Palestinian Authority--the Gaza Strip and West Bank--be very important if indeed they are held this year as promised. The fate of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict now rests with the international community. If the world chooses to intervene directly and, as President Barack Obama states, "aggressively", then there is still a slim chance of a way out. If it does not--if it continues to make do with sanctimonious statements--then this chance too will disappear and the conflict will remain in a dead end until the next big war breaks out.- Published 9/2/2009 &copy; bitterlemons.org
