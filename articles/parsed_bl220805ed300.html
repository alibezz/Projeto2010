The emerging international status of the Gaza Strip is a tale of unsustainable Israeli objectives and growing international influence. Nothing has been determined with finality yet, but the direction is clear. 

When Prime Minister Ariel Sharon finalized the Gaza disengagement plan in early 2004 he almost certainly intended to cut Gaza off not only from Israel but from the West Bank. This corresponded with the strategy he had adopted for the territories in the course of several decades: fragment the Palestinian presence geographically, demographically, and politically to ensure Israeli control. The disengagement plan called for Israeli economic interaction with the Gaza Strip to end within a few years, and to be replaced by international investment; Sharon at the time rejected Egypt's demand that he ensure safe passage between Gaza and the West Bank as a condition for its assistance and participation. In the course of the ensuing months it emerged that Israel also sought to remove Gaza from the customs envelope that has prevailed between Israel and the Palestinian Authority since the Paris Agreement in 1995.

In parallel, Sharon was trying to construct the West Bank security fence deep inside Palestinian territory; he even fantasized about an "eastern fence" that would cut the West Bank mountain heartland off from the Jordan Valley. At the time, beyond Sharon's commitment to leave Gaza and the northern West Bank, which many Israelis were understandably skeptical about, it looked like business as usual for the man who had done more than any other Israeli to create a demographic and geographic interlock between Israel and Palestine that appeared to doom the prospect of a two-state solution.

That image began to change radically in the course of the past year or so, as Sharon's thinking gradually adapted to the political ramifications of the unilateral concepts of disengagement and a security fence, and to the growing international participation and approval required to make the plan work. The fence today embraces less than 10 percent of the West Bank, including in and around Jerusalem. Sharon talks about holding on to the settlement blocs that abut the green line--even going so far as to claim that disengagement enabled him to extract a guarantee to that effect from President Bush--but he increasingly appears to understand that Israel will have to get out of the mountain heartland and the Jordan Valley, meaning everything beyond the fence. Gaza is part of this concept: yielding to pressure from the Quartet's envoy, James Wolfensohn, and the Bush administration, Sharon has agreed to institute safe passage, thereby ensuring an ongoing economic and political link between Gaza and the West Bank. 

The issue of Gaza's economic status--with or without an Israeli customs envelope--has not yet been resolved, and there are ongoing security concerns regarding Gaza's borders. But the principle of international participation, including by Egypt, in the decision-making process regarding these issues has been established. Hence it is not likely that the coming weeks and months will witness the emergence of a status for Gaza that somehow detaches it from the West Bank.

Unless Hamas takes over Gaza. If, in the aftermath of disengagement, the PA/PLO under Mahmoud Abbas proves unable to assert its authority in the Strip and Hamas emerges as the de facto ruler there, the Israeli approach, conceivably with Egypt's tacit acceptance, could conceivably revert to an attempt to isolate and detach Gaza. This could happen the moment the IDF leaves the scene, if the scramble to reclaim the territory of the Gaza settlements degenerates into chaos. Or it could happen after elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council in late January, if Hamas scores an overwhelming victory in the Strip.

The unity of Gaza and the West Bank was established by the Oslo agreements. Israel needs for these territories to be unified economically and politically if there is to be any chance of creating a viable Palestinian state. And a viable Palestinian state is needed in order for Israel to remain Jewish and democratic. 

Accordingly, the future status of Gaza is a test both of Sharon's political wisdom and of Abbas' leadership skills.- Published 22/8/2005 (c) bitterlemons-international.org
