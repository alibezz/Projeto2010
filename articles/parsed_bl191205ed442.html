With elections approaching in Israel and the territories, both sides are experiencing shocks that call into question political concepts as well as party frameworks. The ruling parties, Likud and Fateh, are paying a heavy price for their difficulties in adapting their ideologies to changes in the mood of the Israeli public and the Palestinian street.

The primary catalyst of these changes is Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his decision to withdraw unilaterally from the Gaza Strip and remove four settlements from the northern West Bank. His success in removing 7,000 settlers and freeing Israel of responsibility for over a million and a half Palestinians changed the agenda of the ruling parties in Israel and the territories. That dramatic move cast doubt on the Likud's traditional strategy and led to a schism between tough ideological loyalists and pragmatists and opportunists. 

In Palestine the reverse happened: the unilateral approach pulled the rug out from under the pragmatists, the Oslo circle that advocates a political approach, and rendered them irrelevant. This played into the hands of both Hamas, which opposes political compromise with Israel, and the young Fatah leadership that knows how to exploit the inability of the veterans to persuade their Israeli "partners" to provide even measly concessions like convoys between Gaza and the West Bank, removal of checkpoints and release of prisoners.

The split within the Likud and the mass move to Sharon's new party, Kadima, are likely to end Likud rule and push the other traditional ruling party, Labor, into second place. In contrast to the argument of most Israeli political analysts, and despite the new doubts surrounding Sharon's health, Kadima's strategy will remain popular; it won't disappear when Sharon leaves the political arena. Kadima might lose some public support, but its strategy has already moved to the center of the Israeli political debate. Leftists will vote for Kadima because they don't believe the Likud wants to get out of the territories--and don't believe Labor can.

The Likud symbolizes the stagnation of the peace process, while Labor promises to renew it. The opinion polls tell us that a large majority of the Israeli public supports renewed negotiations but doesn't believe there is a Palestinian partner. Kadima proposes to part with the majority of Palestinians without waiting for the emergence of a negotiating partner. Any lingering doubts about the lack of a Palestinian partner were dispelled by the split within Fateh and Hamas' massive achievement in local elections. 

In the territories as in Israel, the public is fed up with the political establishment because of the image projected by the leadership: corrupt and power-hungry politicians. For years Kadima's leaders, and first and foremost Sharon, were part and parcel of that same gang. But they have successfully shaken off the negative image and pinned it instead on the Likud Central Committee. Their apparent determined aspiration to dismantle most of the settlements and isolate the Palestinians behind a fence has reinforced their new image.

Alongside the ideological and organizational factors, the human element is at work on both sides. Sharon's determination to carry out redeployment made him the most popular political personality in Israel since David Ben Gurion. He is considered the only leader who can implement far-reaching political moves while maintaining internal consensus and wholehearted international support. Neither Binyamin Netanyahu nor Amir Peretz can offer the public Sharon's combination of charisma, experience and close relations with the US president, all wrapped up in a fresh new party where you can find everything: right, left, center, a campaigner for secular rights alongside an ultra-orthodox activist, labor union leaders together with captains of industry. 

Fateh's traditional leadership suffers from the absence of a leader like Sharon who could step into Yasser Arafat's shoes. The grey, uncharismatic Abu Mazen (President Mahmoud Abbas) has failed to fill the vacuum. Sharon and President Bush are not volunteering to help him, and Hamas misses no opportunity to trip him up and gain points.

However the political forces in Israel and the territories line up in the end, the changes in both sides' political maps do not appear to bespeak good news for the voters.- Published 19/12/2005 &copy; bitterlemons.org
