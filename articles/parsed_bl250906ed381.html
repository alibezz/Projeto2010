The weeks since the war in Lebanon have witnessed a gradual increase in the regional and international political attention granted the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in general and the internal Palestinian economic, political and security situation in particular. 

This started with a growing realization among many Arab leaders of the urgency to move toward reviving a political process and resume international efforts to alleviate the increasing suffering of Palestinians. In order to make that task possible, efforts were exerted to try to improve the internal Palestinian political situation to make it more amenable to international political efforts.

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, also head of Fateh, thus went through an extensive and constructive dialogue with his prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas. The dialogue had the two objectives of creating a national unity government with a political platform that the international community could work with. 

While Europe responded positively to these efforts, in the understanding that this is of necessity a gradual process that needs to be encouraged in order to be sustainable, the American administration was dismissive of Abbas' efforts. 

And while it may be true that the guidelines agreed on by Abbas and Haniyeh for that government were not identical with the Quartet's positions, the fact that the agreement moved in that direction was a sign of progress that needed to be appreciated and encouraged. 

But the obstacles Abbas faced in the US and those he faced in Gaza instead reinforced each other. The American administration seemed to think Abbas hadn't been transparent enough and had given them an overoptimistic picture of the provisional unity government agreement. Rather then encourage efforts that, however slowly, were moving in the right direction, the US position discouraged the effort and consequently had an immediate negative effect on the ongoing dialogue.

Meanwhile, statements out of Gaza contradicting the impression Abbas was trying to create in the US were used by US officials to counter the president's attempts to attract support for this internal process. 

Now back in Palestine, Abbas is finding things deteriorating rapidly and dramatically on two vital levels. First, his authority is gradually eroding. If this is allowed to continue that authority may collapse completely. It is eroding in step with the erosion of the Palestinian Authority itself.

PA employees have not been paid for months, causing serious unrest. Even before that, and due to Israeli measures, the security sector was almost non-existent. In the West Bank, divided as it is by Israeli checkpoints, no coherent security system can function. In Gaza, real authority lies with families and militias, undermining any centralized effort. Now, a general strike, mainly of education and health sector employees, has left the PA completely paralyzed. 

The second deterioration is the growing tension in Gaza, in the form of sporadic clashes and a series of assassinations between Fateh and Hamas that might lead to security chaos or full-scale civil war in the Strip. This tension is aided by the deepening of poverty and unemployment, fertile soil for an increase in internecine violence. 

We have not yet reached the point of no return, but if things are left as they are we will get there sooner rather than later. There are urgent requirements on all players. 

First, the leaders of both Fateh and Hamas have to come to the conclusion that, on the one hand, none of them will be able to govern successfully alone, and on the other, any government comprising both must have policies compatible with international legality. If this does not happen, both will be responsible for what follows. 

Second, powerful and influential regional countries have to start playing a constructive role rather than be the negative influence many of them have been so far. There is no doubt that many countries in the region are either influencing and encouraging--politically, ideologically and/or financially--certain groups in the Palestinian arena or avoiding to do so at a time when they could be useful. 

Internationally, there has to be progress on both the economic and political levels. Economically, the "temporary international mechanism" that has been benefiting the health sector must be extended to include the education sector. That could rescue the humanitarian situation without political risk on behalf of the donors. 

Politically, it is simply not enough for the international community to sit idly by watching the internal Palestinian situation and evaluating whether this or that internal move meets with approval or not. The international community must take a proactive approach of the kind that will encourage moderation rather than vice versa. 

In addition, the international community has to pressure Israel to ease its draconian restrictions on Palestinians and stop its campaign of violence and assassinations. These illegal measures have only been contributing to the economic hardship suffered by Palestinians and encouraged radicalization.- Published 25/9/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org
