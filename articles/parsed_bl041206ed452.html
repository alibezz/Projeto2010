The usual question about a ceasefire is whether it will hold. The more important question is whether it will contribute to longer-term prospects for peace or actually pave the path to a future war. In other words, what matters is not the ceasefire itself, but whether it will be taken as an opportunity to change the circumstances that brought about the fighting and that threaten to lead to resumed conflict.

To understand the factors in play, we must go back a short time to Israel's complete and unilateral withdrawal from Gaza in August 2005. This was a turning point at which the Palestinians had to decide whether to continue attacking Israel, especially from Gaza, or to return to a strategy of achieving their objectives through negotiations. 

Following the Israeli withdrawal, Hamas won parliamentary elections in January 2006 on a platform of combating corruption and improving the dismal Palestinian domestic situation. Yet once in power, Hamas quickly allowed and joined in rocket attacks against Israel from Gaza, leading to Israeli military responses, thereby plunging Gaza back into the exhausting conflict from which most Palestinians presumably sought respite.

Why did Hamas do this? One answer is that of the scorpion who, in the famous parable, explains to the bewildered frog he has just stung, before they both drown in a river the frog was carrying him across: "because that is what scorpions do." That may be true, but there are additional factors that have greatly exacerbated the situation.

The first is that since the Israeli withdrawal, Egypt has not prevented large quantities of weapons of increasing sophistication from being smuggled into Gaza. Presumably these weapons could be stockpiled, as many are, rather than used, but such an inflow of weaponry certainly strengthens the hand of those advocating no let up in attacks against Israel. 

Secondly, this pressure to attack Israel increased after the Lebanon war this summer, since those advocating aggression could argue that Hizballah had proven that even a relatively small guerrilla army could hold its own against the Israeli military. Why make peace with Israel--considered surrender by those who wish to destroy the Jewish state--when Israel has proven its weakness?

Thirdly, despite the fact that the United Nations Security Council clearly blamed Hizballah for starting the war by attacking Israel on July 12, that same body continues to blame Israel for being attacked by the Palestinians. This is seen by the fact that months of Qassam rocket attacks on Israeli civilians produce no concern at the UN, which leaps into action when Israel, tragically but accidentally, kills Palestinian civilians in its military response. 

This UN formula of blaming the victim greatly encourages attacks against Israel; Hamas would be crazy not to attack Israel when such attacks effectively serve to increase Israel's isolation and, ironically, relieve pressure for diplomatic concessions that Hamas has no desire to make. 

Lastly, the sense that the international community is becoming less likely to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons is already increasing the power of radical forces across the region, both because of direct Iranian funding and influence and because these radicals are considered a growing force that is dangerous to resist.

The way, then, to not only make the ceasefire hold but to move away from the seemingly inevitable next war is to address each of these negative factors: 


 The United States should tell Cairo that if it acts like Damascus and allows itself to become a weapons funnel to radical forces, then US military and financial aid will be jeopardized.

 The full Quartet should join the US not only in rejecting "blame the victim" resolutions at the UN, but should introduce resolutions condemning Palestinian aggression against Israel and supporting Israel's right to self-defense. 


 The more the international community is seen as unable to enforce its own resolutions regarding Lebanese independence and against Iranian nuclearization, the weaker those Palestinians and Lebanese seeking a more peaceful future will become. Capitulation on these other issues will have a direct impact on the Arab-Israel conflict. 




The West, including Israel, is under attack by the axis Israel fought during the recent war: Hamas, Hizballah, Syria and Iran. That war, while initially demonstrating Israeli military prowess and the Israeli public's incredible fortitude under fire, quickly came to symbolize Israeli weakness and vulnerability. This performance, coupled with the western refusal to impose minimal sanctions against Iran let alone convincingly confront it, will likely embolden this entire axis and lead to an increase in terrorism. 

Under such circumstances, no ceasefire has a chance of survival or of becoming the basis for something more promising. At the same time, if the West wakes up and changes course as suggested, the chances would be good to set positive trends in motion--not only between Israel and the Palestinians, but in Lebanon, Iraq, and Afghanistan, where the radical axis is working hard to undermine western objectives.- Published 4/12/2006 &copy; bitterlemons.org
