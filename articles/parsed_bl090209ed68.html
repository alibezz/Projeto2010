The average Palestinian has not shown much interest in the Israeli elections, even if the campaign has been covered comprehensively in the print and electronic media in Palestine and on the satellite stations of the Arab world. 

The reason for this lack of concern is the general impression among Palestinians that Israeli politicians are all the same. Successive Israeli governments--whether led by Labor or Likud--have failed to prove to Palestinians that Israel wants just peace. What Palestinians have instead witnessed down the many years of occupation is a persistent and intensive effort to build settlements or expand existing ones in a manner that does not leave any room for a future Palestinian state. The failure of the moderate Palestinian leadership to fulfill its promises to bring an end to the Israeli occupation has contributed much to Palestinian frustrations.

Private conversations, however, betray a feeling of unease on behalf of the Palestinian political leadership regarding the future of Palestinian-Israeli contacts. Those contacts have for the past years been handled by Ehud Olmert, the outgoing prime minister, and Tzipi Livni, the foreign minister. The latter now looks set to lose out to Likud's Binyamin Netanyahu in elections that could give rise to a right-wing coalition that has no interest in making peace with the Palestinians based on the principles of "land for peace" and "two states for the two peoples". The past experience of Netanyahu in 1996 provides a strong and concrete basis for such fears.

The Israeli election campaign has proven to be a battle of two blocs rather than of individual parties. The leaders on the right have taken turns complimenting each other, in the belief that any gain for any right-wing party is a gain for Netanyahu. Opinion polls have consistently shown about a 10-seat advantage for the Right over the so-called Left. According to these polls, Likud, Yisrael Beitenu and the rest of the Right stand to garner some 66 parliamentary seats to 54 for Kadima, Labor, Meretz and the Arab parties (who in any case would not be invited into any coalition). 

With Ehud Barak, the hawkish defense minister and head of Labor, expected to accept to continue in his post under Netanyahu, a Netanyahu-led government could enjoy the support of more than 80 members of the Knesset. In the light of such a likely outcome, Palestinian unease should be easy to understand. 

Netanyahu has campaigned on a promise that Israel will never negotiate over the Golan Heights, the Jordan Valley or Jerusalem. The Jerusalem zoning plan integrates all satellite settlements around Jerusalem, from the borders of Ramallah in the north, east almost to the borders of Jericho and south, down to Efrat, beyond Bethlehem. This area alone takes almost 20 percent of the West Bank besides dividing it into two major separate units each with its own bantustans, surrounded by more settlements. 

Netanyahu never believed in a political solution to the conflict, and he didn't support the unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Nevertheless, with a new administration in the White House he will be keen to avoid a confrontation with President Barack Obama. In his election campaign, he already started speaking about "improving" Palestinian economic conditions by building industrial parks near large Palestinian cities to create jobs and get Palestinians busy with work instead of "terror". 

But this approach to the conflict has been tried before. It has failed because it underestimates the national and political aspirations of the Palestinian people and misunderstands the nature of the historic compromise. The Palestinian demand is an Israel withdrawal to the 1967 lines to make room for a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. This would leave 78 percent of historic Palestine for the State of Israel. That is why it is called the historic compromise. 

The continued internal Palestinian dispute, meanwhile, is also causing fear and frustration among ordinary Palestinians. People might have expected that the Israeli war on Gaza, with all the atrocities that were committed against people there, would present a good opportunity for the leaderships of Hamas and Fateh to compromise and go back to a unified effort for the sake of the Palestinian national interest. 

But in spite of the tragic situation in Gaza and the huge suffering caused by the Israeli invasion there are no signs of reconciliation between the two parties. On the contrary, the struggle over who will be the legitimate address for the expected reconstruction aid to rebuild demolished homes and infrastructure in Gaza is instead increasing tension between the factions and pouring oil on the fire.

The logical position is that now is an opportune moment for Palestinians to try to take advantage of the combination of a new US administration eager to make a fresh start, global sympathy with the civilian victims in Gaza, and conflicting regional interests, in confronting the threat posed by a new right-wing Israeli government. But any benefit that may come from this constellation cannot be reaped unless there is Palestinian unity and a reorganization of the Palestinian political order so that Palestinians can face the world with one voice, one representative and one authority.- Published 9/2/2009 &copy; bitterlemons.org
