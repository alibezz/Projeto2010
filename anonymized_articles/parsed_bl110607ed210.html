Two years ago, when Israel pulled out of Gaza, the Palestinians failed even to consolidate and exploit the elements of sovereignty, such as territorial contiguity and potentially unfettered passage to the Arab world, embodied in Israel's withdrawal initiative. While Israeli mistakes have undoubtedly contributed to and amplified these Palestinian failures, the blame has to be laid first and foremost at the Palestinian doorstep. 

Then, in January 2006, came Hamas' rise to power in the Palestinian Authority. Hamas' rejection of the principle of a two-state solution further reinforced doubts in Israel and the world regarding the ongoing viability of the two-state idea for solving the conflict. 

These developments, in turn, have nurtured speculation in Israel about alternatives. Most prominent among the ideas currently mentioned--some new, some recycled--are a long-term hudna or ceasefire with Hamas, a readiness on the part of Jordan and/or Egypt to reestablish their rule in the West Bank and/or the Gaza Strip, and the possibility of severing the Gaza-West Bank link and letting each territory go its separate way.

Nor is such speculation limited to Israel. Some prominent Jordanians have begun to discuss the necessity and advisability of a more active Jordanian role in the West Bank, to the extent of reviving long-dormant ideas about East Bank/West Bank federation or confederation. And some media reports indicate that Palestinian public opinion is increasingly open to discussion of renewing full-fledged Israeli occupation as a last ditch alternative to growing anarchy.

Yet we must be extremely wary of succumbing to the temptation to conclude that the two-state solution is no longer viable. If we have learned anything from the events of the past 20 years in the Israeli-Palestinian sphere, it is that no development, trend or dynamic is irreversible. The Oslo accords did not, as many predicted back in the 1990s, prevent a return to open conflict. Current speculation about the IDF reoccupying all or parts of the Gaza Strip reflects the insight that Israel's unilateral withdrawal was not necessarily the last word in that department, either.

How could we conceivably get back to a serious attempt to activate a two-state solution? One obvious precondition is the emergence of more determined and talented leadership--in Jerusalem, Ramallah and Washington. Another favorable development could be a greater readiness on the part of the moderate Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, to actively "chaperone" the process within the framework of the Arab peace initiative. They could, for example, agree to negotiate in areas where the PLO has failed to come up with workable compromises, such as the right of return and Jerusalem, that involve broader Arab interests. 

Were Fateh to overcome Hamas in elections or even by force of arms in a civil war, one outcome could be the revival of a viable negotiating process over a two-state solution. Alternatively, successful Israeli-Syrian negotiations that produced a peace agreement, closed the circle of reconciliation between Israel and its Arab state neighbors and cut Hamas off from outside sources of funding and supply could persuade Palestinians they had no alternative but to make the concessions necessary for a successful two-state agreement.
