To what degree it will be a credible process that avoids all the pitfalls of the Oslo "peace process" is an open question, however. What is unquestionable since the end of last June, when the Israeli army invaded Gaza, is that the planned second "unilateral" withdrawal from the West Bank is shelved and "unilateralism" has failed.

The purpose behind such withdrawals was in part to generate "movement" to fill the political vacuum resulting from freezing the "roadmap", to which the Israeli cabinet under former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon appended fourteen conditions for it to be acceptable. Sharon succeeded in convincing the Bush administration to support unilateral withdrawals in lieu of a political process, and thus fill the political vacuum resulting from the failure to quell the second intifada by military means. 

The shelving of "unilateralism", being its only agenda, left Kadima without a raison d'etre. But the war on Lebanon created yet another need for a political process if regional alliances stretching to Palestine were to be separated, all in the context of a failing US policy in Iraq and the possibility of a wider regional conflagration that many US allies in the Middle East fear.

Leaks in the Hebrew press concerning a "peace plan" being prepared by Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni appeared several weeks ago. In a December 29 interview in Haaretz, she herself made the broad outlines clear. Her "operative diplomatic plan", as she described it, involves "dividing up the country" with the separation wall as the "reference point". A Palestinian state with "temporary" borders is to be established, with a "final status" agreement to be left for the future.

There isn't much new in the plan, except that it has come from an Israeli and American point of view. In addition to the regional situation, the withdrawal from Gaza was proof that Israel needs a Palestinian partner, and this requires "movement" on the political front. In terms of substance, the nominal threshold from "expanded self rule" envisioned by earlier Israeli politicians to a "state" with the "trappings of sovereignty" has already been crossed. Sharon himself said in an interview shortly after he became prime minister in early 2001 that he is not opposed to a Palestinian "state" in half of the West Bank. 

Evidently, not much has been learned from the failures of the Oslo process. It is clear that open-ended "interim" arrangements have a way of extending their life expectancy until another conflagration erupts. The problem is not in principle with stages, but with the specific guarantees that the end-goal will be reached in a defined period, if such "guarantees" are at all possible or credible. The Israeli-Palestinian "peace process" attests to this.

No wonder then that President Mahmoud Abbas continues to call for immediate final negotiations, while rejecting the idea of a "state with temporary borders", especially if the final outcome is not agreed upon before the beginning of any political process. 

What we should therefore expect in this new year are even more difficult negotiations than at any time before. Yet there is an opportunity for a credible political process provided two conditions apply. First, the solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should not be left as a domestic Israeli issue governed by the electoral and local needs of Israeli politicians. It is clear that here there is a need for an impartial and vigorous Arab and international role, a role the US has not played and could not play given Israeli influence on its policies in the Middle East.
