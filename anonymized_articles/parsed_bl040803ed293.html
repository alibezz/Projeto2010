The committee also had a Palestinian and an American chair. The three chairmen met together to devise a common denominator for creating a mechanism to remove improper language from the media, with the objective of improving the atmosphere and generating an enhanced infrastructure for renewed deliberations between Israelis and Palestinians, in anticipation of the advent of a new spring in the relations between the two peoples.

The committee's deliberations were cut off by the intifada; its renewal is currently the subject of serious discussion. 

The Palestinian delegation to the committee was headed by Marwan Kanafani. It quickly became apparent to me and my Israeli colleagues that Kanafani behaved completely differently in full committee meetings, when all members were present, than in the private meetings he held with me in the course of our many months of work. In other words, there was almost no progress in the committee discussions, whereas in our private meetings, sometimes in the presence of United States Ambassador Martin Indyk, it was evident that we could register progress and reach agreements toward some sort of arrangement.

The Palestinian delegation included several members who were appointed by Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and apparently reported directly and independently to him about our discussions, the atmosphere of our deliberations and the conclusions reached. While this was not an open issue during the duration of the committee's activity, it was undoubtedly a reality that made life difficult for the Palestinian chair and rendered his activities more extreme.

Hence my conclusion that Kanafani and I would achieve useful results for both sides as long as the committee remained a cover that enabled us to chart our own path, without interfering directly in our discussions. This was the first and primary lesson I drew from the long months of committee activity. I would regularly report back to the Israeli delegation regarding the achievements or the disagreements with the Palestinians that came up in my meetings with Kanafani.

The Incitement Committee held two public meetings in the presence of all the delegations, one in Jerusalem and one in Gaza, while Kanafani and I held many private meetings. I quickly concluded that we should institutionalize these meetings, because they enabled us to reach progress and better understanding without having to encounter the difficulties engendered by the allegiances of the members of the Palestinian delegation. The latter presented a united front. They always closed ranks with Arafat and backed his position; never did I discern a deviation from his views.

Nor could I, in these meetings, give expression to the understandings we had reached in our private meetings. On several occasions Kanafani emphasized that these understandings were private and could not be shared with the committee plenum.

At the personal level, Kanafani and I developed a relationship based on trust and mutual respect. When he was hospitalized in Israel for an operation I visited him, and met his family there. But these improved personal relations had no effect on the overall conduct of the committee.

This leads to the conclusion that the joint committee's performance, particularly on the Palestinian side, is a product first and foremost of the status of the Palestinian chair, his knowledge of the material at hand and his desire to reach arrangements that will reflect progress in the committee's work. In the course of personal discussions, it was possible for Marwan Kanafani and I to make substantive progress concerning Palestinian or Israeli violations of the agreement to prevent incitement. The committee's work reflected to a large extent Kanafani's desire to register achievements without insisting on minor and non-substantive details.

Turning to the Israeli side, Barak apparently sought to give the Israeli delegation freedom of maneuver with regard to general policy lines. My approach was never questioned by the prime minister or any of his ministers placed in charge of the committee. One of the latter, Haim Ramon, sought to assist us actively through his personal contacts with senior Palestinians.
