Even before departing for the opening session, instead of reading headlines in the New York Times and Washington Post that generate a modicum of hope, along with press clippings from the Palestinian and Israeli media, he would have seen the reports from Damascus, where the "alternative conference" was meeting. 

His advisers would have underlined in red the "nos" emanating from the Palestinian refusalist camp. It's not hard to guess what they would say: a big "no" to "bending" to PM Ehud Olmert and "bowing" to President George W. Bush; a reminder that Abbas has "repeatedly ignored the dilemma of the Palestinian people as it struggles under the yoke of occupation". 

The same old slogans and cliches--yet the timing and circumstances will work in the refusalist camp's favor. There, in Damascus, the job is much easier than in Annapolis. The heads of the Palestinian refusalist organizations will hasten to accuse Abu Mazen of betraying the right of return of the Palestinian refugees and not insisting on the division between Yerushalayim and al-Quds. They will explain that the chances of establishing an independent Palestinian state have diminished insofar as Israel has again evaded its responsibility to dismantle settlements. Unless the border separating Israel and the West Bank is established as the 1967 line, they will warn in Damascus, the dream of an independent state will evaporate and disappear and history will judge Abu Mazen harshly.

Whatever concluding announcement emerges from the Annapolis conference this fall will be interpreted in the negative by the Damascus "alternatives". The heads of the refusalist organizations will summon the press to hear their sad conclusion: Israel has once again triumphed at the expense of the Palestinians, while Abu Mazen persists in his weakness. Even if someone from the media attempts to present a Palestinian "gain", such as freezing of settlement construction or the release of aid funds, they will be told in Damascus, "there is no chance these agreements will pass the test of reality."

Thus it was a smart move in Damascus to postpone the convening of the alternative conference from November 7, when the refusalists had planned to tie the hands of the Palestinian Annapolis delegation in advance, to a date that corresponds with the actual Annapolis meeting. (According to unconfirmed reports, certain Fateh sources actually claimed that Syria was now inclined to refuse to host the alternative meeting at all.) If at Annapolis an effort is made to claim achievements that go beyond a photo opportunity, Damascus will launch its own new constraints. Khaled Meshaal, Nayef Hawatmeh, Ahmed Jibril and Farouq Kadumi, the guest of honor from Fateh, will have an easy time functioning as a real time response team. And when the Annapolis conference concludes and Olmert and Abu Mazen shake hands in front of the cameras at the White House and perhaps even sign an agreement under the sponsorship of President Bush, the Palestinian refusalist camp will remind them of the fate of the Oslo accords, and the man who helped make both events happen--Abu Mazen--will flash a particularly sour smile.

In contrast with the obvious lack of enthusiasm displayed by the Arab Annapolis invitees, the alternative meeting participants seem to be overflowing with creativity. On the one hand Egypt is hesitating about Annapolis, Saudi Arabia "has not yet decided" and Jordan warns of a dangerous failure. Only President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan enthusiastically awaits his invitation so he can settle accounts with his homegrown Islamist extremists. In contrast, the response team meeting in Damascus will function like clockwork: for every decision made at Annapolis it will pronounce a "no", issue a "we told you so" warning and recruit spokesmen to state categorically that "without Hamas there is no chance".

And, of course, the fingerprints of the Syrian presidential palace will be all over this meeting of the leadership of the Palestinian refusalist camp. True, President Bashar Assad invited himself to the Annapolis conference and has missed no opportunity to declare his allegiance to peace. But Washington ignored him while Israel declared its refusal to bypass Washington or to manage two peace tracks at once. Finally, the Israel Air Force attack of September 6 seemed to silence the Syrian presidential palace completely.
