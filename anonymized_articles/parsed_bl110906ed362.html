The latter received little international attention, as it has had scant impact on world politics (though it did spill over into India with the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi). The Palestinian phenomenon was usually attributed to specific local conditions, and since most suicide bombers were youngsters coming from refugee camps, most international observers viewed this as just one, albeit extreme, manifestation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

With 15 of the 9/11 suicide murderers being Saudis, perceptions among both commentators and policy-makers changed: no longer was it possible to view suicide bombers as deprived, angry youth from poverty-stricken refugee camps who might also have been victimized by Israeli occupation. As more became known about the 9/11 perpetrators, the more it became clear that many of them (the Egyptian Mohammed Atta being a prime example) came from comfortable, middle-class families with access to education and foreign travel. Moreover, many had families, and the long range planning involved in the operation suggested dedicated people, aware of what they were doing, deeply motivated--not, as in the Palestinian case, angry young men who could easily be manipulated by older men sending them to their deaths.

The phenomenon was thus reevaluated, linking it to a deeply-held belief system: Said Qutub was mentioned, the deeply anti-western and anti-modernist Wahabi education in Saudi schools was for the first time noticed by western observers, extremist madrassas in Pakistan began to feature in journalistic reports and intelligence assessments. Even people who rejected Prof. Samuel Huntington's theory of a clash of civilizations became aware of the fact that a wider, cultural dimension was involved. Few westerners bought the facile Israeli equation of Yasser Arafat with Osama Bin Laden, but more people were ready to view Palestinian suicide terrorism in a wider context--even if they continued to criticize many aspects of Israeli policies in the occupied territories.

Certainly all this had an impact on President George W. Bush's perception of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the chances of peace-making. When the Camp David 2000 debacle was followed by the violence of the second intifada, the Bush administration had no problem in linking suicide bombs in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa with 9/11: the mindset was perceived to be the same, even as all due respect was paid to legitimate Palestinian claims (see the roadmap). But the insistence by the White House that no meaningful negotiations were possible until the Palestinian Authority took the fight against terrorism seriously was certainly linked to the overall perception that there is something in extremist fundamentalist Islam that legitimizes mass terrorism against civilians. 

Palestinians have to thank the people who brought down the Twin Towers for the White House's indifference to Arafat's virtual incarceration in the Muqataa as well as its acquiescence in Israel's policy of building a security fence. With Hamas' victory in the January 2006 elections, not only Washington but also the European Union viewed this as part of a wider, extremist Islamic movement that must be curbed--lofty principles about democracy and elections notwithstanding.

The fact that many of the 9/11 terrorists resided in Europe prior to traveling to the United States also focused attention on the internal security problems emanating from the existence of large Muslim minorities in Europe: terrorist acts in Spain, the UK and now also Germany, as well as political murders carried out by extremist Muslims (as in the Netherlands) brought about more understanding for some of the dilemmas faced by Israel. This also has clear repercussions in the field of security and intelligence gathering.

While it is now clear that 9/11 cannot be traced to Saddam, the shock created by it did legitimate, for most Americans, the invasion of Iraq. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the war, it not only brought down Saddam but also put an end to Sunni hegemony in Iraq, gave rise to the first Shi'ite dominated Arab state, enhanced Iran's influence in Iraq, and created a de facto Kurdish statelet in the north.

It may be too early to assess some of the consequences of these complex developments. Obviously, the messianic and utopian American attempt to impose democracy in Iraq--and consequently in the Arab Middle East--has failed; rulers like King Abdullah of Jordan are understandably worried about a "Shi'ite crescent", and most Saudi and Egyptian statesmen would agree, albeit quietly. 

The impact on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is complex: on the one hand, a weakening of Sunni hegemony (which has always been the leading force of Arab nationalism) and the de facto disappearance of Iraq as a coherent polity could not but be welcomed by Israel; the Palestinians lost both their symbolic Saladin as well as an effective supporter of the families of suicide bombers. At the same time, the strengthening of Iran--the one indisputable result of the fall of Saddam--has encouraged an extreme anti-Israel player in the region, with far-reaching consequences ranging from its nuclear program to deeper support for Hizballah.

The impact of 9/11 on Israel itself has been equally complex. While the initial feeling that "now they will understand us" has not been fully justified, there is no doubt that putting Palestinian suicide terrorism into a wider context has helped Israel find allies in the US as well as in Europe. The EU has been less sympathetic than the US to the building of the fence, yet even European statesmen, when pressed, have had to admit that they have difficulty telling Israel not to defend itself from what Europeans may now understand a bit better.

On the other hand, Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Gaza would have been unthinkable had Iraq still been ruled by Saddam: this too has to be viewed as one of the consequences of the changes in the wake of 9/11. The war in Lebanon has made further unilateral disengagements highly improbable, but the present situation is in its own way also part of the post-9/11 world.
