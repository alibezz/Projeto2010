In the American view, since the conference is likely to be the farewell party of the Bush era, it must succeed. But what are its chances of success?

The American initiative stems from a desire to compensate for ongoing policy failures in the Middle East. Generally speaking, the occupation of Iraq has not enhanced regional stability. To the contrary, anarchy in Iraq, the rise of Iran and the Shi'ites in the Arab world, Hamas' takeover of Gaza and continued growth in al-Qaeda cells all bear witness to the threat posed by the region to world order. Beyond considerations of prestige, the need for a constant flow of oil at reasonable prices is cardinal in western eyes. In view of these problems, progress toward a solution of the Israel-Arab conflict is intended to contribute to a reduction of threats from other sectors and an increase in regional stability. Thus the international conference is an instrument for generating political negotiations in the hope of triggering progress toward solving additional problems.

The conference idea in and of itself is not at all a bad one. First, it ensures that the regional agenda is not determined and dominated by radical Islamists. This is a convenient opportunity for moderate voices in the Arab world to join together and combat the forces that threaten their regimes. Second, there are many indications that Saudi Arabia will be present at the conference. Its participation is most vital insofar as it provides an umbrella of Islamic legitimacy. The KSA has good reason to favor a conference that enhances its standing in Washington and the Arab world. The conference also constitutes a natural extension of the Arab peace plan that began as a Saudi initiative.

Yet the conference idea also generates not a few difficulties. First, priority for the Palestinian track is liable once again to drive Syria toward extremism. Lately there have been quite a few hints regarding the existence of a secret Israeli-Syrian negotiating track; this indicates that Damascus is not necessarily committed ideologically to the radical camp. The US and Israel should not leave Syria out of this conference lest it seek to sabotage it.

Second, the Palestinian track is extremely problematic. The current split between Fateh headed by Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and Hamas bodes ill. Any progress with the one is liable to be vetoed by the other. The attempt by the US and Israel to strengthen Abu Mazen, while helpful in the short-run, is liable to backfire in the long-run. Hamas can make common cause with other regional actors interested in torpedoing any political initiative; an agreement between Abu Mazen and Israel will be condemned as a "betrayal" of the Palestinian cause, thereby rendering its realization that much more difficult.

Correspondingly, an agreement enjoying broad Arab backing will have greater legitimacy and isolate Hamas. Theoretically, Hamas can allow Abu Mazen a degree of diplomatic flexibility on the assumption that he will attain for Hamas what it itself cannot achieve without compromising its principle of non-recognition of Israel--in the hope that it will ultimately "liberate" the West Bank as well.

A third difficulty regarding the conference is that as presently constituted it ignores the Lebanese track. There is currently a struggle in Lebanon over the approaching elections between candidates supported by Iran, Syria and Hizballah and those identified with the opposing camp, with divisions cutting across ethnic community allegiances. Just as the West is trying to strengthen Abu Mazen, so should it strengthen PM Fuad Siniora's pro-western government by inviting it to the conference.

Accordingly, I propose adopting a "multi-bilateral" approach to the conference that would open up a number of simultaneous dialogue tracks: Israeli-Palestinian, Israeli-Syrian, Israeli-Lebanese and Israel-Arab. Each track would have its own separate agenda dealing with its specific problems. The Israel-Arab track would deal with regional issues such as economic cooperation, water, environment and tourism. It would also address the questions of Jerusalem and the refugees that go beyond the Israeli-Palestinian bilateral track.

The multi-bilateral approach has several advantages: it enables the bypassing of anticipated obstacles like Hizballah and Hamas opposition; progress in one track could positively impact the quality of negotiations in a parallel track; it could narrow the confidence and credibility gap that has developed in recent years; and it guarantees pan-Arab legitimization for any agreement reached.
