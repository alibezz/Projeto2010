In the absence of a significant peace process and against the backdrop of Fateh's failure to maintain an effective ruling authority and sound government, Hamas defeated Fateh in parliamentary elections, formed a Palestinian Authority government and rounded out its victory with a military takeover of the Gaza Strip. Israel responded by galvanizing an international consensus in favor of boycotting Hamas and recognizing the Fayyad government. It followed through politically with the goal of bringing about the collapse of Hamas rule in Gaza and constraining its military expansion and the threat it projects to the surrounding towns and kibbutzim. Hence it limited and even ceased the passage of goods into the Strip and encouraged reinforcement of the Egyptian military deployment along the philadelphi strip in order to prevent smuggling.

This is the political backdrop to the Israel-Hamas military struggle. Israel is deploying its military in a series of operations defined by two basic political assumptions. In view of the cost involved and particularly considering the absence of an actor, new or old, to whom it can transfer responsibility, it is avoiding full reoccupation of the Strip. But it is also avoiding accepting a ceasefire along the conditions proffered by Hamas. This reflects its fear of aggrandizing Hamas' prestige and of facilitating Hamas' military growth, stabilization of its rule in Gaza, enhancement of its status in the West Bank and damage to Fateh's status--to the extent of the latter's collapse and cancellation of the international boycott of Hamas rule.

This operational policy has for the past two years nourished an asymmetrical struggle. Israel launches daily attacks against armed personnel inside Gaza, bringing about hundreds of casualties every month at a minimal cost to itself. And Hamas strikes at Israeli civilian population concentrations in the Gaza region with rockets and mortars--for which Israel still lacks an effective defensive or offensive response.

The Egyptian-mediated negotiations over a ceasefire are drawn-out because of the different ways the two sides approach their objectives. Hamas sees a ceasefire first and foremost as a way of removing the boycott; it is prepared to reciprocate with delayed implementation in the West Bank. Israel seeks to begin with a mutual ceasefire and wants to prioritize and delay for as long as possible an ending of the Gaza siege and a ceasefire with Hamas in the West Bank. Israel, which enjoys the military advantage, wants to integrate release of captured soldier Gilad Shalit into the deal and pay in return the lowest possible price in released Palestinian prisoners. 

Until agreement is reached, if at all, both sides continue to pursue the military track in an attempt to augment ceasefire conditions. Occasionally they even violate their shared informal "understandings" regarding the use of force: Hamas, by firing Grad rockets at Ashkelon and Netivot inside Israel; the IDF, by launching broader and deeper ground operations than usual.

Recent political and domestic developments are also relevant to ceasefire conditions:


 The "Talansky affair" is understood by the Palestinian public as putting paid to President Mahmoud Abbas' promise to deliver an agreement for the establishment of a Palestinian state by the end of 2008. This failure removes the most significant threat mounted against Hamas, which feared the ceasefire would be exploited by Israel and Fateh to present the Palestinian public with an agreement. It even strengthens Hamas' policy of negotiating under fire--a policy increasingly preferred by Fateh activists and by the general public too, as an unavoidable tool for negotiating not just a Gaza ceasefire but peace as well.
 The electoral campaign anticipated in Israel in the coming months is liable to cause most Israeli political parties to adopt more extreme positions, thereby feeding into Hamas' internal-Palestinian propaganda campaigns.
 The most recent visit to Tehran by Hamas leader Khaled Mishaal, held against the backdrop of the Syrian-Israeli announcement regarding renewal of negotiations, produced an increase of Iranian aid to Hamas to total $250 million a year and a commitment to supply enhanced weaponry.
 With recent statements by Fateh activists in mind, Hamas has of late concentrated on trying to bring about Qatari involvement in mediating between the two movements. PM Ismail Haniyeh visited the offices of the Qatari representative in Gaza, while senior Hamas official Mahmoud al-Zahar held a similar meeting in Doha. This gambit has media and psychological importance in view of the successful Qatari mediation among Lebanese factions that finalized Hizballah's victory over its rivals in Beirut. Similarly, Qatari involvement is likely to mean a Hamas-Fateh dialogue that favors Hamas and to offer a way for Hamas to counter the views of Egypt, which seeks to maintain exclusivity in mediating between both Hamas and Israel and Hamas and the PA leadership.
