Our talk lasted for hours--perhaps the longest conversation we have had in recent years. Toward its conclusion, I asked if he would ever return to politics. He smiled his famous smile and stated--as one stating a simple fact: "Yes! When a successor is needed for Arafat, and only then, I'll be called to serve and have no choice but to accept. I won't lead the Palestinian people for long. My task will be to stabilize the system and hand the torch to the younger generation, those who are 40 today."

The reality of that apartment in Amman and Abbas' surprising self-confidence were a far cry from the external situation and Abbas' image at the time as a political corpse. But he was right. Arafat died, Abbas was summoned to succeed him, won by a large majority and upon his election announced that he would not serve more than a single term of office. Since he was elected, everyone dreads the day he decides to leave office: everyone knows he hates ruling.

Abbas' political future is a personal issue. In a year or two, he will probably return to his family and write books. Our issue is whether it is possible to transform the remainder of his term into a period of substantive change in the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians. My response is that we will be making a terrible mistake if we don't take advantage of the months ahead.

This may be a case of a weak leader. Undoubtedly, what happened of late in Gaza has weakened him even more. He is the president of a ruptured authority, with a parliament in which only a minority supports his party and he can't pass laws and decisions. He is held back by constraints originally intended to reduce Arafat's authority but that now hurt him. 

Yet there can be no doubt that he also embodies considerable power. He heads the PLO, the legitimate representative organization of the Palestinian people, which sits in the United Nations and other international organizations from the Socialist International to cultural and educational bodies. It is with the PLO that we signed the Oslo Accord in 1993 and the Interim Agreement in 1995. The signing of a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel and the PLO will be honored by the entire world and accepted by the Arab League as satisfying the demands of the Arab peace initiative. 

Abbas alone holds this key. No one knows who will succeed him; no one knows whether the future will produce a Palestinian leader as courageous as him, as comprehending of the importance of peace with Israel for the Palestinian national interest and as ready to reach an historic compromise over such sensitive issues as Jerusalem and the refugees.

In addressing Abbas' weaknesses we must ask: weak in what respect? And in addressing the strengthening of Abbas we must also ask: stronger in what respect? Abu Mazen is weak in the sense that the security establishment at his disposal is weak, as was proved in the recent confrontation in the Gaza Strip. But is the right response to send him rifles and train the forces currently loyal to him? Not necessarily. Abbas can only be strengthened in the area where he can demonstrate his power: political negotiations. Only negotiations over final status can bolster his position and enable him to demonstrate to his people that he can "deliver the goods". Only a comprehensive final status agreement with the PLO will generate worldwide acceptance of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, recognition of our eastern border, removal of the refugee issue from our agenda and the safeguarding of a Jewish majority in a democratic Israel.
