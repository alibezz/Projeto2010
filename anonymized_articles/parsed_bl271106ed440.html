Instead, the militant summoned hundreds of his neighbors to form a human shield on the roof and around the house. The IAF canceled its attack. No one in Israel protested.

In the past two weeks, a shady Russian billionaire immigrant to Israel, Arkadi Gaydamak, financed a vacation in Eilat for thousands of beleaguered residents of Sderot who were panicking under an escalated Palestinian rocket attack and despaired of government aid and support. Gaydamak, who has political ambitions, did something similar last summer, setting up a tent city on the beach south of Tel Aviv for thousands of neglected residents of northern Israel under attack from Hizballah katyushas.

Last week, the first cohort of IDF draftees since last summer's war was inducted. Against a backdrop of heavy public criticism of the way the war was conducted by the IDF itself as well as by the civilian leadership, the volunteer rate for special combat units was at record proportions.

And yesterday, the Palestinian Authority announced a ceasefire in Gaza on behalf of all Palestinian factions. It was immediately reciprocated by Israel. If it holds--and judging by experience this is doubtful--it could provide a foundation for a Palestinian unity government and a prisoner exchange that could in turn pave the way for a renewal of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.

What do these events tell us about the role of the Israeli and Palestinian publics in this conflict?

First of all, despite (or alongside) significant public dissatisfaction and protest on both sides, both the Israeli and the Palestinian civilian populations remain intensely patriotic, with Palestinians risking their lives in Gaza to save a house and Israeli youth rallying to the flag at induction time.

Second, despite the hawkish ranting of politicians like Minister of Strategic Threats Avigdor Lieberman, most Israelis support their armed forces' self-imposed humanitarian constraints regarding attacks on civilians--even when Palestinian civilians exploit them to "rescue" a legitimate military target. And, despite accidental deaths such as at Beit Hanoun a few weeks ago, most Palestinians believe Israel is serious about its constraints, otherwise they would not have rushed to protect a house against attack.

Third, despite their pitifully low approval ratings, demonstrated incompetence at Sderot, in northern Israel and elsewhere and inability to get along with one another, PM Ehud Olmert and Defense Minister Amir Peretz were able to withstand public pressure to "do something" about the Qassam rockets from Gaza--meaning, essentially, either launch a major offensive or declare a unilateral ceasefire--and ended up with a ceasefire declaration from the Palestinians. And despite the heroic behavior of the Palestinian public, even the hardline Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal apparently felt obliged by Palestinian suffering to come to Cairo, begin seriously negotiating a prisoner exchange and approve a ceasefire. Perhaps the writing was on the wall when the families of the Palestinian victims of the recent Beit Hanoun disaster told the media they preferred a ceasefire to vengeance.

(Then, too, the ceasefire may have no connection at all to public pressure. The real catalyst may have been Syria's willingness to let Meshaal come to Cairo and make the deal--by way of signaling Damascus' desire to placate Washington.)

Both publics have been suffering for years--Palestinians, undoubtedly, far more than Israelis. Both have broadly respected the rule of law within their own societies, with Israeli protests over last summer's war channeled toward demonstrations that produced a host of investigations and two initial resignations, and Palestinians in Gaza stepping back from civil war and persevering in internal political negotiations. 

Yet none of this brings us appreciably closer to ending the conflict. Palestinians last January elected Hamas, which rejects a negotiated two-state solution, and they generally continue to support terrorism against Israelis. Israel's government is too weak to continue even dismantling settlements unilaterally, is unable to find a viable partner for a peace process and is increasingly preoccupied with the threat posed by Iran and its allies rather than with the Palestinians.
