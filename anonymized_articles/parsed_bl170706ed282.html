However, the suffering of the 1.4 million residents of the Gaza Strip continues and even worsens. There is no question that Israel has the right to defend its sovereign territory from attacks. The Palestinian Authority has been patently delinquent in its obligation to stop the firing of Qassam rockets and other targeting of Israeli civilians--acts that are defined as war crimes. Israel has no choice but to take measures to protect its civilians. However, legitimate ends must only be pursued with legitimate means.  

International Humanitarian Law (the laws of war) provides the main legal framework for Israel's current operation in Gaza. Two central pillars of this body of law are the principle of distinction (the obligation to only attack military targets, never civilian targets) and the principle of proportionality (the prohibition on attacking legitimate military targets if it will cause excessive harm to civilians). Several Israeli actions over the past month indicate a blatant disregard for both of these principles. 

Since the beginning of June, 126 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip, 65 of them civilians who took no part in the fighting. Hundreds more have been seriously, even permanently, injured. Israeli air strikes against Palestinian militants are responsible for many of these casualties. Even if we accept Israel's explanation that those targeted constitute legitimate military targets, the harm to civilians in many cases appears blatantly excessive. Just last week, for example, Israel killed nine members of a single family, including seven children, in the bombing of a hideout of senior Hamas activists. 

However, the suffering of the civilian population is not merely a byproduct of Israel's attacks against militants. It is an intentional part of Israeli policy. Consider, for example, the low-altitude sorties of the Israel Air Force over the Gaza Strip, three to four times each night, in order to cause powerful sonic booms. There is no military benefit to these flights; their sole purpose was explained by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert: "Thousands of residents in southern Israel live in fear and discomfort, so I gave instructions that nobody will sleep at night in Gaza." The clear intention of the practice is to pressure the Palestinian Authority and the armed Palestinian organizations by harming the entire civilian population. It is a form of collective punishment, which is blatantly illegal. While it is true that the sonic booms do not kill anyone, they cannot be dismissed as merely an annoyance. Gaza children, in particular, suffer from the panic and anxiety these booms cause; their trauma manifests in loss of concentration, loss of appetite, bedwetting, and other disorders. 

Israel has also intentionally destroyed civilian infrastructure, such as the bridges linking the southern and northern portions of the Gaza Strip, and even more devastating, the central electricity relay station bombed on June 28. It is estimated that it will take months to repair the damage, and in the meantime Gazans have electricity for only some six hours each day. This increases the need for fuel and spare parts to power generators (particularly for hospitals and water pumping stations), as well as dependence on the daily import of perishables like milk that can no longer be refrigerated. All of these goods must come through Israel, primarily through the Karni crossing, which Israel closed for most of the recent period.

Reports from Gaza are dire. Stores have stopped selling meat and dairy products. Trucks of food and medicine have been stuck at Karni. Several water wells are no longer functioning. Hospitals have reduced their activities to life-saving procedures. The water utility has been dumping raw sewage into the sea for lack of power and equipment to run the sewage treatment plants. There is concern that untreated sewage will pollute the aquifer or spill into the streets causing a public health disaster.
