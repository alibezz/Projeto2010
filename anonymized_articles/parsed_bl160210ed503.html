Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) is clear in his objections to anything except final status, but he has preconditions. Binyamin Netanyahu wants final status negotiations but without prior conditions. If and when that gap is bridged and negotiations begin, the wider gap, on core issues, will be revealed.

Though the Palestinian side may agree to the Clinton proposals of 2000 that divide sovereignty over the suburbs of Jerusalem on an ethnic basis (what is Jewish is Israeli and what is Arab is Palestinian), the two sides will most probably be unable to decide on the future of the part of Jerusalem inside and just outside the walls. In the past, prime ministers Barak and Olmert went far beyond the Israeli consensus by agreeing to divide sovereignty even within the city walls, but no final agreement was reached. Whether such a proposal would have passed the political hurdles of a Knesset vote (one at least would be needed to undo the laws concerning Jerusalem that have been adopted since 1967) and a referendum, Netanyahu and most of his current ministers are unlikely to accept such a compromise.

The same can be said about Palestinian refugees. Past Israeli negotiators were willing to accept a return of up to 75,000. But Netanyahu does not recognize the very principle of return, and even if the relatively moderate Kadima party were to join the government this would not increase support for compromise on the issue.

The third core issue, the borders outside Jerusalem, is unlikely to produce a greater degree of compromise, though here the current Israeli government may be able to show greater flexibility.

In other issues that relate to the attributes of Palestinian sovereignty, further unbridgeable gaps may be exposed. These include the degree to which the future Palestinian government controls the entry points into its territory, its airspace and electro-magnetic space.

The political on top of geographic separation between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank further complicates matters. What is Abu Mazen's validity as a negotiator on behalf of the Palestinians and what is the likelihood of Hamas accepting the results of his negotiations? To the extent that there was an initial element of flexibility in his negotiating tactics, this has been eliminated by the need to prove to the Palestinian camp that he is not yielding any ground to Israel.

So the question begs itself--if the final outcome of final status negotiations is pre-determined, why are the Israeli and Palestinian leaders so keen on opening them, beyond the possibility that both are bluffing and seek to pin the blame for failure to launch the talks on the other side?

The Palestinian side is also reluctant to embark on an incremental, bottom-up approach as it suspects that the Israeli government really wishes to reduce international pressure, mostly from the US administration, by making the fewest possible concessions. The Palestinian side, though not completely averse to getting more territory in the West Bank, wishes to link any partial step to a very clear action plan for the attainment of the establishment of a Palestinian state.  In Abu Mazen's view, the Palestinian side carried out its phase I obligations under the 2003 roadmap, hence what is to be discussed is the Palestinian statehood phase. The Palestinian side points to its achievements in building internal security organs and fighting terror organizations and to the famous Salam Fayyad plan for state institution-building during the next 18 months.

Netanyahu's calls for permanent status negotiations result from a different logic. This is his second term and most probably his last chance of leaving his mark in Israel's history books. Secondly, the Palestinians won't trade the only card they hold--end of conflict--for a partial step, while Netanyahu wants an end of conflict agreement. But here is the paradox: not only will Netanyahu not pay the price asked by the Palestinians but his definition of end of conflict differs from that of the Palestinians and from the one offered in the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. He has repeated this demand several times, including in his Bar Ilan speech. Netanyahu wants the Palestinians to recognize Israel as the Jewish state. Abu Mazen rejects this demand, saying that what happens behind final borders once they are agreed upon is Israel's business to define for itself. Netanyahu and those supporting his demand say that the Palestinian definition of end of conflict is not necessarily the end of all claims that Palestinians harbor in their minds and souls, hence the request to the Arab side to accept his definition.

What, therefore, is the political logic of launching permanent status negotiations against the odds and given that all previous attempts failed?  Both the Palestinian government and the US administration may take courage from the fact that every round in the past shortened the distance to the Israeli goalpost. 

The Oslo accords produced Israel's recognition that it will be separated from the West Bank and that it will have to negotiate, among other issues, Jerusalem and the Palestinian refugees. Camp David 2000 saw the introduction into the Israeli public discourse of the possibility of dividing Jerusalem and the removal of some of the settlements and the idea of a swap between territory in the West Bank and territory in Israel within the 1967 lines. Even if the next round does not produce results, according to this view, a further softening of Israeli public opinion may occur. 

This view is certainly supported by the far-reaching concessions that Olmert, the former hawkish mayor of Jerusalem, was willing to make as prime minister during his negotiations with Abu Mazen during 2008. When, in 2000, I spoke to Mayor Olmert, he rejected the slightest concession in Jerusalem. In 2008 he agreed, according to his own account of the talks with Abu Mazen, to share control of the inner parts of Jerusalem with other states, mostly Arab.

From the US point of view, the deeper the talks touch the core issues of borders, Jerusalem and refugees the greater the prospect of the Netanyahu government changing it composition, with Kadima joining at the expense of FM Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beitenu party, possibly Shas and certainly the smaller far-right parties.
