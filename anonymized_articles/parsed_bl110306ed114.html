It does not accept Israel, has rejected the Oslo Accords on which rests the international legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority, and its ideology views all of Palestine, "from the river to the sea", as an inalienable waqf. It has educated scores of its younger adherents to carry out suicide attacks against civilian targets in Israel and has glorified them as martyrs.

Moreover, its charter is tinged with nasty whiffs of anti-Semitism, straight from the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. According to Article 22 of the charter, the Jews have been responsible for all the convulsions in the world, from the French to the Communist revolution; they instigated World War I so as to dismantle the Ottoman Caliphate, and were responsible for World War II, through which "they reaped enormous profits"; they set up such nefarious institutions as the League of Nations and the United Nations, which they use in order to rule the world; in these efforts they are assisted by such subversive organizations as the Freemasons, Rotary and the Lions' Club.

To imagine that an organization that holds such views would--as demanded by the international community as well as Israel--recognize Israel's right to exist, refrain from terror and accept all previous agreements signed by the Palestinian Authority, is sheer hallucination. 

Yet the Hamas electoral victory does not necessarily mean that things have to go from bad to worse. First of all, one has to recognize that Hamas' victory represents not only a revulsion against the endemic corruption of the PA and Fateh: it goes much deeper. With its numerous and competing security services, numbering more than 55,000 armed men, the PA has become another mukhabarat state, at the same time failing the minimal conditions for state-building: the monopoly of the legitimate use of force. Not yet a state, the PA has already become a failed state, and by rejecting Fateh, Palestinians have registered their dismay at the failure of their historic leadership to achieve even the minimal conditions for statehood.

While Hamas is unlikely to change its declaratory policies vis-a-vis Israel, so deeply anchored in its core ideological premises, the practical behavior of a Hamas-led government may be a different matter.

Assuming--though this is not yet guaranteed--that there is a smooth transfer of power in the PA, a Hamas-led government's first aim will be to stay in power. This will not be achieved by reverting to violence, terrorism and suicide bombing, as such a policy will immediately provoke massive Israeli retaliatory steps, which could very easily bring down the entire structure of the PA. Nor would such a violent policy help Hamas achieve the kind of international legitimacy toward which it is striving.

Hence it is quite possible that, while continuing to stick to its total ideological rejection of Israel, Hamas may aim at showing that it can run a clean, efficient administration. This can be achieved only if relations with Israel do not escalate. Hamas may thus have both the interest and the will to curb terrorist attacks against Israel. Hamas in government may behave very similarly to the way Hizballah has behaved since the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon: rhetorically violent, practically careful and pragmatic.

Since the failure of Camp David 2000, there has been a marked shift in Israeli public opinion away from a belief in the possibility of a negotiated settlement in the immediate future: this signifies a shift from conflict resolution to conflict management, as is the case in Bosnia, Kosovo, Cyprus and Kashmir.

The construction of the fence--an evolving de facto border--and the unilateral disengagement from Gaza were clear signs of this shift. Sharon's departure from the Likud and the emergence of Kadima, even in his absence, as the major force in Israeli politics, are further indications in this direction. Few Israelis believed that even had Abu Mazen and Fateh emerged victorious in the recent Palestinian elections, there were chances for meaningful negotiations in the immediate future.

As Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert now indicates clearly, the policy of his government if he wins the March 28 elections would be a set of further major unilateral disengagements in the West Bank, more or less delineating the future borders of Israel if and when negotiations resume in the future. The Hamas victory only strengthens the voices in Israel viewing further unilateral steps as the only game in town.
