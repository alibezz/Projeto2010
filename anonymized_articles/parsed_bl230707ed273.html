Bush's "visionary" speech of June 24, 2002 in which he laid out his commitment to Palestinian statehood, and its pale sequel of last Monday. Five years ago, Bush stood in the Rose Garden surrounded by the top officials of his first administration. His much-anticipated speech topped the White House agenda of the day. This time, it was the fourth and last item on the daily list of presidential events, even below the personnel announcement. The president appeared all by himself, and his aides chose an uninspiring, deliberately noncommittal headline for his speech--"President Bush discusses the Middle East"--as if he were an analyst, rather than the world's leader charting a course of action. 

The message is clear: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a sideshow. Bush went through the motions but failed to show resolve. In the speech, which emerged from a last-minute decision, Bush did not repeat his post-reelection pledge to "spend the capital of the United States" to establish a Palestinian state during his second term in office. His overall message, however, remains unchanged since 2002. Now, as then, he puts the famous "ball" firmly in the Palestinian court. Five years ago he called for a new Palestinian leadership, aiming to push Yasser Arafat aside. The contemporary version presents the Palestinians with "a moment of choice" between Hamas and the moderates, Mahmoud Abbas and Washington's darling, Salam Fayyad. If the Palestinians behave themselves, support the moderates and root out terrorism and corruption, they will get their coveted state in the West Bank and Gaza. 

From the perspective of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the Bush speech could hardly be more convenient. It might as well have been drafted at the prime minister's office in Jerusalem. Olmert's stated policy calls for an Israeli withdrawal from most West Bank territory in order to preserve Israel's Jewish majority under the strain of demography. The mild demands made by Bush on the Israeli side--outpost removal and a settlement freeze--coincide with Olmert's own statements, although he has yet to deliver on them. Both Bush and Olmert have spun the Hamas takeover of Gaza in June as a great opportunity to bolster Abbas. Olmert has followed up with gestures like releasing tax revenues, freeing Palestinian prisoners and resuming security cooperation in the West Bank. 

Bush's harsh tone against Hamas, tougher than Israeli statements, frees Olmert from the dilemma of dealing with the new rulers of Gaza. At least for now, it shields Olmert from efforts by Arab and European governments to include Hamas in the political process and encourage Palestinian unity. Even regarding the Arab peace initiative, Bush sufficed with calling it "a welcome first step" rather than asking Israel to accept it as the basis for negotiations. Bush accepted Abbas' demand to move directly to final status negotiations, skipping the optional second stage of the roadmap that suggests a Palestinian state within provisional borders. But here, too, Olmert--who balks at discussing final borders, Jerusalem, or the refugees--has nothing to worry about. Abbas and Co. must fight terror in earnest before the United States gives a green light to final status talks. 

These points, important as they are, were meant mostly for peace process buffs. The real game is in the Israeli domestic arena. There Olmert, unpopular and widely criticized for his conduct during last summers' Second Lebanon War, is preoccupied with keeping his job. American support and diplomatic moves are well-practiced recipes for political survival in Israel, as Ariel Sharon showed with his Gaza disengagement. Bush's speech gives Olmert both. Once again, the president lent Olmert a helping hand, tailored his policy to Olmert's political capabilities and restrained the activism of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. To this, Bush added a small prize, namely the convening of "an international meeting" in the fall to promote Palestinian statehood.

The meeting's proposed timeline coincided with the anticipated release of the Winograd commission's final report, widely expected to castigate Olmert for his war leadership failures and possibly call for his ouster. But if the prime minister is busy peacemaking, the commission might hesitate to force his resignation. Moreover, Ehud Barak's Labor party will never leave the coalition on the eve of a diplomatic breakthrough, even after a tough Winograd report. Barak will have to renege on his previous somewhat ambiguous pledge and explain that the future is more important than settling past scores. Moreover, the international meeting preparations will keep the diplomatic arena busy and raise speculation--and Israeli headlines--over possible Saudi participation (which currently appears highly unlikely.)

Last Wednesday, two days after the Bush speech, Olmert received more good news when the Winograd commission indicated a further delay of its report. This prompted him to issue an unprecedented bid for reelection and to declare that Abbas, while not ideal, is the best Palestinian partner that Israel could have at this point in time. "We will have to make tough decisions to preserve the Jewish character of the state," Olmert told a group of veteran kibbutzniks, hinting at a negotiated West Bank withdrawal.
