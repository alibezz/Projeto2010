The War of Independence enabled the founding of the state. In a bloody struggle and at a very heavy human and economic price, Israel succeeded in thwarting the attempt to prevent implementation of the United Nations decision from November 29, 1947 that established it. The Six-Day War created the conditions for Arab acquiescence in Israel's existence and in the need to reach diplomatic agreements with it.

The Six-Day War surprised us; we had not expected war in 1967. Nevertheless, we always knew that a new war with the surrounding Arab states was inevitable. We knew the Arab states had not come to terms with the outcome of the 1948 war, that they would not suffice with an armistice regime and that they were preparing for war. The Arab summit decided to establish a united Arab command precisely for this purpose; it decided to divert the waters of the Hatzbani and the Banias rivers, thereby dooming the recently completed national water carrier in Israel that would carry water from the Sea of Galilee to the Negev; and it decided to establish the Palestine Liberation Organization under Ahmed Shukairy. The surprise of 1967 was the timing, but not the war and preceding crisis in and of themselves. 

Much has been said regarding Israel's decisive and phenomenal military victory. In June 1967, in the course of six days of combat, Israel defeated the armies of Egypt, Jordan and Syria. But in historical perspective, the three weeks of waiting prior to the decision to launch a war were of no less significance. Those three weeks laid the political groundwork both for the war itself and for Israel's demand to hold onto the territories it had captured as bargaining cards, pending peace agreements with its neighbors.

It was this international support that prevented pressure on Israel to withdraw immediately to the June 4 lines and that contributed to UN Security Council Resolution 242, which speaks of Israeli withdrawal from "territories" it had occupied and not from "all the territories". On June 19, 1967, ten days after the war ended, the government of Israel decided to offer Cairo and Damascus an Israeli withdrawal to the borders of Mandatory Palestine in return for comprehensive peace agreements. Egypt and Syria rejected this appeal and replied, at the Khartoum Arab summit, with three nos: no to peace, no to recognition and no to negotiations with Israel.

Nevertheless, ten years later and four years after the Yom Kippur War, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat arrived in Jerusalem and declared "no more war". There and then began the process of Arab recognition and acceptance of Israel.

In order for Israel's Arab neighbors to recognize and accept Israel's existence--from their standpoint, a bitter pill to swallow--three conditions had to be fulfilled. They had to be completely convinced that they could not bring about Israel's destruction through military means; they had to recognize that international political reality would not serve the Arab interest and compel Israel to withdraw; and there had to be a degree of urgency impelling any Arab country, each for its own reasons, to accept a diplomatic settlement rather than postponing a solution to the unforeseeable future.

First, then, was Egypt. We recall that the Yom Kippur War, for which Egypt had prepared during more than six years and which opened, from its standpoint, with total military surprise, concluded with IDF forces positioned 100 km. from Cairo, deep inside Egyptian territory, and besieging the Third Army, half of Egypt's land force. During the ensuing four years, Egypt tried in vain to drive a wedge between Israel and the United States and dilute American diplomatic support for Israel. It was then that the regime in Cairo came under unbearable domestic socio-economic pressures, to the extent that Sadat felt compelled to look for an instant solution in the form of recognition of Israel.

Second was Jordan, which went through a similar military, political and domestic process. But Jordan could not allow itself to engage publicly in a peace agreement with Israel. It had to wait until the Oslo accords awarded it Palestinian "legitimacy".

Third was the PLO. Thirty years of struggle and terrorism ended from its standpoint in total failure inside the Israeli-occupied territories, in a bloody "Black September" confrontation in Jordan and in the First Lebanon War, which led to the PLO's departure to exile in Tunis. It then took fatigue from the first intifada and political isolation after the first Gulf war to lay the groundwork for the Oslo talks and agreement.

Lately we see the president of Syria undergoing a similar evolution in Damascus. Heavy political, economic and social dilemmas are causing him to invite Israel to sit and negotiate.

Finally, there is the Arab peace initiative, offering Israel peace with all Arab countries, albeit under opening conditions that will require prolonged and tough negotiations.

Thus far the Arab side. But it takes two to tango. The peace process cannot advance without the full cooperation of the Israeli side. The Israeli public has tired of war and seeks a political solution. Israelis aspire to a solution of the Palestinian issue based on two states, side by side. They well understand the price of comprehensive peace: the Golan Heights and removal of most of the West Bank settlements. They know that an agreed final border will be drawn on the basis of the historic green line, and they accept this.

Those who are not ready are the Israeli and Palestinian political systems. Both here and there, the governments are weak, unstable and incapable of making the necessary decisions.
