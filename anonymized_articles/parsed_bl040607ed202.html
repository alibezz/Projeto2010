For sure, not all the developments on the Israeli-Arab scene have been a direct outcome of what happened in 1967, but insofar as Palestinian-Israeli relations are concerned it is safe to say that Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza has not ceased to constitute the main factor in shaping their evolution as well as the internal dynamics of both polities. If this is the case, it is meaningful to draw a Palestinian-Israeli balance sheet of 40 years of occupation. 

On the Palestinian side, the war took place at a time when Palestinian identity was witnessing a revival that had started in the early 1960s among the new elites in Lebanese and Syrian refugee camps and in the Gulf. This renewed identity, a reaction to failed Arab unity endeavors, bore several fruits, among them ideas of self-reliance, armed struggle to return to the homeland, inter-Palestinian networking and self-organization. Thus the shock provoked by both the Arab armies' defeat and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza did not create or recreate Palestinian identity. It did provide a major impetus to this identity's embodiment in a political movement endowed with mobilized popular support and an autonomous decision-making capacity in relation to Arab states. It was thanks to this capacity that the post-1967 PLO leadership could conceive its own program and adopt the idea of statehood, first in the form of a single democratic state for both Arabs and Jews over the whole of British Mandate Palestine (1968-69), then in the form of a Palestinian state limited to the occupied West Bank and Gaza (since 1974). 

It is thus not an exaggeration to say that the 1967 war launched a chain reaction within which the Palestinians solidified their political autonomy and at the same time, paradoxically, reconciled themselves with the idea of dividing their original homeland into an Israeli state and a Palestinian state living side by side. However, it is important and fair to add that the kind of legitimacy accorded to Israel in this process was not and could not be a "historical" legitimacy, but an "acquired" legal legitimacy, due to the passage of time, the balance of power and the hope that at least partial justice could be restored. 

On the Israeli side, the overwhelming power of the armed forces and the easy occupation of the West Bank and (less so) of Gaza in the aftermath of the war brought with them a false sense of the success of unilateralism. Israel counted on time to both conquer the land and obtain international legitimacy for its conquest. Today, it is possible to say that it has succeeded meaningfully on the first level, by settling the West Bank, including the Greater Jerusalem area. On the second level, Israeli achievement is mitigated: it has not gained international legal support for its expansion beyond the June 4 lines, but it has benefited and continues to benefit from the permissiveness of western countries for whom international law is to be applied only when it fits their own compelling interest. 

However, the Israeli policy of conquering the land and at the same time gradually tightening its control over the West Bank and Gaza populations led to the first intifada and made the Palestinians "ungovernable". In turn, this led to Israel concluding that it was no longer possible to exert direct control over Palestinian urban centers and refugee camps. Thus a common ground with the PLO's statehood strategy was found: an interim arrangement lasting five years during which the PLO exercised territorial control over the so-called areas A and functional control over areas B while Israel kept its options open in areas C, over main roads and in East Jerusalem. Meanwhile, the PLO recognized the state of Israel and Israel recognized the PLO as representing the Palestinian people.

In hindsight, this imbalanced interim arrangement agreed in Oslo could only have succeeded if the post-1967 policy of conquest of the land had been reversed. By continuing their settlement activities after Oslo, successive Israeli governments cause both peoples to lose a golden opportunity for closing not only the 1967 file, but also that of 1947-48. 

In terms of Israeli-Palestinian relations today, the balance sheet is bleak: there is an Israeli government that has lost its sense of direction, except in blindly pursuing settlement activity; Fateh-PLO is on the brink of losing its decision-making capacity and its control over the Palestinian polity; there are continued violent confrontations between the occupier and a meaningful sector of the occupied; the security of Israel has been expanded to include the security of the settlements; strangulating walls and roadblocks have been built within the territories seized in 1967.
