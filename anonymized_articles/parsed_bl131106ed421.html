The travesty can also be seen in a wider political context. Israel is repeating in Gaza the strategy it deployed in Lebanon. That strategy is simple: if military operations alone are not enough to secure military objectives they will at least inflict serious suffering on the population at large. In Lebanon and in Gaza, Israel is neither able to retrieve its captured soldiers nor prevent the activities of the other side, so Israel makes the other public pay a heavy price. 

The stalemate at the political level is thus now complemented by a complete failure on the ground. Israel is neither able to pursue a political strategy such as the one Ariel Sharon was pursuing--which maintained internal stability and international, or at least American, understanding and support--nor is it able to deal with the situation on the ground in a way consistent with its interests, especially regarding security. 

In other words, the Israeli government, having had to shed its sole political policy on the Palestinian front, the "convergence" strategy, and, as evidenced by Beit Hanoun, pursuing a failed military strategy, is struggling for survival. 

Two options are available to Ehud Olmert's government. One is to pursue a political process with the traditional Palestinian peace camp, led by Mahmoud Abbas. This can be done either through the roadmap approach of a phased interim/final process, or on a lower level of confidence-building measures of a kind that might ease tensions between the two sides and within the internal Palestinian political scene. It would also empower this camp at the expense of Hamas. That might, among other effects, provoke Hamas into escalation. 

The second possible approach is to explore the possibilities of opening negotiations with Hamas and likeminded forces within Palestinian politics on the basis of the long-term ceasefire (hudna) that Hamas seems to be seriously promoting. While that will marginalize the traditional peace camp and empower Hamas internally, it should nevertheless cool Hamas and may reduce tensions with Israel. 

This approach appears to be under serious American and Israeli examination at the moment. It fits well into the second phase of the roadmap, which calls for a Palestinian state with temporary borders. The original concept of the peace process was the exchange of land for peace, and the interim phase of that approach was to give the Palestinian side limited autonomy in order to create the confidence necessary for final negotiations. This new approach seems also to be composed of two phases, but the first phase is a state minus in return for peace minus. 

The killing of innocent civilians in Beit Hanoun also came on the eve of an important visit by Olmert to Washington. Both the Israeli prime minister and the American president are facing hugely adverse internal political conditions. In both cases, the two have in the past relied absolutely on the use of force to deal with their respective problems. 

But continuing the Beit Hanoun strategy will, in addition to the human cost, exact a heavy political price. Such unrestrained use of force will only take away any political horizon and any remaining hope of a political settlement. That in turn only feeds hostility, hatred and extremism, both in Israel and Palestine. 

It is about time that the Israeli public and leadership realized that the change in Palestinian public opinion and the resulting change in the make-up of parliament and government are a direct outcome of Sharon's strategy to ignore the other side except as a target for the army.
