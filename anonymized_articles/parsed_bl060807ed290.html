America is nearing presidential elections, leaving little room for the administration to maneuver on such critical issues as the Middle East. In Israel, the government coalition remains unstable, with the Winograd ciomission's findings on the war in Lebanon liable to jump out at any time to force an early vote. On the Palestinian side, meanwhile, the president has already called for early elections.

The casualty in all this is the peace effort. The election atmosphere, especially in Israel and Palestine, usually brings to the surface the most extreme politics and thus is the least conducive to compromises.

On the Palestinian side there are different opinions about the seriousness of President Mahmoud Abbas' call for elections. Some believe the call is simply a tactic to prolong the life of the present government, which followed the emergency government installed after Hamas' violent takeover of the Gaza Strip in June. 

According to the Palestinian constitution, the president can declare a state of emergency for no longer than a month after which he has to either get a vote of confidence from parliament for the emergency government or hold elections. With Hamas holding a clear majority in the Legislative Council, no such vote of confidence is likely to be forthcoming. 

Complicating the situation further, some 30 of the PLC's 132 members are in Israeli jail, making it harder for it to convene. And although those imprisoned come from all the factions, most famous among them Fateh leader Marwan Barghouti, the vast majority of imprisoned PLC members hail from Hamas. Hamas is therefore not guaranteed a majority should the parliament convene and, with no consensus between the two big parties as there was over the unity government, will be unlikely to allow parliament to reach quorum. With no quorum there can be no vote of confidence in the present government.

At the same time, Hamas does not support early elections. The Islamist movement still considers the unity government the legitimate government and considers early elections a tactic on the part of Abbas to circumvent this legitimacy. With Hamas in control of the Gaza Strip, the general security chaos and lack of control by the Palestinian Authority, it is thus highly unlikely that early elections can be held. And if they were to be held in spite of Hamas objections, they would likely be so only in the West Bank, undermining the fragile unity between the two parts of occupied Palestinian territory, a division no one wants to be perceived to have exacerbated. 

In other words, the Palestinian side is likely to witness no change to the current de facto division between the West Bank and Gaza, especially since this division is politically and for security purposes very convenient for Israel, which ultimately calls the shots.
