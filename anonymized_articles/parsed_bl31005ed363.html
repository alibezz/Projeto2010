It is obvious why large sectors of the public are less troubled today than three or four years ago, when traveling in a bus was akin to a game of Russian roulette. Yet paradoxically, many appear to be less concerned now than when it looked like peace was about to break out, and they would have had to undergo the kind of serious mental switch that becomes necessary when your enemy suddenly becomes your partner.

In fact, the thesis presented here holds that, in a familiar pattern, the outbreak of the intifada was almost a “corrective experience” for many in Israel, insofar as in their perspective the world once again behaved as expected--the Palestinians were attacking and the Jews were fighting back. 

The Israeli Jewish public has a complete, tried-and-true repertoire of practical and emotional tools for dealing with such circumstances. But not for dealing with a situation in which the external threat has disappeared. When the Oslo process was proceeding apace, many Israelis experienced a troublesome sense of distress, as if the sun had begun to set in the morning and rise at night. The public, which had not been prepared at all by the leadership for the strategic departure of 1993, was powerless to deal with the change. Memories of the first intifada were still fresh, along with images of the blows from the Gulf war and Palestinians dancing on the roofs in support of Saddam Hussein. Participation at the Madrid Conference in late 1991 was understood as bowing to American pressure, and the ensuing Washington talks did not look particularly promising. 

Then one fine morning, the public was informed that a declaration of principles was about to be signed with the Palestinians, “cooked” by figures whom many did not trust, with “Mr. Security”, Yitzhak Rabin, signaling with his body language on the White House lawn that he had seemingly been dragged into the deal against his will. Not only did most opponents of the process not believe in its chances of success; even its most dedicated supporters were not thoroughly convinced.

The brutal terrorist events of April 1994 and early 1996 cast further doubt on the logic of continued “peace talks”. The Netanyahu years, managed under the slogan “if they produce [security], they’ll receive [concessions]; if they don’t produce, they won’t receive”, were easier for the public to digest, since they demonstrated a tough and “unfriendly” approach, to the extent that even the Hebron agreement was “swallowed” relatively smoothly.

The election in 1999 of Ehud Barak--whose campaign appeals, we recall, included photos of him as commander of the operation to retake the hijacked Sabena aircraft, his foot planted on the head of a dead Palestinian terrorist--presaged a readiness on the part of the public to “give peace a chance”, while maintaining the broadest possible margin of security. The public’s faith in the process began to erode within months after Barak’s election, so that the “there is no partner” spin following his return empty-handed from Camp David in the summer of 2000, having “offered everything and been turned down”, struck a familiar note. So, too, did the explanation for the intifada that erupted shortly thereafter: that this was the Palestinian leadership’s clever way of obtaining what it had failed to gain through negotiations.

Accordingly, the outbreak of the intifada five years ago was hardly an “earthquake”; rather, it confirmed the most deeply-held concepts and beliefs of the Israeli public regarding the murderous nature of the other side, with the ensuing suicide bombings merely strengthening this image. For many who, during the Oslo years, had been torn between support for the idea and ongoing skepticism regarding Palestinian intentions, the intifada resolved a cognitive dissonance and pushed them to the hawkish right. 

True, even in the darkest days of the intifada about half the public--more at certain times--supported a return to the negotiating table. But all surveys also showed a majority conditioning such a move on an end to terrorism. This effectively neutralized support for negotiations, insofar as it created a circular chicken-and-egg process. Add to this the free hand the public gave its leaders and the IDF to act against the Palestinians as they saw fit (the exception being public opposition to assassinating Yasser Arafat, though only because of practical considerations regarding the consequences for Israel’s international image) and its sustained strong support for building the separation fence, and it looks like the intifada was well suited to the public’s fundamental cognitive mindset.
