"The East has it's own ways of swallowing men with their dreams." This phrase originally summarized the vanity of Alexander the Great's "life project". Two thousand five hundred years later the East is invaded again, neither by the Greeks, Romans nor even by lunatic medieval crusaders seeking redemption for their miserable souls. It is being targeted by the mightiest power ever known to this planet. By pushing a few buttons, this modern Caesar can reverse the whole process of Creation. Breastfed with centuries of suppressing its original native Indians, saturated with centuries of slavery, America has now decided to lighten our eastern existence with the flames of blessed "democracy'. In other words: "Pax Americana". 

I can't think of another culture--undemocratic, cynical and savage as it may be--that would name a four ton atom bomb "little boy" and praise it for eliminating 100,000 souls in Hiroshima as "the greatest thing in history" (Harry Truman). "Evil" must have lived in Hiroshima then. It must have had slanted Japanese eyes and "yellowish" skin. It was the "other". That elusive evil has been switching places, names and faces ever since, moving from Moscow and Cuba to Vietnam through every state in the third world that aspired for independence and yet wasn't eager to worship the American god.
But the East seems to have it's own ways of provoking western greed. Once communism started aging and loosing its sex appeal, the Orient was back on the hot list as an ultimate target: dark skin, black turbans and different beliefs. It is an awesome "other". Above all, there are indefinite amounts of oil under the "infidel" feet there.

"Let's get 'em," the Klu Klux Klan instinct roared. 

"Patience! It's not the time yet," diplomacy mumbled.  

Finally, on 9/11 it happened. At last Mr. Democracy could proudly unveil his shiny crusader's helmet and cry out his Invocatia. But wait, he is much more profound and sophisticated this time, making no discrimination between dark, bright, yellow or short. It is a whole "evil axis" against which he is waging his divine war. Armed with the Bible in one hand and incredibly smart "little boys" in the other, he unleashed America's good ol' regional hit man.

Israel, with a quite impressive and unquestionably proven portfolio of destroying native cultures since the second week of Genesis, was the natural candidate to promote and even initiate the "re-planning of the Middle East" process. Well, for the Israelis it's not a big deal, they "re-plan" nations, regions, towns, houses and families on a daily basis following the proverb: " If you can't join them... eliminate them." They too are godly mandated. They know God in a very personal and intimate manner. They contrived Him and in return He chose them. No matter how furious and disappointed He may be by the children of Israel, never will He need a second thought before destroying their rivals, be those the Jebusites, Canaanites, Egyptians, Palestinians, you name it. 

Taking the Bible a bit too seriously, Mr. Democracy and his partners were sometimes tempted to copy God's schemes and sometimes play His role. After all, collective punishment is an ancient divine hobby:  "And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. Thou shalt speak all that I command thee... unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.  And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.  But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments!" (Exodus 7).

Who is this jealous, greedy, cruel, blood thirsty, gentile-hating God of the American crusaders and their Israeli enforcers? 

Who are those willing to fulfil the kinky desires of that god as it is presented by Washington?
