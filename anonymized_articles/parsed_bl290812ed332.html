He will be lauded, as he already has been in some quarters, as a "man of peace" who has made a significant contribution to furthering the prospects of a settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The irony of this, needless to say, is so heavy you could use it to demolish houses. 

The tragedy is that the withdrawal of just 8,000 settlers from a few settlements in five percent of occupied Palestinian territory, that is, about one percent of historical Palestine, should elicit such hysterical hyperbole. It is a measure of how successful Israel has been in deflecting attention from two of the most important issues that need to be tackled for this conflict to be settled. 

In and of itself, the withdrawal from Gaza Strip settlements and military positions is welcome, whatever may come next. It will tangibly ease conditions for Gazans and make life less dangerous and more bearable. But it must not be allowed to deflect attention from the ever-tightening stranglehold Israel is exerting on the West Bank. One only needs to take a brief glimpse at the new "terminal" at Qalandiya to understand what Israel has in mind here. 

If one believes that by acting unilaterally, even if it means giving up on the greater Israel idea, Israel is in any way furthering the prospects of peace, one is delusional. But forget unilateral: the very fact that any negotiations should be held over the status of any part of the West Bank including East Jerusalem is a testament to the weakness of the Palestinian position and the cowardliness of the international community. That the major settlement blocs are already, with a nudge and a wink, implicitly understood to belong to Israel is a travesty. 

But there is more. Yes, the illegal Jewish settlements in Palestinian territory occupied in 1967 are a major obstacle to peace. They prevent the emergence of a viable and contiguous state on the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Yes, Israel has made it so difficult to remove these settlements that even evacuating the above mentioned minor Gaza Strip settlements left Palestinian factions scrapping to claim "victory" and the international community lauding a "major step toward peace". 

But a vast majority of Palestinians are refugees. Their homes, their lands and their livelihoods were in what is now considered Israel. The fate of these refugees, while ostensibly and outrageously also something to be negotiated, seems to have been already decided and not with a nudge and a wink. Never mind international law, human rights or simple common decency. It is an even bigger travesty of justice, and it doesn't matter how many times and to how many people it has happened before.
