He would not feel the passage of time. He would immediately identify the members of the Palestinian team and their views, ask himself why the Americans aren't in the room, then survey the Israeli team. The faces of the Israeli negotiators would not be familiar, yet the views they express, their tactics and strategy would identify them immediately as Israelis. It would also become clear that not much had changed since the observer fell asleep eight years ago. In short, the Annapolis process has not advanced Israeli-Palestinian negotiations; rather, it has pushed them backwards in a time tunnel.

Israeli PM Ehud Olmert may have declared that there are no negotiations regarding Jerusalem, but in discussions over territory it has proven impossible to avoid defining the boundaries of the Jerusalem that is not being discussed and the extent of proposed Palestinian sovereignty. In the current Annapolis discussions, Israel has defined Jerusalem in accordance with the path of the security fence approved by the government in 2003. This path is nearly identical to the definition of Jerusalem in a map presented by Israel in 2001 at Taba. In other words, Israel is redefining the borders of Jerusalem. Not only is the 1949-1967 armistice border with Jordan no longer relevant to Israel, neither is the annexation boundary set by Israel in late June 1967. Approximately four out of the nine percent of the West Bank that the security fence seeks to attach to Israel are defined by Israel as "greater Jerusalem".

In the course of the Annapolis talks, Israel has presented ideas that clarify its intentions regarding Jerusalem. First, Israel stated that it sees the path of the fence separating Israel and the West Bank as the future border between two sovereign states. The fence will determine the border for both the West Bank and Jerusalem. Postponement of discussion of "greater Jerusalem" is intended to render it easier for the weak Palestinian leader to swallow this bitter territorial pill. 

Israel is not proposing, however, to freeze the situation in Jerusalem. On the contrary, it is expanding settlements in this area, just as it did during the Oslo period. According to data collected by Peace Now, the volume of tenders for construction in East Jerusalem since the Annapolis negotiations commenced has expanded 38-fold compared to the previous year, while the number of construction plans submitted for approval has risen four-fold. To these figures we must add the energetic activity of Jewish settler organizations purchasing houses and land in Jerusalem's Palestinian neighborhoods in order to prevent repartition of the city along ethnic lines, and the expansion of settlements just beyond the city limits.

Second, as at Camp David II in July 2000, Israel proposes that administration of the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif be in the hands of the Muslim waqf, with a "safe passage" corridor linking the holy places to the Palestinian state. In other words, Israel is not considering granting Palestine sovereignty over the Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem, and the religious administration of Haram al-Sharif will be separated from issues of sovereignty. The state of Palestine will not enjoy full sovereignty over Haram al-Sharif, and Israel also will have some sovereign authority.

Third, Israel proposes establishing an international framework of states that have links to the Old City, that will accompany the negotiations and provide auspices for the eventual agreement. Israel may also be considering integrating these countries into the agreed mechanisms that accompany and define implementation of the agreement. Presumably, Israel does not intend to internationalize East Jerusalem at the expense of Israeli sovereignty. In this sense, the Israeli proposal is intended to recruit international--mainly Arab--legitimacy and support for an arrangement that contradicts the Arab peace initiative approved at every Arab summit since 2002.

The Arab plan seeks to divide Jerusalem along ethnic-national lines: all the Jewish neighborhoods and the Western Wall to Israel, and all the Arab neighborhoods and Haram al-Sharif to Palestine. Israel hopes that, together with the United States, it can bring the weak West Bank government to accept its proposal. This would replace the current situation, in which the Arab and Islamic states line up behind the Palestinians and create a consensus that even Hamas has to accept.
