Voter turnout was the lowest ever in Israel's history. Given the variety of issues and concerns at hand, both internal and external, the results were muddled. A portion voted for unilateral separation while another voted for a continuation of negotiations. Still a third group voted to expel and isolate Palestinians. A fourth sector opted for religion and the Torah. A fifth group voted for pensioners. 

Although Israeli elections have always resulted in a spectrum of programs and lists represented in the Knesset, this time the diversity in the mix was great. Sharon's absence lost seats for Kadima; Netanyahu's presence lost seats for the Likud; Peretz gave the Labor Party hope; the Russians became a political power; the Sephardic religious and racist Shas advanced. Political, economic and various social issues will intertwine in a new Israeli government that will embrace unilateral separation from the Palestinians not because it is the greatest common denominator among the different coalition partners, but because it is the only common denominator. 

To pass judgment on the coming government, we must first wait and see what the make-up of the coalition will be. However we must understand that political trends in Israel are moving right. When the Kadima party is considered centrist, the center is effectively moving right. The significant political consequence of this is that any future dealings with the Palestinians and any political settlement will be more extreme and radical than in the past. Circumstances and the Palestinian elections have also dictated that, at the same time, Hamas sits at the helm of the Palestinian Authority, something that will only encourage the rightward trend in Israel.

Regardless of the make-up of the coalition, we can be certain that the next Israeli government will claim not only that there is no Palestinian partner to revive hopes of a political settlement through negotiations, but that the PA is a terrorist organization and must be isolated. The presence of a Hamas government will make it easier for Ehud Olmert to proceed with his separation plan without negotiations. 

If the Labor party is part of the coalition, it will demand negotiations with the Palestinians, but only to reach a final settlement not much different from what is being proposed in Olmert's unilateral separation plan. The compromise between Kadima and Labor, if the latter does participate in government, may be to open a channel of negotiations with the Palestinian presidency through the PLO. The aim of these "negotiations" is not to negotiate but to convince the Palestinian side of the need to accept the Israeli vision of a unilateral separation. At some stage, these "negotiations" will inevitably collapse and the Israeli government can blame their failure on Palestinian obstinacy.  

No doubt, some parties in this government and the right wing parties outside it will try to aggravate Palestinian sentiments during this "negotiating" period in order to provoke Palestinian bombings inside Israel. If these operations do take place, which they most probably will, the Israeli government will be relieved of the burden of these "negotiations", and Kadima will be given a green light to impose its separation plan.

There will be opposition from right wing circles and the settlers. This opposition will be stronger than it was during the evacuation of Gaza Strip settlements because of the difference in the level of importance of the West Bank to these groups.  

These groups will use all possible methods to prevent the evacuation of settlements in the West Bank and will rely on Palestinian bombings to spread fear in Israeli society. This could either lead to a government collapse or a strengthening of its position. It all depends on the behavior of the Israeli majority at the time and on the positions of international parties, particularly the US administration. 

The Palestinian position, meanwhile, is much hampered by having passed on opportunities that could have proven fruitful in confronting the Israeli separation plan such as the dissolution of the Palestinian Authority, and is at the mercy of Israeli politics. 

Political tension in the Palestinian arena as a result of Hamas' election victory will drive those embracing the strategy of continuous negotiations with Israel to desperate measures to revive the process with the next Israeli government. However, such negotiations, if they should occur, will soon hit the wall of the Israeli separation plan. Given their inability to exert any tangible pressure on the Israeli government, Palestinian negotiators will not be able to achieve any progress. 

On the contrary, the internal Palestinian situation will complicate further because of friction between Fateh and Hamas.Hamas will adopt a wait-and-see approach regarding any political process in order to embroil Fateh in new and futile negotiations with Israel. Then the Palestinian government (if it still exists) will reject the negotiations but without preventing the Israeli government from implementing its separation plan. 

What will prove important for Palestinian affairs in the upcoming stage will not be the consequences of Israel's unilateral separation plan but how the predicaments created by the tensions between Fateh and Hamas, as played out between the presidency and the government and in the PLC and in public institutions will turn out. Everyone in the Palestinian arena will be preoccupied with the burdens of internal tensions and as a result will leave Israel to decide the Palestinian destiny. After that, Palestinians may decide to begin a new intifada.

Unfortunately, Palestinians oscillate between favoring negotiations at times and the intifada at others, and offer no creative alternatives. Confronting the unilateral plans of the Israeli government requires that Palestinians seriously look into the option of dissolving the PA.
