Successive Israeli governments systematically destroyed or weakened moderate Palestinian leaderships, from the destruction of the Palestine National Front in the mid-1970s (the early champions of the two-state solution within the territories) through the total failure to undertake any measures that might have strengthened Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) as prime minister or president in the eyes of his people, all the way to the recent imprisonment of the few Hamas leaders willing to speak with Israel.  

Add to this PM Ariel Sharon's successful effort to weaken and disperse the Palestinian Authority, as well as Israel's undeclared policy of separating Gaza from the West Bank, and we have the situation we are facing today. Fateh obviously carries its share of responsibility for the situation as well, through its own internal divisions, corruption and indecisiveness. Let us not forget, however, the underlying, critical matter: Israel's failure to end the occupation throughout these 40 years of increasing hardship, poverty, disappointment, loss of land and lives and hopelessness for the publics over which Hamas and Fateh are competing.

The question is: can these (and many more) mistakes of the past provide some clues as to how best to proceed for the future? With a rump "government" officially dissolved by the PA president but still presiding over Gaza, a new emergency government appointed by Abu Mazen, a legislative council dominated by Hamas but possibly also dissolved under emergency regulations (if they exist), one security force in Gaza and another one apparently maintaining its supremacy in the West Bank, and opinion seemingly divided within both Hamas and Fateh over policy--there are probably no ideal answers.  

But theoretically, at least, there are a number of options for Israel (and the US and the international community). Among these are a) the introduction of an international force into Gaza (some might add, into the West Bank as well--namely a trusteeship for the territories altogether, concomitant with Israeli withdrawal to at least temporary lines); exclusive reliance upon and strengthening of Abu Mazen coupled with total isolation, boycott and pressure on Gaza; support for efforts to reconstruct the national unity government, including a lifting of the ban on Hamas subject to its demonstrating control over the various Islamic militias in Gaza and concomitant with a strengthening of Abu Mazen; and the opening of negotiations for a comprehensive settlement through the good offices of the Arab League.

The first option of an international force sounds most attractive, relieving both Israel and the Palestinians of responsibility for the Palestinian public. If this included the West Bank it would mean the end of the occupation. But of course, Israel has never shown any interest in this kind of an arrangement, and therefore it is a moot point for the West Bank. 

An international force has been broached by Israel as an option for Gaza now that Hamas is in charge there. But for this very reason, it too is a non-starter: Hamas will not agree to such a limitation on its power, and no international body would be willing to take on such a task under these conditions. Conceivably, the Egyptians might agree to international strengthening of their contingents on the border (Rafah crossing, etc.), but short of an agreement with Hamas or some other body in charge of Gaza, the international community would most likely fear to establish a physical presence.  

The option that has been adopted already by both Israel and the United States (with the rest of the Quartet likely to follow suit) is to strengthen Abu Mazen and isolate Haniyeh. The idea is to provide the means (primarily financial but possibly material as well) for Fateh to demonstrate its value to the Palestinian public at the expense of Hamas. This is to be done by lifting the ban on the PA and releasing the owed Palestinian funds, thereby providing sorely needed salaries for public workers (though it is not clear if these would include civil servants in Gaza). 

But to win over the public, further measures would be necessary. There is talk of lifting some checkpoints and the like to ease the occupation somewhat for West Bank Palestinians, but the most effective "confidence-building measure" to endear Fateh to the public might well be a broad release of prisoners (obviously not including Hamas prisoners). Such a measure could demonstrate that Abu Mazen can "deliver"--mitigating, perhaps, the charges of Fateh "collaboration" with Israel (and the US).  

The major risk in this policy, however, is the acknowledgment and possible institutionalization of the separation of the West Bank from Gaza, namely the three-state idea that would actually sabotage the creation of a Palestinian state and resolution of the conflict with Israel. The gamble would be that Abu Mazen might find a way to bring benefits for the population in Gaza (salaries for civil servants for example) without their being credited to Hamas or easing the task of ruling for Hamas.  Fateh might count on Hamas' inability to rule (as it did after the elections of 2006), but isolation and hardship for the people of Gaza have already proven to benefit rather than harm Hamas vis-a-vis Fateh among Gazans.  

For this reason the third option, resurrecting the national unity government and dealing also with Hamas, may be necessary. This is clearly not an ideal solution for Israel--indeed, it is one the government is most unlikely to support--but it is an option that some in Fateh (and the Arab world) nonetheless believe advisable. It would be a promising idea if it were achieved after a significant strengthening of Abu Mazen and/or the emergence of a united and strengthened Fateh leadership. Otherwise, there would simply be a repeat of the power struggle we have just witnessed in Gaza. Assuming that both options must give way ultimately to new elections in the PA, the choice must be the one that would provide the better chance for a weakening of Hamas. 

The last option begs the question of split rule within the occupied territories and is based on the assumption that the end of the occupation could change the entire political picture. The Palestinians, in the form of the PLO, are part of the Arab League (listed as the "State of Palestine") where they are represented by Abu Mazen. Were Israel to agree to enter negotiations on the basis of the Arab peace initiative, and if a peace agreement were reached, we might expect a number of things.  

First, Hamas would be hard put to garner a majority against an agreement that puts an end to the occupation on the basis of the two-state solution. Second, an international peace-keeping force on the borders would be far more likely in the event of a peace agreement. Third, it would be most difficult if not impossible for a rejectionist minority to persist significantly with the countries of the entire Arab world standing behind normalization, security arrangements and peace with Israel.
