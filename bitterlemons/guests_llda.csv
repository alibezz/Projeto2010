"Isr","Neut","What Palestinians should understand about Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon's unilateral plan are first that it is real, and second that the
United States is in broad agreement with it. This situation presents
Palestinians with a critical question: what do they really want?

The US will not agree to everything Israel might want to do. The exact
route of the security fence is still under discussion. The US will
oppose an eastern fence, between the ridgeline and the Jordan Valley,
and will oppose the annexation of any West Bank territory to Israel.

Don't be fooled, however, by the coming tussles over details. The
critical components of Sharon's plan are: 1) settlement evacuation in
almost all of Gaza and next to Palestinian cities in the West Bank, 2)
increasing the population in the settlement blocs, such as Gush Etzion
and Ma'ale Adumim, that Israel expects to keep, 3) continued military
action against terrorism and missile threats in Palestinian areas, as
necessary.

The US will support Israel on all three counts, because the package is
not seen to conflict with George W. Bush's two state vision and the
roadmap to it. So long as Palestinians choose the path of terror and
violence, the US will press Israel to minimize the impact of its fight
on Palestinian civilians, but will not oppose broad military actions
against the terrorists themselves. Further, it is an open question how
long the US and Israel will continue to hold harmless a Palestinian
Authority which barely hides its support for terror, and certainly does
not lift a finger to stop it.

If there is a wild card in both US and Israeli policy in the year ahead,
it is to what extent Bush's original June 2002 message
                    on the need for a new Palestinian leadership will be
revived. During the run-up to the war in Iraq, that message morphed into
the roadmap                         and the US-European demand for a
Palestinian prime minister. Now Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is gone, but
so is the idea that a Palestinian prime minister will painlessly wrest
Yasser Arafat's veto power away from him and allow the crackdown against
terror necessary for real negotiations to begin.

Though Sharon's plan is rightly seen as consistent with the goal and
broad structure of the roadmap, the means are a substitute for that
plan. Further, Sharon's unilateralism is at least a detour from the
belief in the necessity of Palestinian regime change that a short time
ago Bush and Sharon seemed to share.

But this detour, while seemingly shifting the focus away from Bush's new
leadership demand, could bring its wisdom into sharper focus. Yasser
Arafat's serial torpedoing of the 2000 Camp David summit, the roadmap,
and two successive prime ministers has demonstrated that he will never
abandon terror or the demand of ""return,"" and therefore will never sign
a final two state peace with Israel. Sharon's separation will further
highlight the Palestinians' choice between continuing to fight Israel
far past the point of diminishing returns, or getting on with creating
their own state.

For a generation, Israel was torn between two incompatible paradigms:
staking a claim over all the territories, and trading them for peace.
Sharon's plan is designed to cut this Gordian knot in favor of land for
peace. This forces Palestinians to face their own Gordian knot: choosing
between contradictory attempts to destroy Israel and make peace with it.

The idea that United Nations votes can accomplish what tanks could not
is a tempting one for Palestinians. Time, and demography, are on their
side, goes this thinking. And the tremendous sacrifices in the current
war would not be for naught, but the harbingers of a total victory.

But in its unrealism this Palestinian messianism resembles nothing if
not that of ""greater Israel"" proponents who believed the circle could
somehow be squared between demography and democracy. The Palestinians
cannot, after they convinced the entire world they wanted a state next
to Israel, say ""we changed our minds, we want to become citizens of
Israel,"" against the will of even left-wing Israelis like Amos Oz.

So the Palestinians have a choice. Bet on the world joining, and Israel
succumbing to, a campaign telling Israelis, ""yes, you must commit
suicide and become the 22nd Arab state."" Or alternatively, drop terror
and the demand of ""return"" to Israel in exchange for a partition and a
state of their own.

It took over 30 years for Israel to settle the debate between trying to
keep the land and giving it up (though Sadat-like Palestinian gestures
would have convinced Israelis much sooner). It is taking Palestinians
even longer to decide between trying to destroy Israel and living next
to it. The Sharon plan and US support for it, which will not be
fundamentally reversed even if the Democrats take the White House in
November, mean that the territorial price the Palestinians pay for
delaying their decision will only go up over time. 
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What is your analysis of the American administration's
reception to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's ""disengagement"" plan?

A: There has been a pattern to American responses to
initiatives taken by Sharon over the last three years of the intifada,
whether military or political. First, there is surprise and then there
are negotiations. We are seeing the same with this initiative--first,
there was displeasure and surprise and now there is a team in the United
States negotiating the details.

It is entirely possible that they might agree to something. The American
reservations are generally well known, for instance [that Israel] not
transfer any settlers from the Gaza Strip to the West Bank, and also
that there be ""adjustments"" to the wall. But it remains to be seen what
they finally agree to.

Q: What does this do to the roadmap                        ?

A: The roadmap, practically speaking, has been dead since the
minute the present Israeli government posed its 14 reservations, of
which the US administration accepted 12. But there are explicit
references in the Sharon plan that make the death of the roadmap more
official. One of the aspects [of Sharon's plan] is to convince the
Americans that there be no negotiations with Palestinians unless there
is a change of leadership. This is not a part of the roadmap.

Q: Why do you think that the US administration would be
willing to alter the vision presented by US President George Bush in
that manner?

A: That depends how seriously one takes President Bush's
vision. It has no details and no timetable. Sharon claims that his plan
need not conflict with President Bush's vision, provided--as he
says--that the partner on the other side fulfills certain conditions. In
a way, the Bush administration was kind of pushed into it by the Arab
and some European countries; the vision itself is rather wishy-washy,
especially since there is no power behind it.

Q: Do you think that Sharon is serious?

A: I note that it has been argued over the last two or three
years that [Sharon] has no political plan. This is a bit odd because
only one month after he was elected he conducted an interview with
/Haaretz/ newspaper in which he specified clearly what he was thinking,
which is exactly what he is now trying to execute: a Palestinian state
on 42 percent of the West Bank and a long-term agreement with final
negotiations at an indefinite date.

That is exactly what he is trying to execute at the present time, with
or without a Palestinian partner.

Q: What is your prognosis for the conflict?

A: In my opinion, it is very bleak. These moves will mean
continued conflict in various shapes or forms, but it is obvious that
without Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967, there
will not be peace between Israelis and Arabs. The present formula of
Sharon's plan ensures continued conflict, especially if carried out
unilaterally. It will mean almost total separation between the West Bank
and Gaza. The wall that is being erected will become the focus of
different types of conflict or struggle. The situation will continue
like this until there is pressure on the Israeli government to be
serious about peace in the area.

Q: Given that, what are the Palestinian Authority's options?

A: There are various options, but the problem that the
Palestinian Authority faces is that they are not taking any initiative.
They are leaving the initiative in the hands of the present Israeli
government. Part of the reason for that is that what preoccupies the
current Palestinian leadership is their political survival.

For instance, some ideas have been under public discussion for the last
two or three months. One option would be to state to all interested
parties that the Palestinian Authority will dissolve itself barring
specific steps are made to advance the peace process--and then to go
ahead with that if need be, leaving Israel to bear the full burden of
occupation that it is not bearing now.

This is one option--it need not be the only option. But the main problem
is that there is political paralysis in the Palestinian Authority and a
lack of initiative. At the present time, the only option is to react to
what Sharon does, which is a position of weakness. 
"
"Isr","Neut","Since 1967 every American president has made a key speech in which he
presented the administration's views regarding the basic components of a
solution to the Israel-Arab conflict. Not one of these speeches has
stuck in our memory. Comprehensive American solutions like the Rogers
Plan (1969), the Reagan Plan (1982) and even the fresher Clinton Plan
(2000) never constituted a basis for negotiations; they have remained as
little more than code names for the American approach.

Will the Bush Plan of 2002 suffer the same fate? The answer depends on
two key factors: the components of the plan, and the determination of
the president and his administration to carry it out.

The programmatic part of Bush's speech reflects an internal logic that
is problematic mainly from the Palestinian standpoint. While the
two-state vision is presented in Bush's opening lines, the road to a
Palestinian state is paved with a series of tasks that would be complex
and challenging for any nation, but especially for Palestinian society
in its current state. From the US standpoint, realization of the vision
is conditioned upon fulfillment of a number of objectives:

* a new and different Palestinian leadership;
* genuine reform rather than cosmetic change;
* the reforms are intended to produce new and democratic political and
economic institutions, a market economy and anti-terrorism measures. The
new institutions include a strong and authoritative legislature, a
constitution that establishes separation of powers, and a government
capable of exercising effective rule;
* economic reform predicated on transparency and good management;
* reforms in the judiciary and in the security services;
* and of course, again, a war against terrorism.

When the Palestinians achieve these objectives, the US will support the
establishment of a provisional Palestinian state. Since no explanation
is offered for this provisional status, we may assume that the president
believes that following negotiations with Israel over the final borders
of a Palestinian state, its capital and other aspects of sovereignty
(did the president refer here to control over air space, for example, or
to demilitarization?), it will be awarded a permanent status. Throughout
the entire Oslo process, deadlines repeatedly turned into bad jokes,
with neither party adhering to a single one. President Bush avoided
setting timetables for achieving his objectives, with the sole--and
strange--exception of local elections, which are supposed to take place
by the end of this year.

Even the list of Israeli tasks opens with a Palestinian task, a
condition: ""as we make progress toward security"" and ""as violence
subsides,""

* Israel will withdraw completely to the pre-September 28, 2000 lines;
* settlement activity must cease;
* the Palestinian economy will be able to develop, along with
normalization, and revenues collected for the PA and frozen by Israel
will be delivered to honest and accountable hands.

These steps will be followed by discussion of the issues of Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees and borders. Here President Bush emphasizes US
support for an Israeli withdrawal to ""secure and recognized borders.""

Finally, the president asserts that with an intensive effort these goals
can be attained in three years.

From the standpoint of the key regional players, Bush's speech
constitutes a classic instance of the glass that is both half-full and
half-empty. America's unique status internationally, the influence of
the events of September 11, and the US's determined stance on
terrorism--all oblige the regional players to respond positively to the
half-full glass and to mutter their criticisms of the half-empty glass
through gritted teeth.

From the standpoint of the Palestinians and the Arab world the call to
remove the current leadership, i.e., Yasir Arafat, is extremely
demanding if not impossible. As for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, even
without the Bush speech he did not intend to negotiate with Arafat, and
the speech relieves him with near finality of the possibility that such
negotiations will be imposed upon him.

Nor are the other reforms simple to achieve, particularly if the US
indeed insists that they be more than cosmetic.

Particularly problematic from the Arab-Palestinian standpoint is the
lack of synchronization, not only between the Palestinian and Israeli
tracks, but particularly between the reduction of terrorism and
enhancement of security, on the one hand, and the steps that Israel is
asked to take, such as ceasing settlement activity, on the other. The
synchronization that was implicit in the Mitchell Plan of April 2001 has
been replaced by what looks like a sequential process that begins with a
cessation of terrorism.

In this sense the president's speech sounded at times like a piano
concert in which it is not always clear how the music played by the left
hand is related to that of the right hand. The speech's internal logic
and the call for Palestinians to replace Arafat enable PM Sharon to
praise the speech. Yet at the same time, in the president's vision a
Palestinian state will emerge, its borders will be determined in
accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, and
questions like Jerusalem and the refugees will be on the president's
agenda, even if Clinton's approach to them was not adopted. These are
the elements that will help the Palestinians digest Bush's speech.

Whether this speech survives as a plan of action will be determined by a
number of factors: possible erosion in the will of both sides to
maintain a situation that involves not only ongoing loss of life but
deep economic damage; an absence of alternatives; and a disconnect in
bilateral communication. The addition of certain elements in the near
term could improve the speech's survivability. These include convening a
regional conference, accelerating processes dependent on international
aid such as reform of economic institutions and enhancement of the
economic situation, release of revenues by Israel, and relaxation of
Israeli closures that could permit a phased but rapid return to as much
normalcy as possible.

Finally, all the regional actors should bear in mind that there are
still more than two years remaining in President Bush's first term,
without taking into account the possibility of a second term. None of
the actors on the international scene has any good reason to enter into
confrontation with him and the US.-Published 1/7/02 
"
"Pal","Neut","United States President George W. Bush's speech was a major
disappointment for all concerned, except for extremists and right wing
politicians in Israel. Even the G-8 during their recent meeting in
Canada could not go along with Bush's recipe for ""regime change"" in
Palestine, i.e. deciding who should and who shouldn't run for elections
for the office Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat holds at present. As some
commentators in Israel pointed out, Bush's speech could have been
written by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon himself.

Reform has been a long-standing internal Palestinian demand, well before
its belated discovery by the Bush administration. Fighting corruption,
accountability at every level, rule of law and regular elections have
been demanded by Palestinians in countless petitions, reports,
demonstrations, and recommendations over the years.

Reform was thwarted for various reasons including the fact that the
""Oslo model"" was built on the assumption of the existence of an
authoritarian and corrupt Palestinian regime that was able to deliver
the goods. Before the outbreak of the present conflict, this arrangement
was quite acceptable to various Israeli governments, as long as ""final
status"" issues were postponed, and settlement and land confiscation
continued.

Before he was assassinated by a right-wing extremist, former prime
minister Yitzhak Rabin put it clearly: the Palestinian Authority (PA)
will govern ""without human rights organizations and a supreme court"" (lo
Betselem ve lo Bagatz). One pillar of the Oslo model, as an Israeli
commentator put it recently, involved entrusting the PA with policing
its own population in the interest of Israeli security as
""subcontractors in return for personal and economic advancement and
vague political promises"" (Ha'aretz, April 18, 2002; emphasis added).

From the point of view of the PA, these ""promises and understandings""
were not kept, even though both sides were very close to reaching an
agreement at Taba in January 2001, before former prime minister Ehud
Barak decided to stop the negotiations. Even now, the PA appears willing
to continue playing its former role, provided there is a political
quid-pro-quo.

Therein lies the crux of the matter. Leaving the rhetoric of
demonization aside, Arafat is not a partner from Sharon's point of view
for at least two reasons: First, Sharon understands that Arafat cannot
accept as a final agreement much less than was reached in the
negotiations at Taba, and as summarized in a document prepared by
European Union envoy Miguel Moratinos who was present at the time (text
in Ha'aretz, February 14, 2002).

Second, while it appears in principle possible to arrive at another
""interim"" agreement with the PA as Sharon prefers, the fact that Arafat,
from Sharon's point of view, resorted to a form of armed conflict to
""extract"" political concessions is not forgivable since, among other
things, it undermines Israel's deterrent military power.

This opinion is also shared by the out-going Chief of Staff, Sha'ul
Mofaz. And in the ringing words of another right-winger, former defense
minister Moshe Arens, Palestinians have to be defeated first so that
""peace"" can be made with them. ""Reform"" and ""regime change"" are meant as
additional deterrence for any future Palestinian leadership tempted to
stray from the ""negotiated process"".

The fact of the matter is that significant negotiations have been taking
place throughout the ""Oslo process"" among different Israeli parties, on
what is acceptable for them to offer the Palestinians. In the present
government, the majority opinion ranges from ethnic cleansing that now
goes by the name of ""transfer,"" to disconnected cantons under Israeli
hegemony.

It is here that the failure of US leadership can be seen most clearly,
reaching an extreme form under the Bush administration. For public
opinion in Israel has been drifting to the right for the past two
decades. As a result, the ""Land of Israel"" ideology became increasingly
influential in Israeli politics, largely because Israel has been able to
occupy Palestinian land for 35 years with impunity. This was only
possible with US support.

A singular success of Israel as a state has been its ability to
neutralize external pressure. The systematic and dogged work of the
Israel lobby and of Israel's supporters over the years in the US has
been far too successful in pushing various Israeli agendas, to the
detriment of peace, stability, and a fair compromise.

Indeed, the late Yitzhak Rabin was a victim of this success, since it
contributed to the growth of the extreme right wing in Israel, to which
his assassin belonged.

As a result, the Bush Administration has only a domestic agenda as far
as the present conflict is concerned. This, combined with Zionist
messianism marching on with the colonial imperative of redeeming land
and resources from Palestinians, is a sure recipe for continued
conflict. That is why the ""peace process"" has so far failed.

With or without Arafat, peace will not be achieved unless the US and
Europe press their official position that the West Bank and Gaza are
occupied territories that Israel must evacuate in return for peace.
Nothing short of this will ensure a stable solution. But who is
interested in stability, let alone peace?
"
"Isr","Neut","""Is the roadmap                                                  dead?""
Before addressing this question, one may remember that many observers,
including myself, maintained all along that in its present form there
were too many ""holes"" in it to make it work. It suffices to mention the
unworkable timetables or the absence of what Israel sees as an absolute
must--the annulment of the so-called ""right of return."" Even the
""vision"" of a ""democratic, viable Palestinian state"" living in peace
alongside Israel, inevitably raises the question of why the projected
Palestinian state should be different from most other Arab states?

However, the most substantial issue is the imperative to stop
Palestinian terror and violence. This was especially important to
Israelis after the abject failure of the Oslo agreement, the breakdown
of the Barak-Clinton initiative at Camp David, and the outbreak of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's ""al Aqsa intifada"". The current
Israeli government thus sees the end of terror as crucial for a
meaningful political process. This was reinforced, both in Israel and in
the US, after 9/11 and the Bush administration's clear and unequivocal
stand against terrorism. The roadmap, in spite of several attempts by
members of the Quartet to shift the emphasis, mandated clearly that the
Palestinian Authority must begin ""sustained, targeted and effective
operations"" to dismantle terrorist infrastructure, etc. None of that
happened. Instead, the Palestinian Authority concluded a temporary
ceasefire (/hudna/) with Hamas and Islamic Jihad that was used by those
groups as a breather to regroup and rearm, and it soon became evident
that the terror groups did not regard the hudna as an absolute stop to
violence--nor did Arafat.

At the time of writing, the internal Palestinian political situation is
far from clear, and the outcome of the crisis is bound to have an impact
on the future of the roadmap. Another important element is the currently
insufficient concrete support the ""map"" enjoys from the Arab world. As
Dennis Ross recently wrote: ""Prime Minister Abbas needs the cover of
Arab legitimacy to confront Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the al-Aqsa Brigades.""

The usual Palestinian explanation for failing to act against the
terrorists is that they do not want to risk civil war, though it is far
from clear whether a more determined action would in fact have led to
civil war--or whether this argument is but a subterfuge to refrain from
action. Be this as it may, Israelis wonder whether the present
Palestinian political crisis is not just a contest between Arafat who
doesn't /want/ to deliver and Abbas who /can't/ (or at least doesn't
want to get his feet wet in /trying/ to deliver). Paradoxically,
Israel's renewed military operations against the terrorists might now
give the roadmap a new lease on life--with Israel doing the Palestinians
""dirty work"". Though Washington has few remaining illusions about the
Abbas government, it has not given up on it yet, but it has left no
doubt as to where the main responsibility lies for the crisis in the
roadmap.

""But what about the settlements?"" Though this subject must indeed come
up sooner or later, the equation between /stopping/ terror and
/freezing/ settlements looks to most Israelis disingenuous. On the other
hand, had the Palestinian Authority lived up to its primary obligations
with regard to fighting terror, this would have put the onus for
continuing the process squarely on Israel. At present, Prime Minister
Sharon, facing increasing opposition from inside his own party and
coalition with regard to several aspects of the roadmap, is not even
required to face some of the more difficult decisions in it.

The Bush administration's Middle East policy was based on three
interrelated points: victory in Iraq, reform and democratization of the
Arab world, and ""solving"" the Arab-Jewish conflict. After years of
America projecting an image of being a ""paper tiger"", Middle Easterners
looked in awe, though not always with glee, at America's decisive and
swift military victory over Saddam Hussein.

Basically, this attitude has not yet changed. The ""link"" between
America's enhanced position and the Palestinian-Israeli equation was
that Palestinians were given to understand that only if they renounced
terror, and only with American support, could they realize part of their
aspirations. Palestinians also hoped that given America's overall design
for the Middle East, pressure would be put on Israel to make concessions
beyond those the latter was ready to make. However, as long as
Palestinian terror continues--especially with Yasir Arafat trying to
reassume absolute power--the chances for this scenario to materialize
are highly doubtful, even without involving ourselves in American
domestic politics.

Much will indeed depend on how the US pursues its aims with regard to
Iraq. America's precipitate withdrawal, 20 years ago, from Beirut led to
decades of losing face in the Middle East--and indirectly to many of the
region's upheavals. But Iraq and creating a durable framework for
Persian Gulf and regional security are far more important than Beirut
ever was! Palestinians, like others in the Middle East, will therefore
carefully watch how the US deals with the Iraqi situation--and draw
their conclusions accordingly.

So, is there still a chance for the roadmap? Though some argue that it
was stillborn in the first place, one could also make a case that after
some thorough retooling it could yet lead to positive results. Setting
the sights a bit lower, and provided the difficult first stage can be
overcome, the ""map"" could still function as a general compass to bring
the two sides to a long-term ""modus vivendi"" which, though short of
solving all the outstanding issues (e.g., Jerusalem, holy places, or the
final borders of the future Palestinian entity) would nevertheless put
an end to violence and give the two peoples an extended period of calm
and prosperity.

Full fledged idyllic ""comprehensive"" peace between Israel and the
Palestinians will probably have to wait for generational changes--but,
after all, this would not be so different from what history has shown in
other parts of the world, including Europe: first pragmatic arrangements
and only then permanent peace.
"
"Pal","Neut","The troubled circumstances of Palestinians in the occupied territories
today most aptly demonstrate the extent and depth of the fascism of the
Israeli occupation. Systematic acts of assassination are at their
height. More and more Palestinian mothers and families have their hearts
broken at the hands of what I call the ""slaughter of Sharon."" This is
taking place to deafening Arab silence and in the midst of international
ineptitude. The curfews continue and Israeli jails continue to fill with
Palestinian prisoners in intolerable conditions. In addition, the new
Berlin wall, a wall of isolation, continues to snake through Palestinian
land. In other words, one might say that, for Palestinians, the roadmap
                                                 has been turned into a
path of blood, anguish and suffering.

At the same time, and I write this with deep regret and sorrow, we have
a Palestinian cabinet headed by Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) that continues
to engage in political mismanagement. In my view, this mismanagement is
negatively affecting Palestinian national interests tremendously.
Incongruently, and despite the dramatic state of affairs I have just
described, Abu Mazen's government has not called for suspending talks
with the Israeli occupation institution, but has instead called for
cutting off talks with Palestinian resistance groups. Instead of
directing its anger and its energies at pressuring the Israeli
government to end its violations, we find this government almost across
the board doing its best to weaken the struggle against the occupation.

Several statements by cabinet ministers damning the Palestinian
resistance have contributed to the recent escalation of tensions within
Palestinian society. The assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Abu Shanab
by Israeli warplanes interrupted the beginnings of a serious Palestinian
feud. A cabinet whose ministers consider Palestinian resistance--not the
tenacity and belligerence of the Israeli occupation--damaging to
Palestinian national interests does not express the feelings of the
Palestinian street and does not represent Palestinian ambitions. (It
must be said that not every minister in this government bears the same
culpability, and some statements of sanity have made their way through
the fog.)

Who is it that defines Palestinian national interests more so than the
active and the functional political forces on the ground? These are
forces that emanate out of Palestinian suffering--deep suffering--and it
is these forces that work diligently to put an end to Palestinian
suffering, not this or that cabinet minister.

Today, the Palestinian situation is in a precarious position and it is
time for wisdom and rationality to dominate over conspiratorial tactics.
The symbol of Palestinian nationalism, Yasser Arafat, deserves this; the
difficult struggle endured by the Palestinian people merits this; and
the retention of Palestinian rights, which are in my view more sacred
than the land itself and all its holy sites, make this imperative. The
sanctity of our rights demands the semblance of stability.

The United States, for its part, seems to be terribly pleased that it
has found domestic tools that will work diligently to achieve its
objectives in Palestinian society. These objectives, which are bound to
fail, mean to weaken the Palestinian struggle, to marginalize Yasser
Arafat and to work in a calculated way to assassinate him politically
and morally in the eyes of Palestinian society, which he loves and which
loves him. The role of the United States, which centers on meddling in
Palestinian politics to strengthen and maintain some members of the
Abbas government, does not take into account Palestinian interests nor
has it put an end to /any single aspect/ of the Israeli occupation. The
larger objective of the United States is to make the Palestinian
struggle unacceptable to Palestinians themselves; finding Palestinian
tools to achieve this has been a most gratifying development for the
Bush administration.

Let me give just one example. Why, instead of exerting pressure on the
Palestinian government to freeze the accounts of Islamic charitable
organizations, did not the Bush administration and the Palestinian
government itself work first to find a substitute for the thousands of
needy families that rely on those organizations for their daily bread?
Freezing these accounts and providing no alternative only strengthened
the Islamic movements, as they have now been handed a new mobilization
tool through which to shore up their backing in Palestinian society.

It is time for the Abbas government to save face and apologize to the
Palestinian people--a people that has contributed thousands of martyrs
and wounded to this struggle--for the recent comments of its ministers.
Indeed, it may be time for this government to courageously resign of its
own volition: first, because it is no longer acceptable to Palestinian
society, but more so because it is no longer accepted by Fateh, the
forefront of the Palestinian struggle.

This government can no longer shift the Palestinian people from one
political catastrophe to another. It is not acceptable for the
Palestinian government to move the Palestinian people further towards
fragmentation and dispersal. The situation that we find ourselves in has
no room for added experimentation with Palestinian lives and the destiny
of the Palestinian cause.
"
"Isr","Neut","Together with ten Israelis and Palestinians I was recently privileged to
write an action plan for the implementation of Israel's withdrawal from
the Gaza Strip.

What is this plan all about? What are its objectives?

The plan, which was drafted in Greece and is called the ""Athens Plan
                                             "", is based on the need to
transform Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's disengagement plan from a
unilateral program that may bring about chaos, humanitarian crisis and
domination by Hamas in Gaza, into a bilateral, Israeli-Palestinian plan,
supported by the international community. As such it may serve as a
positive model for future measures, wherein both terror and occupation
will be ended.

What are the advantages of this specific plan?

First, it is a very practical program. It does not deal with future
borders or other problems related to a final status agreement. The
Athens Plan can be fully implemented next week if all parties involved
agree. The plan is concrete, practical and comprehensive. It combines
the military measures that must be taken, with the economic measures
that are required to change the lives of 1.4 million residents of the
Gaza Strip: trade, agriculture, housing, transportation, etc.

Secondly, it is a genuine co-production of Israelis and Palestinians.
The plan was prepared through a process of brainstorming, discussions by
sub-groups (economic and political), and finally a joint effort to iron
out the disagreements in the wording of the final version. The fact that
all 11 participants are mainstream and not fringe figures in their
respective societies indicates that the plan is based on a real
convergence of national interests and on a constructive compromise
wherever interests or concepts contradict one another.

Last but not least, on each issue, in each domain, the plan details for
Israel, for the Palestinian Authority and for the Arab states and
international community what they should do.

Why is this plan good for Israel?

First, its successful implementation ensures that the Gaza Strip will
not be a Hamastan, a base for terror and incitement, but a place where
law and order prevail and terror activity ceases, so that Israeli
soldiers are never again in Gaza. Secondly, it prevents the outbreak of
a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, a crisis for which Israel will
be blamed and from whose consequences it will suffer.

Most important, if the Athens Plan is successfully implemented, the Gaza
Strip and the northern West Bank will be a model for the future. Israel
will be able to continue handing over additional areas of the West Bank,
subject to the cessation of terror and followed by economic development.

Even the initial implementation of such a plan will change the
atmosphere, increase tourism and investment in Israel, and revive hope
after four years of war.
"
"Pal","Neut","George Papandreous was almost in a trance dancing, surrounded by
cheering supporters. This was Greece, in the summer, and I had accepted
an invitation from the UCLA to participate in a brain storming session
on the hot topic of the day, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's
disengagement plan, with a handful of prominent Israelis and
Palestinians and hosted by a distinguished American scholar. Personally,
I also wanted to breathe some fresh air, even if hot, as opposed to the
suffocating atmosphere in Gaza.

We had little time to enjoy the beautiful beaches of Porto Heli, but we
enjoyed the warm Greek hospitality and one breezy evening we were in for
a special treat when we were invited to meet the charismatic Papandreous
who is not only an accomplished politician but also a keen folk dancer.
While George danced like Zorba, my mind went back to my first night in
Athens in 1965 when I arrived as representative of the executive board
of the Palestinian Students Union, had my first taste of Ouzo and woke
up with a headache and Frank Sinatra singing ""Strangers in the Night"".
That was back in the dying days of colonialism when an exciting world
was bursting with liberation movements.

In our first session, Professor Steven L. Spiegel opened the discussion
by asking for opening statements. The Israeli participants, almost as
one, proceeded to express their belief that the disengagement plan was
an opportunity to salvage the peace process. For my part, I expressed my
reservations about Sharon's intentions. Two Israeli delegates, however,
dismissed the question as irrelevant. It was as if I had entered into a
discussion of metaphysics in the company of a group of logical
positivists. ""Why bother ourselves with intentions?"" one friend
exclaimed. ""All that matters is that he is going to leave Gaza."" And, in
a tone I imagine preachers have used down the centuries, he added, ""you
should hang on to this opportunity or you will again miss a chance as
you have so many times.""

We on the Palestinian side were not in a good mood. We were exhausted,
bewildered and wounded. We knew that we were losing ground by the day,
as well as land. We knew that we have given Sharon all he needs in terms
of excuses and justifications to kill and destroy in the name of
fighting terror. We were deeply disturbed, not only because we had left
our people behind in big and small prisons, but because we realized that
our just cause of liberation was being twisted and abused so that we had
to defend ourselves not just against the oppression of the occupation
but against the ""terrorist"" label. We knew that we were in a serious
mess, because of Sharon as well as our internal polarization.

So, very quickly we moved on to the practical meaning of the
disengagement plan and what might be requested from us to turn it into
an opportunity. We left the ""metaphysical"" question of intentions and
talked about economics, the settlements, the elections, and of course,
security. After two days of discussions we were ready for a draft paper,
now published under the title ""The Athens Plan
                                             "". It calls for the
Palestinian Authority to unite its security forces and proceed with the
elections. It calls for major economic rehabilitation and development
with an emphasis on the Arab and European roles. Above all it asserts
the position that the disengagement plan can only be successful if it is
part of the roadmap.

Nonetheless, I left Greece with my lingering question about Sharon's
intentions. And then, in early October, in a Haaretz interview with a
close confidante and top advisor to Sharon, Dov Weissglas pops up and
candidly tells the whole world that the intention of the disengagement
plan is to freeze the peace process, to prevent the establishment of a
Palestinian state and to postpone indefinitely any questions of land,
Jerusalem, borders and refugees.

For the last four years former Israeli premier Ehud Barak, Sharon and US
president George W. Bush have worked hard to spread the slogan that
there is no Palestinian partner to peace. Now I have a question: Who
destroyed the Palestinian Authority and kept pounding its infrastructure
every time there was a Hamas suicide bombing? This is a question that
will strike Sharon in the face if President Yasser Arafat is leaving the
political field. The question will soon be, is there an Israeli partner
for peace?
"
"Isr","Neut","Common wisdom, sometimes laced with a degree of malice, has it that the
US cannot do much to help the peace process along in an election year,
let alone an election year as contentious and tense as 2004 promises to
be: ""no president would antagonize American Jews by imposing a solution
on Israel, when he is up for re-election.""

There is, of course--as in all effective distortions--a kernel of
informative truth in this assertion. No US president--in an election
year, or any year--would gladly antagonize an active and highly
committed and mobilized community. Moreover, being attentive to the
legitimate needs of Israel--for reasons which combine good strategic
sense, a commonality of values, and shrewd political calculation--is by
now ""as American as apple pie,"" and has been a mainstay of policy for
every administration, at least since President John F. Kennedy first
defined this as a special relationship. After all, there is little left
of the artificial lines separating foreign and domestic policy. North
Atlantic Treaty Organization expansion, policy on AIDS in Africa,
relations with Mexico all have merit, but were also influenced by the
support and active advocacy of important and pertinent American
constituencies.

And yet, this in itself is not the whole story, or even the most
important factor. Considerations related to ""the Jewish vote"" are
neither the first nor the fourth reason why the US will /not/ impose a
solution:

      1. To begin with, American policy in general--indeed, the basic
      concepts underlying the new ""industry"" of mediation, based on US
      practices--rejects the prospect of externally imposed solutions,
      which will always be, by definition, unpopular and brittle.
      Experience has shown that a strong and stable outcome can only
      emerge if the two sides learn to listen to each other's needs, not
      steer them into a collision course with an external power.

      2. Moreover, in the specific Arab-Israel context, American
      administrations--ever since President Eisenhower came to regret
      the pressure on Prime Minister Ben Gurion to withdraw from Sinai
      without peace in 1957--have come to the conclusion that an overly
      intrusive role by the US makes peace less likely to happen. Given
      the basic asymmetry of the situation, it tends to play up Arab
      expectations, and thus reduces the prospects for meaningful
      compromise. Hence the famous statement by Secretary of State James
      Baker, back in 1989, that the US cannot want peace more than the
      sides themselves, and will not ""deliver"" Israel.

      3. Any US commitment to support some Palestinian aspiration, at
      the present time, must first be based on a Palestinian
      commitment--to decide which side they are on in the war on
      terrorism, and to act accordingly. Until they do, they cannot
      appeal for a US role--and then complain bitterly that the
      president is openly calling for a new Palestinian leadership and
      refuses to do any further business with Yasser Arafat.

      4. Finally, the US will not be swept into a position in which it
      agrees to bypass the Israeli political process. Respect for the
      outcome of a democratic vote is a profound American value.

American Jews love peace. Every other synagogue, congregation or temple
carries the term ""shalom"" in its name. And yet for these four reasons,
they stand guard against the temptation of choosing the option of
American coercion--and will continue to do so in the future. A great
majority among them feels that coercion cannot serve as a ""shortcut"" to
peace. Today, as ever, they are able to influence policy only when the
broad outlines of their positions fit comfortably with general American
interests and values. Thus, they will support and even demand some
Israeli ""give"" on controversial questions, such as the settlements; but
will always back Israel on security and identity issues, such as the
fence, the ""right of return,"" and above all, the status of Jerusalem. On
all of these issues, they can expect their sensibilities to be in line
with those of the majority of Americans, as represented by the US
Congress.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: How would you gauge the American public mood
vis-a-vis the Palestinian-Israeli conflict?

A: The major issues are Iraq and the economy. Coverage of
Palestine shows how bad the wall is, for example, but does not criticize
[Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon nor is it supportive of the Geneva
initiative.

Q: Do you see ways that this public mood is playing
into the run-up to the elections?

A: The problem is that we know what the position of the
Republicans is concerning the conflict. We have the experience of the
past three years of [President George W.] Bush, with his being so
supportive of Sharon and allowing the Israeli government basically to do
what it does best. For Palestinians, this has been quite one-sided and
catastrophic, and actually in contrast with previous US positions.

From the Democrats, we are not hearing what they would do and what might
be the alternative. There is some backstage work in support of the
Geneva initiative, things that you don't hear about in the press and
mostly in academic and policymaking circles. But as far as the Democrats
are concerned, there seems to be no real position.

Q: What about independent candidates, such as Ralph Nader?

A: This has not yet seemed to take off. A lot of people have
been surprised as to why Ralph Nader is not yet on the scene.

One big concern in the US is what to do with the Patriot Act. An
alternative voice will be one that tries to tackle the issue of
September 11 legislation that very badly hit the Arab-American
community, among them Palestinians. Many are in detention, are being
deported, so civil rights issues are on the agenda if you are on a
progressive platform.

And as always in the US, foreign issues are not campaign issues.
Americans are much more concerned with domestic issues or major issues
like the war, which involves US soldiers. There is starting to be real
opposition to the war; everyday two are three soldiers are being killed,
and that is really having an effect on people here.

Q: With a Republican agenda so supportive of Sharon,
how do you explain the hundreds of millions of dollars in loan
guarantees held back because Israel continues to build the wall?

A: It is my understanding that this is a diplomatic move to say
that ""we are not fully supportive of all Sharon does,"" but that the
United States is still not ready to throw its strength against a
different position. This is a tactical position, not a genuine change in
position. And we are talking about taxpayers' money going to a wall that
will only create more refugees--that doesn't really support the US
peacekeeping mission in the world.

Q: What do you think will be the impact of the
elections on the situation on the ground in Palestine?

A: Perhaps that is the question that is most difficult to
answer. It is very scary for all of us here--Palestinians, activists for
Palestine and people on a higher level--the positions that the United
States has taken. The Republicans are getting a lot of criticism on
Iraq--it's not working, it's backfiring--and they are getting a lot of
criticism from the Europeans.

But my suspicion is that the Republicans will be reelected. That will be
a carte blanche for their politics in Iraq, and that will mean they will
then allow Israel to do whatever it wants to do. The Likud is very
strong here, and their financiers are very strong.

If the Democrats were to win, I think their solution would be to find a
way out of Iraq very quickly and then perhaps to return to the agenda of
the Clinton era and perhaps be more firm with Israel (although I don't
really know what firm is). Firm seems to be saying that you are not
going to give money [to Israel] for the wall, but at the same time
giving a great deal of money for settlements.

But I also think that people in Palestine are waiting to see what
happens in Iraq to know what will happen in Palestine. Iraq is
dominating the agenda.
"
"Isr","Neut","Like the battered wife who returns again and again to her violent
husband because ""this time he really promised"" to behave, so the roadmap
                                                 takes us back once
again to a course that always ends up badly. But with one difference:
this time the violent husband isn't even making empty promises to
behave. The empty promise is being made in his name by America.

And if until now it was somehow possible to close our eyes and not see
this syndrome repeating itself again and again--the process that is
supposed to lead to peace always precipitating a new outbreak of
Palestinian violence, terror and bloodshed, until it consumes itself,
and so on and on--after the last two years we can no longer avoid the
question: why did the Palestinians initiate such a violent and
determined war precisely when former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and they had reached the phase of end of occupation, removal of
settlements and the establishment of a Palestinian state?

I know the answers that the fanatical Israeli left likes to give itself,
followed of course in turn by all Israel-haters throughout the world: we
are guilty. Barak and US President Bill Clinton did not prepare properly
for Camp David II; they insulted Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. If
only Barak had addressed him with greater warmth and given him a little
more time to bargain, after all, you know that this is what a man of the
East requires. And he didn't really offer him 96 percent, only 93. And
besides, lest we forget, Sharon went up on the Temple Mount and ignited
the entire region.

Not only are these not intelligent answers, nor even sad excuses, but
they embody something far more grave: a deep denigration of the
Palestinians. Would we declare war because someone did not treat Arik
Sharon (or even the distinguished Shimon Peres) nicely? Does a people
embark on a course of killing and being killed with such brutality
because of an argument over three or five percent of the territory (most
of which it could have gained by bargaining at the negotiating table)?

If you cannot give an intelligent answer to this question, then you
cannot draw a roadmap for peace in the Middle East. One way or the
other, the farthest thing from intelligent behavior is when at one and
the same time you are unable to explain why thus far the road has caused
us to crash, yet you propose once again to take the same road without
any appreciable change.

Here is an unpleasant but possible explanation: According to the
Palestinian (and general Arab) view, Israel is a colonialist entity of
people who came from Europe, invaded a country that did not belong to
them, cast out its legal owners and settled in their place. Israel could
not exist as a bone stuck in the throat of the Arab nation and a thorn
in the side of Islam were it not for the support of the wealthy
colonialist West, which has always sought to exploit the resources of
the suppressed portion of humanity. Within this context of classic
exploitation and suppression, Israel is a vehicle used by the West to
rule the Holy Land and its tourist resources. With all our empathy for
the Jews after what Hitler did to them, it is still unreasonable and
unjust for the wealthy West to solve their problem by destroying our
dream, our villages and our cities. The very creation of Israel was an
immoral act, and there can be no more just aspiration than to turn back
the clock and return Palestine to the status that preceded the Zionist
invasion.

I did not invent this diatribe. It is written in hundreds of thousands
of books, newspapers and internet sites, spoken in tens of thousands of
meetings and conventions, studied endlessly in schools, sermonized every
Friday in a million mosques. And confronting this huge tidal wave that
assails the Arab consciousness day and night from every direction, there
sails a little dinghy that declaims a mild political declaration, heard
once every few years as if under duress, concerning recognition of the
principle of two states for the two peoples. The Oslo system and the
roadmap postpone the confrontation between the tidal wave and the dinghy
to the greatest extent possible. Israeli withdrawal, a settlement
freeze, additional territory and authority for the Palestinians, even a
handshake and cooperation--all these can be neatly interpreted both as
steps toward peace and reconciliation and as stages in the big act of
turning back the clock and correcting the historical injustice.

This system of postponement has not proven itself. Every time we have
reached the moment of confrontation, along came the tidal wave and
overturned the dinghy. The only innovation of the roadmap is that it
postpones the moment of confrontation to a greater extent than all its
predecessors. In other words, it swamps the dinghy at a time when
huddled on its deck are thousands of victims.
"
"Pal","Neut","Initially, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon declared repeatedly that
the roadmap                                                  plan went
against all Israeli security and national interests, and placed many
conditions before he would consider accepting it. Only weeks later did
Sharon acquiesce--under great pressure from the United States and
because Israel was the only party who had yet to agree to the document.
All the eyes of the world were watching Sharon, and in response he had
to move forward to relieve that pressure.

In truth, the roadmap is not so bad for Israel. It allows for a very
long period of discussion and does not talk about the serious issues
before minor steps. All of the really important questions are postponed
until an indefinite date. While Sharon could not escape acceptance of
the roadmap, he is counting on escaping its implementation, and the
roadmap's many weaknesses make it an easy wager that Sharon will succeed.

For its part, the Palestinian Authority has no other options. It has
accepted all proposed solutions: from Oslo to the Hebron accords, Wye
River, Mitchell and the Tenet work plan. The Palestinian Authority is
traveling down a single track. It argues that Palestinians will accept
the roadmap because they will get something from Israel in return: push
the Israeli military back to the pre-intifada borders of September 28,
2000 or stop the growth of settlements, for example. The Palestinian
Authority wants to put the train back on the negotiations track because
it cannot go on fighting Israeli forces and is receiving little support
from Arab countries. The leadership feels itself alone against the
immense power and aggression of the Israeli occupation. In particular,
Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas has always believed that Palestinians
cannot gain by armed struggle against Israel and therefore, that we must
return to the peace process at any price.

But we have tested Israel many times. For ten years, we made agreement
after agreement, without implementation. This is the crux of the
Palestinian problem--the Palestinian Authority is always accepting
intervention from the United States, the European community, or even the
Israeli side, and then afterwards can do little but complain that Israel
is not committed and settlements are increasing and Israel is
confiscating more land. This language of defeat must stop. We cannot
waste more time because throughout, Palestinians are suffering. Their
problems are not waiting, as we wait for the agreement of the Israeli side.

The mistake of the Palestine Liberation Organization from the beginning
was that it agreed to comprehensive agreement and a partition of the
solution. In other words, all problems should be settled, and afterwards
the two sides would discuss the implementation stage by stage. Only
after accepting the roadmap will we talk about solving Jerusalem, the
refugees, the borders--all of the final issues. In order to resolve
these complicated problems, we will need twenty or thirty years. It is a
train on a circular track and eventually we will return to the very
first station.

Currently, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas and Islamic Jihad are in
dialogue over the implementation of the roadmap. This is something quite
normal because Hamas and the Authority are facing the same enemy: both
are looking to end the Israeli occupation. While there are differences
over the tactics and means, it is very important that the language used
to describe these differences is one of ""dialogue"". Repeatedly, Hamas
says that it will not use armed struggle against the Authority, and
Abbas has also indicated that he will not wield violence against the
Palestinian factions.

We are, as one Palestinian people, facing great troubles: Israeli
occupation, aggression, home demolitions and assassination. We will not
add more weight to our shoulders in the form of clashes between Hamas
and the Palestinian Authority. These two parties have become wise in
their disagreements and prefer to sit down and talk. Hamas has turned
increasingly pragmatic and wants to give Abbas a chance, but it also has
its conditions, which mean that Israel must stop at least some of its
illegal and unacceptable aggression. If Israel does not concede,
Hamas--or any other Palestinian faction, for that matter--will not
remain silent.

While the coming days may see some easing of tensions, it is very
difficult to imagine that the roadmap will endure. There are hundreds of
obstacles before the parties, and the roadmap offers no path for
navigating the most sensitive and important issues. We have seen George
Mitchell, Anthoni Zinni, George Tenet, Colin Powell, and now George Bush
come to the region, but none of their approaches worked. Prime Minister
Abbas will be unable to continue along the roadmap if there is no
pressure on Israel to evacuate settlements here in Gaza, for example, or
declare the boundaries of a Palestinian state. (A Palestinian state
surrounded by Israeli forces or full of settlements dividing Palestinian
towns is not an acceptable state.) In this, Prime Minister Abbas is
making the same mistake the PLO made in 1993 by agreeing to implement
the small things now, and ignoring the big problems until later. Israel
will force even the smallest negotiations to take much time, and then
there will be something--killing, demolishing,
assassinations--Palestinians will react and we will be back at that very
first station: how to bring about a real and immediate end to the
Israeli occupation.
"
"Isr","Neut","The relationship between human rights and conflict is a complex,
multidimensional one. With the conflagration of the conflict in the fall
of 2000, human rights violations increased dramatically in scale and
intensity. In the past three years and ten months, over 3,800 people
have been killed, tens of thousands have been wounded, thousands of
houses have been destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of people have
been placed under siege. The conflict has wrought poverty, humiliation,
hostility, and polarization. Though human rights are also violated in
societies at peace, such violations are endemic to a conflict like our own.

Yet human rights violations are not merely a result of the conflict,
they are also a cause. It is impossible to adequately explain the
collapse of the Oslo process and the explosion of violence in September
2000 without mentioning the expansion of settlements, the daily
humiliation of Palestinians by Israeli forces, and the targeting of
Israeli civilians by Palestinian suicide bombers. Though these phenomena
are generally seen through a political lens, they are all also human
rights violations.

It is rare to see the statistic I have cited above: over 3,800 people
killed as a direct result of this conflict since September 2000. Most
casualty statistics perpetuate a zero-sum mentality that compares
Palestinian and Israeli deaths. This macabre accounting of how many have
been killed on ""my"" side versus ""your"" side stands in stark contrast to
the most basic tenet of human rights: the idea that every human being
has equal rights, and that the life of a Palestinian child, for example,
is of equal worth to the life of an Israeli child.

Recognition of the universality of human rights, however, does not
obscure the fundamental asymmetry of this conflict. Israel maintains a
military occupation over some 3.6 million Palestinians with an
apartheid-like separation of Jews and Palestinians, whereby one's
rights, benefits and access to resources are determined by one's
national identity. This is not to say that Israelis are not victims of
human rights violations as well. Indeed, the targeted attacks on Israeli
civilians are almost universally recognized as war crimes. However,
Israeli organizations like B'Tselem focus on the actions of their own
government, and their government systematically violates Palestinian
rights, while devoting enormous resources to protect Israelis. Thus
Israeli organizations are in the unique position of defending the human
rights of ""the other"" or even the enemy in this conflict.

It is clear that we will never enjoy full human rights in a situation of
occupation and conflict, and therefore resolution of the conflict is
essential to protecting human rights. This does not mean that there is
an easy symbiosis between human rights and conflict resolution. In fact,
human rights violations are as frequently justified in the name of
conflict resolution as they are by the conflict itself. Governments on
the left and the right have persecuted the ""opponents of peace,"" placing
detractors in administrative detention, torturing them and deporting
them. One of the primary roles of the human rights community is to state
unequivocally that the ends cannot justify the means. Not even the lofty
goal of resolving this conflict and bringing peace to Israelis and
Palestinians can justify violation of fundamental human rights.

Human rights organizations must be actively involved in resolving this
conflict. Though we do not take a position on political issues, any
diplomatic solution must also accord with all sides' legal obligations.
There is a utilitarian reason to include human rights in conflict
resolution: we learned from the Oslo process that a peace process that
ignores human rights violations is vulnerable at its core, perhaps even
doomed to failure. Yet human rights are also a moral imperative
regardless of their utilitarian merits.

It is therefore a mistake for diplomatic initiatives like the roadmap to
treat a settlement freeze, an end to house demolitions or lifting the
siege on Palestinian communities solely as confidence-building measures.
These are legal obligations that Israel must uphold regardless of any
progress in negotiations.

The same is true of the separation barrier, Palestinian refugees,
Israeli settlements and the future status of Jerusalem - all these must
be understood not only as political issues, but also as issues
implicating legal obligations that must be respected. Just as human
rights violations are a cause of conflict, no conflict can be
successfully resolved without taking human rights and international
humanitarian law into account.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: Would you say that there is a greater and greater
disconnect between international law and the implementation of such law
on the ground, most recently with regard to the wall?

A: The Israeli occupation has always brought with it a violation
of human rights if we look at the standard that should be but is not
implemented: international law and international humanitarian law. You
can give many examples of this, and one recent example is the wall.
Israel has said it will not implement or take notice of the Hague
decision or the United Nations General Assembly recommendation.

We feel, and this is always a worry to us as human rights activists,
that politics interferes with the implementation of human rights and
those who have the power can implement or not implement international
law as they see fit. In addition, what we notice now is that some
powerful countries like the United States want to make changes to
international law.

Q: What can human rights groups like your own do about
that, if the powerful are intent on having their way?

A: Of course we understand that the struggle for human rights is
a long struggle. Human rights activists mainly try to lobby and
influence international public opinion. International law came about
after World War I and II as a result of people's reaction to the mass
violations of human rights these wars embodied. So this is the main way
human rights activists can be effective, and we hope that through such
methods we can affect changes in international public opinion. And we
are somehow optimistic, because we notice that there are changes in
international opinion.

Q: How would you characterize the trend in human rights in
the past four years, both internally and vis-a-vis the occupation?

A:* Violations of human rights as a result of the occupation have
reached unprecedented levels. We are now talking about mass collective
punishments, including the checkpoints that restrict the right of
movement and the rights of people to access their places of work or
their land, as well as restrictions on the access to water. These
measures have affected the lives of all Palestinians. In addition there
are the assassinations, the demolition of houses, the continued
settlement building and lately, and another thing that has affected the
lives of all Palestinians, the building of the wall. All of this is
prohibited by international law. What we see is that all these
violations have continued and increased.

In addition, we notice that within the so-called peace process, the
security issue has become the overriding issue, and an issue at odds
with the human rights issue, which makes us worry about the prevalent
view about how to deal with the situation.

Within Palestinian society there are also violations. We monitor the
violations of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), which is why as
an organization when we talk about violations we also take into
consideration violations of the Authority. Before the Intifada there
were mass arrests and torture. Now there is no rule of law and without
the rule of law nothing can be implemented. There is a lot of discussion
and lobbying within the Palestinian community at the moment about
elections, because we believe that holding elections is one of the
important mechanisms to make changes within Palestinian society and to
ensure accountability. But we also notice that both internally and
internationally there is no pressure to ensure this process, while for
other issues, like security, there is a lot of pressure.

Q: Your organization deals with prisoners' rights. What is
the current status of prisoners' rights?

A: There is constant violation of conventions regarding
prisoners. I will not talk politically here; I will talk only about the
rights of prisoners according to minimum international standards. There
are numerous Israeli violations of these standards, including the
provision of adequate healthcare, the number of prisoners per cell, the
standard of food, and so on. Even though the Israel High Court in 1999
ruled that the use of torture should be stopped, we see that torture
continues being used. Prisoners are held in isolation for long stretches
and lawyers are not allowed access, which is a grievous violation.
Israeli organizations monitoring prisoner rights abuses last May issued
a report detailing violations not only of international standards but
also Israeli standards, and this is why there is now a case before the
Israeli high court, and there is discussion in the Israeli Knesset.
Yesterday a Knesset committee went to one prison to talk to prisoners.
This comes after much pressure from within Israel over the violation of
prisoners' rights.

We will continue our monitoring work and submit our reports to the UN
and other international bodies in coordination with international human
rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as
well as other Palestinian human rights groups, to lobby against these
violations and improve the situation inside prisons.
"
"Isr","Neut","Today, the political timetable of elections in the United States, Israel
and the Palestinian Authority is dictating the nature of attempts to
stabilize the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation and to renew the peace
process.

Elections influenced the peace process in the past, too. The best
example is the postponement of the Israeli withdrawal from Hebron
decided upon by the Peres government on the eve of the 1996 elections.
The Taba talks held shortly before prime ministerial elections in 2001
were a last minute attempt to offer concessions to the Palestinians in
order to strengthen Ehud Barak's chances among left-wing voters and with
Arab voters who boycotted the elections.

Today the influence of elections on the peace process is evident long
before election day. And a combination of political constraints felt by
the three main actors in the arena is paralyzing the peace process.

The American administration's activities in the Middle East are heavily
influenced by US election considerations. The Republicans need Jewish
voters and contributors for the November 2002 midterm elections.
President George W. Bush has no desire to enter into a dispute with
Israel when polls show a rise in Jewish support for the Republicans
during his tenure.

When the leaders of Egypt and Saudi Arabia presented Bush with their
peace program, they took into account the ""Jewish factor."" They proposed
declaring an interim Palestinian state after the upcoming congressional
elections, while postponing a permanent status agreement until after the
November 2004 presidential elections--when, they assumed, a second term
president would be unencumbered by fears of Jewish retribution at the
polls. Bush adopted part of their advice, and in his speech of June 24
proposed that a permanent status agreement be completed within three
years, i.e., safely into his second term. Nor is the administration's
growing involvement with a war against Iraq devoid of considerations
involving the upcoming elections and the Republicans' desire to divert
the public debate from economic problems to the war against terrorism.

In Israel we cannot know whether the current government will survive
through to the completion of its term on October 28, 2003, or will hold
early elections in the spring, or even in January. Against this
uncertain background, preparations for primaries have begun in the Labor
Party and the Likud. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, under pressure from
his rival Binyamin Netanyahu, has been moving to the right; he no longer
talks about a Palestinian state as he did last summer. In the Labor
Party the dynamic is the opposite: party Chairman Binyamin Ben Eliezer
has been obliged to move to the left by building a separation fence (to
neutralize one rival, Haim Ramon) and engineering a local ceasefire and
removing settlement outposts (against his new rival, Amram Mitzna).

Sharon is well aware of the influence of the ballot box on diplomacy. In
his dealings with the US administration prior to the Bush speech of June
2002, he threatened to invoke his ""doomsday weapon"": early elections.
""Of course I'll be reelected, but first we'll have six months of
paralysis,"" he warned senior administration officials. The same tactic,
only in reverse, is being invoked by Sharon's bitter enemy, Palestinian
Authority Chairman Yasir Arafat. The Palestinian leader wants to use the
ballot box to maneuver his way out of the international isolation that
Bush and Sharon have imposed on him. Arafat and his entourage have
decided on new elections for the PA on January 15, 2003, based on the
Oslo formula. Under current circumstances, Arafat is expected to win a
new mandate from the public that will oblige his supporters in Europe to
lend him a helping hand.

This is why there is no enthusiasm in Israel for Palestinian elections.
Sharon sees them as a trick to keep Arafat in power, while Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres warns that the extreme positions the candidates
will feel obliged to invoke will simply perpetuate the conflict. The
Israel Defense Forces? Planning Branch assesses that Palestinian
elections will not take place before the end of 2003. This assessment
was presented to the political echelon, and corresponds perfectly with
the government's own constraints: the Palestinians will only vote after
elections in Israel, and the decision regarding an IDF withdrawal from
the PA in order to facilitate elections will fall upon the next government.

The US administration proposed a compromise: elections in the spring of
2003, after the Palestinian election law is changed and reforms are
introduced that place a ""prime minister"" at the top of the PA pyramid
and relegate Arafat to symbolic status. The main inducement for
Palestinians is IDF withdrawal from their lands. But the current PA
leadership, which does not want to commit political suicide, frowns upon
the idea; nor is the extent of American determination clear.

When the leaders are busy with domestic constraints there is little
likelihood of advancing the process. It seems probable that the
stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian process will prevail at least until
elections in Israel, or until the war in Iraq, which itself is not
divorced from the electoral timetable. The anticipation of an American
offensive that is liable to provoke Iraqi missile attacks on Israel
tends to strengthen the cohesiveness of the Israeli government, and
reduces the chances of early elections. And all this guarantees a
prolonged period of political ""treading water"".
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: A new draft elections law was crafted recently for the
Palestinian Legislative Council. What are the features of that draft?

A: This new draft law is concerned with the general context and
the developments that have occurred on the ground. As such, the proposed
draft allows the Legislative Council to enter the coming elections in
the context of numerous perspectives--Palestinian, Israeli and
international.

Previous experiences were evaluated in order to address the obstacles
facing the PLC resulting from the electoral system and the old elections
law (Law Number 13, 1995), which was the basis for the 1996 elections.
That [law], especially the elections protocol (Appendix Two in the
agreements signed on September 28, 1995 in Washington), emphasized
Palestinian-Israeli agreements.

Q: Why have these changes been proposed at this
particular time? Are there problems with the old law, or does this
relate to developments on the ground?

A: The new legal situation led us to review some of the old
clauses, which eventually led to the presentation of a completely new
draft law. The PLC approved that draft law during its session on Sunday,
September 1 after a general reading, and then it was transferred to the
Legal Committee for preparation for the first reading.

The impetus for this draft was that the old elections statute was based
on a system of lists of individual nominations, and open lists, and
immediate election for any number [of candidates] within the set
ceiling. The nominees with the most votes won.

The new statute, however, is based on relative representation for lists
of parties and blocs. This will encourage political activity and
increase the importance of political parties in the PLC. This is
necessary in order to transfer the mechanisms of revolution into that of
civil society based on pluralism and political parties. It also requires
the holding of regular elections every four years, contrary to the old
law that tied the Council's term to the interim period [of
Palestinian-Israeli agreements].

Q: Is it possible to hold elections, even if the proposed
draft of the new law is approved, in light of the developments on the
ground?

A: Even before September 28, 2000 and the outbreak of the Al Aqsa
Intifada and the beginning of the comprehensive Israeli aggressions
against the Palestinian people, the authority and their institutions,
Palestinian elections were a public demand--even as the Palestinian
Authority was procrastinating on holding public elections. There was a
mentality in the leadership that didn't believe in institutionalized
work. Rather, it held the conviction that direct administration of this
""project"" would strengthen its power over the political system.

Since the Intifada, however, and with the new, dangerous developments of
the last two years, there are other parties that now have a relationship
and an opinion on these things. These changes have altered the
priorities of the average citizen.

Q: How does the involvement of parties other than
Palestinians affect the elections process?

A: Today the elections are seen as an instrument in the process of
struggle, and not as an end in themselves.

Israel, represented by its prime minister, looks at the Palestinian
elections as a means of ending the Palestinian Authority and the
resistance and erasing the Oslo Accords and abrogating them. Ariel
Sharon does not hide his animosity to these agreements, but for reasons
of international public opinion he does not announce his position
frankly--but he is quite active on the ground.

Sharon is floundering between two positions: allowing the holding of
elections and how to deal with them if they are held. If he were to
reveal his position, he would be forced to accept their results,
including the reelection of [Palestinian President Yasser] Arafat. If he
refuses, the changes in the elections law will force him to negotiate
with the Authority and that will not be acceptable to him.

Q: How is the international community involved in the
elections process?

A: International involvement in these elections led by the United
States via the Quartet, sees these elections as one way to get rid of
Arafat. They are demanding that the law or constitution be changed
before the elections are held in order to guarantee Arafat's
transformation into a mere symbolic figure, or he is pushed out of the
Authority altogether.

The international community sees the proposed elections as a mechanism
for bridging the time period set in US President Bush's speech for
creating a Palestinian state by 2005. In this context, the European
initiative presented by Denmark ties the current situation to the coming
three years, after which time a Palestinian state can be created.

The Palestinian view of the elections, both popular and official, would
be accepting of ""reform"" if it were not for Israeli and American
interventions. These interventions drive the Palestinian public to
support the Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat. It sees these
elections as an opportunity to renew the legitimacy of Arafat and
reelect him.

Moreover, the holding of elections in accordance with the old rules
requires an Israeli withdrawal from all the areas it has occupied, which
will help the Palestinians to make use of international monitors.
Palestinians see, in the idea of offering all Palestinians the right to
elections, a means of facilitating their rights to the ground on which
they stand and strengthening the concepts of independence and
self-determination.
"
"Isr","Neut","Negotiations are a process of mutual mapping, in which each of the sides
maps out the positions of the other, and tries to understand what might
be acceptable or unacceptable to it. Agreement becomes possible when
both sides succeed, through the mapping process, in formulating a
settlement that provides a solution equally beneficial to the vital
interests of each.

One of the principal reasons for the difficulties encountered by the
Oslo process from its inception was the failure of both sides to
comprehend one another's sensitivities. This failure contributed heavily
to the deep lack of trust between them. It helped bring about the
breakdown of the Camp David Summit, and the collapse of the entire
process in its aftermath.

Meanwhile contacts continue between Israelis and Palestinians,
particularly in informal tracks. Here the Israeli participants have
taken note that the Palestinians still entertain certain basic
misunderstandings concerning the sensitivities and ""red lines"" of
Israelis. Sometimes one has to wonder whether Israelis and Palestinians
are even speaking the same language (even when they are indeed both
speaking the same language, i.e., English, Hebrew or Arabic).

The first thing the Palestinians have difficulty understanding is that
each of the parties has its own narrative, and each is different from
the other. There is no chance whatsoever that Israelis will accept the
Palestinian narrative regarding the creation of the State of Israel and
the definition of justice that derives from it, and will agree that this
form the basis for defining the relationship between the two sides. Each
party has its own definition of justice. In the eyes of the Israeli
side, a fair settlement should provide a reasonable solution for the
vital needs of both parties; questions of narrative and historical
justice should be left to the historians.

Palestinians do not sufficiently understand Israelis' sense of
existential threat and vulnerability, among other reasons due to
Israel's image as a regional power. They don't appreciate the way this
sense of threat contributes to the perception of many Israelis that
issues like the refugees or, in the Palestinian term, the ""right of
return,"" are existential threats to Israel. Nor do Palestinians
understand that it is Israeli threat perceptions that inform Israeli
security demands, and not some Israeli plot to ""withdraw"" ostensibly
from the occupied territories while in fact ""staying"".

Palestinian violence was a pernicious phenomenon throughout the Oslo
process, and to a large extent precipitated its failure. The
Palestinians never comprehended the depth of influence of Palestinian
violence on the Israeli perception of the chances of reaching a peaceful
settlement with them. Of course they understood that Israelis do not
want Palestinian violence, but they still thought of it as a tool that
could be employed or withdrawn at their whim, and ignored the malignant
effect of this behavior on Israeli thinking.

This misperception is linked to Palestinians' lack of understanding of
the difference in approach between themselves and Israel regarding the
nature of agreements. The Israeli approach is juridical, sticks closely
to the literal wording of the agreement, and insists on its execution to
the letter. Not infrequently the Palestinians pursue ambiguous or
equivocal wording that enables them to act in one way while representing
that they are doing the opposite, or to present an interpretation
favorable to their interests at a later juncture. To this we must add a
generally lenient approach to the very existence of agreements. This
misunderstanding has caused additional damage to Israeli trust in
Palestinians.

Note the difference in the attitude of Israelis toward Syria and the
Palestinians. Israelis have no particular affection for Syria, but they
respect that country for the way it honors the agreements it has signed.

The refugee issue provides an excellent illustration of the
misunderstandings surveyed thus far, insofar as even today they all find
expression in Palestinian positions:

    * The Palestinians insist that Israel accept their narrative and
      recognize the right of return, even if it is not actually applied.

    * They do not comprehend that in the Israeli perception even a
      feeble possibility of the return of refugees is an existential threat.

    * They do not understand the effect of the violence invoked by
      Israeli Arabs in October 2000 on the Israeli perception of the
      refugee issue.

    * In conversations with them, they are prepared to acknowledge that
      the refugees will in the end not return to Israel, but do not
      agree that this be detailed explicitly in an agreement. When the
      Israeli side argues that what they are proposing is not strong
      enough, and leaves an opening for the return of refugees, they
      offer answers that reflect their general approach toward
      agreements: it's not important, in reality no one will want to
return, and the like.

This article focused on Palestinian misunderstandings. But it recognizes
that similar misunderstandings regarding Palestinian sensitivities also
exist among Israelis.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What do you think is the key factor that Israelis do not
understand about Palestinians?

A: I think that there are two types of fundamental things. One is
that they don't understand what we want and what we are upset about. The
other thing is that they don't really understand how we live. Because
they don't understand the latter, they can't really understand the former.

It seems so incredible to us, but it is true: most Israelis don't
understand that all we want is an end to the occupation. No matter what
we do, that message does not seem to sink in. They don't believe that in
our heart of hearts, we have given up on all of historic Palestine.

There is a difference between knowing and belief. Israelis never really
believed that we accepted the two-state solution. It seems a little bit
crazy--why would anyone accept to take only part of what was originally
theirs? They don't believe that deeply and profoundly the vast majority
of Palestinians solely want the end of the occupation and have
emotionally let go of the hope of getting back historic Palestine.

Second, Israelis don't know what our everyday reality is and haven't
known for some time. They didn't know it all though Oslo, the interim
period, and that is why they couldn't understand the Intifada. They
really believed that everything was getting better for us and things
were moving forward.

We find it astounding that they don't know what curfew and closure is.
They vaguely see it on the news, but they actually have no idea what our
everyday reality is like. I find this often from talking to Israelis.
What is even more stunning is when this comes from Israelis who care and
are involved.

Q: Can you give an example?

A: I remember taking a long-term Israeli peace activist to see the
settlements around Jerusalem. She was completely shocked. She said, ""I
don't really want to see them, because they upset me."" Well, if you get
that from activists, then you know that the vast majority doesn't really
want to know.

This happens in most situations of colonialism and national and ethnic
conflict; the dominant group does not want to face what they are doing
to the dominated group. Therefore, it is that much harder for Israelis
to understand why we are so enraged that we made a massive
compromise--accepting only 22 percent [of historic Palestine]--and that
was not good enough for them.

Q: What do you think is the result of these misunderstandings?

A: I put most of the blame for the situation we are in on the past
Labor government. [Former Prime Minister Ehud] Barak and [foreign
minister Shlomo] Ben Ami were founder and creator of all the lies that
[Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon was then able to use.

Now Israelis have this fear and paranoia that we don't want peace and
that we want to destroy them, which allowed Sharon to be elected. All of
the incredible sense of betrayal that Palestinians felt over the peace
process is now buried under the ""fact"" that we are all somehow
terrorists and want to destroy Israel. This right-wing government is
using this as a cover to undo us, to destroy the Palestinian Authority,
to send the whole Palestinian national project back into oblivion.

Q: There are those who believe that the mask will soon fall
away, that there will be a recognition of how close things were and then
there will be a deal. What do you see happening?

A: I think that the mask always gets taken off much too late. Look
at America's ""dirty tricks"" in Central America and Vietnam and
Iran-Contra. The truth comes out when it has no power to change things
anymore.

What I do think is that this sort of slow exhaustion and breaking down
of both societies is going to eventually lead to a point--I don't know
when--where we will have to find a technical solution. This will
probably be in the form of unilateral separation.

This is one of the things that we Palestinians cannot completely see:
this situation is very traumatic for Israelis and they would like an
exit. But it will not be an exit of discovery. I wish. But I don't think
it will be.
"
"Isr","Neut","""Transfer"", proclaim the banners of the opponents of uprooting the
settlements in the Gaza Strip and northern Samaria, ""will not happen"".
And passers-by around the country say to themselves that somewhere in
the back of their minds they remember that formula, ""transfer will not
happen"". Then they recall: the slogan was composed and distributed
throughout the country about 20 years ago by the left wing, which took
seriously the threats of Rabbi Meir Kahane, leader of the Kach movement,
to expel (""transfer"") the Arabs of Israel and the Palestinians in the
territories to Arab countries.

The term ""transfer"" became one of the most repulsive in Israeli
political and moral culture. So repulsive that Yossi Sarid, for example,
stated that his movement would call upon soldiers to disobey orders to
carry out transfer, even if this meant discord within the army. The
author Amos Oz said that in the event of transfer, all the bridges
leading to the country designated to absorb the transferees should be
blown up.

The settlers have clearly not succeeded in generating the same deterrent
effect, the same sense of taboo, with regard to the uprooting of Jews as
did the left when it was a question of uprooting Arabs. This is
undoubtedly because the vast majority of the media and academia opposed
the expulsion of Arabs then, and supports the expulsion of Jews now. But
there is more. After four years of a cruel terrorist war the Israeli
public is very, very tired. It is prepared to pay heavily, to the extent
of uprooting thousands of Jews from their homes, in return for the
illusion that now it will enjoy a little peace and quiet.

The method that the settlers and their supporters hope to employ in the
course of 2005 in order to lift this evil decree is the referendum. They
seek to repeat, this time among the entire electorate, the precedent of
the vote among Likud members: about half a year ago the settlers turned
a deficit of 20 percent in the opinion polls into a victory by more than
20 percent in the actual Likud referendum. Without the Arab vote, they
argue, there is no majority favoring uprooting settlements. With hard
work, they believe, a referendum can be won.

A week ago, Pinchas Wallerstein, a settler leader, stated that if there
is no referendum, the alternative is non-violent civil disobedience,
including a readiness to go to jail. The response was overwhelming:
spontaneous demonstrations and hundreds of declarations of support by
telephone, SMS and email. His fellow members of the Council of Settlers
in Judea, Samaria and Gaza (""Yesha Council""), surprised by the extent of
support and recognizing that the popular enthusiasm was authentic,
hastened to join him.

In the media and the political establishment, on the other hand, the
reaction was anger. The attorney general even held a special night-time
session with his fellow advocates to consider what legal steps to take
against Wallerstein--which in turn only enhanced the latter's prestige
among his followers.

To summarize, this will more or less be the settlers' strategy in 2005:
massive but not violent resistance to attempts to uproot them, along the
Ukrainian model. True, the media, which in Ukraine played a key role in
the victory over the government, supports the government in Israel. But
as Wallerstein notes, we are used to confronting hostile media.

Yet the most effective means of stopping the uprooting is liable to be
one the settler leadership in fact rejects in principle: a refusal on
the part of soldiers to obey disengagement orders.

A large percentage of the Israel Defense Force's combat soldiers come
from the religious and settler communities. Many of their spiritual
teachers, the rabbis, are telling them that an order to uproot Jews is
illegal. The soldiers from the development towns, too, are
unenthusiastic, to say the least, about participating in disengagement.
All these soldiers argue that they volunteered for combat units in order
to fight the enemy, not their own people. Together, these two elements
constitute some 60 percent of the combat troops and 70 percent of the
junior officers.

The army leadership, placed in this dilemma, this week met with the
settler leaders and called upon them to take unequivocal action to
prevent soldiers from refusing orders. The settlers replied that when
more than 5,000 soldiers have already dared to sign petitions declaring
they will refuse, and when many more, particularly officers, fear to
sign, the problem is no longer that of the settlers, but rather of the
government and the army. ""This is an edict,"" they stated, echoing an old
Jewish saying, ""that the public cannot sustain"".

The only way to prevent a major clash between the settlers and their
supporters and the government in 2005 is, as the settlers demand, a
referendum--or elections. If Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his
supporters are so certain that the majority supports them, why don't
they adopt this approach, if only to prevent a schism among the people
and the army?
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: You are in Rafah. What do you think will happen there in
2005?

A: Rafah has been living in extraordinarily difficult
circumstances in the last four years. All of Rafah, whether houses,
agriculture, trees, land, has been destroyed by the Israeli occupation.
I think... I hope, that 2005 will give us an opportunity to live. We
need to rebuild Rafah. We need 2,500 new houses, we need to replant
trees and re-cultivate the land that has been leveled. Everything needs
to be rebuilt in Rafah, from the infrastructure to the social and
economic life. I think this year will provide us some hope for life in
Rafah and the future, actually, some hope that we may arrive at the
beginning of peace.

Q: What makes you so hopeful?

A: My hope springs from the fact that we begin the year with
elections, and all Palestinians will share in electing a new president.
This gives me hope. This is the beginning of the way forward for all
Palestinians.

Q: How does the Israeli withdrawal plan from Gaza fit into
this? Will it happen and if it does, is it a good thing?

A: I think the Israeli occupation will end in Gaza. This is
what they've said, and I think the unity government with Sharon and
Peres is meant to ensure that this withdrawal happens?

Q: But is a unilateral withdrawal good for you?

A: I hope that there will be agreement between the PA and
Israel. But even if not, the PA will still be able to control everything
in the Strip. The authority is ready and able to take control. I think
the first thing Abu Mazen will do if he is elected president is to
initiate talks with all the Palestinian factions, especially Hamas and
Islamic Jihad, to this end.

Q: And will these talks be successful?

A: I think the talks will succeed. I think Palestinians are
eager for the factions to work together and for us to show the world
that we can take control of our own affairs.

Q: Last year was a difficult year for Fateh. How do you see
the year ahead for the movement?

A: 2005 should see elections in Fateh, in addition to the
elections in the municipalities and for the Legislative Council. All of
these are important to rebuild our social and economic lives, to plan
for the future. In Fateh it is important to hold elections, sooner
rather than later, to also establish the program for the future.

It is important for Fateh, like it is in all the factions, for the young
generation to start assuming positions of leadership. That is the best
way to prepare for the future, and that is what the Fateh conference
should provide us.
"
"Isr","Neut","Ariel Sharon's victory in the Knesset elections at the head of the Likud
list gives him something that belies the familiar cliche: a second
chance to leave a first impression. Until now he headed a government
based on a Knesset that was elected along with Ehud Barak. Now he's
finally alone at the top, his responsibility as unequivocal as the test
he faces.

Within the endless tension between reality and aspiration, Sharon
emerges at the pragmatic, prudent pole. He may not have abandoned the
caprice of holding onto most of the settlements and the territory in the
West Bank, but his ardor runs headlong into cooler calculations
regarding what President George W. Bush will permit him to do. This is
not necessarily ""statesmanship""--it's sufficient to consider it
survivorship. Sharon cannot allow himself to get on a collision track
with Bush that would put an end to his government and his own political
career. Early elections yet again, and this time against a backdrop
antithetical to that of the January 2003 elections, meaning in an
atmosphere of hostility rather than love between Bush and Sharon, will
send Sharon into retirement at Sycamore Ranch. The Israeli voter,
whatever his considered judgment regarding the issue of ""territories for
peace,"" is not inclined to applaud his/her leaders when they lose favor
with the White House.

This was plainly evident over the past three months, following the
resignation of Binyamin Ben Eliezer and the other Labor ministers.
Sharon preferred to hold early elections rather than set up a narrow
based government dependent on Avigdor Lieberman. True, he was also
influenced by calculations regarding the internal contest with
Netanyahu, Lieberman's ally (it's sufficient to recall Sharon's panicky
reaction on the day of the Likud primary, following the attacks in
Mombasa and Bet Shean, to appreciate just how central those calculations
were in his thinking). Nevertheless he was never tempted to abandon his
readiness to establish a Palestinian state--not one that's fully
sovereign, not a state within borders acceptable to the Palestinians and
their supporters, yet still breaking the taboo and blatantly defying
Netanyahu, Lieberman and that portion of the Israeli public (apparently
one quarter or less, but a much stronger proportion within the Likud)
that is closer than Sharon to the extreme right.

Sharon has turned the Bush vision, as expressed in the president's June
24, 2002 speech, into one of his holy writs. This is the written law.
Its exegesis, the oral law (particularly the State Department's ""road
map""), is subject to discussion and improvement. The practical
significance of the Bush vision is simple: the Palestinian state will be
established by the year 2005, but first comes 2004 (the year of Bush's
reelection, along with congressional elections where Bush hopes to
preserve the Republicans' fragile majority) and the disappearance, in
real or at least political terms, of two negative regional
forces--Saddam Hussein and Yasir Arafat.

Without them there will emerge a new regional order. Jordan will be
freed of Iraqi pressure on the east and Palestinian pressure on the
west; and a Palestine without Arafat and with a new leadership (whose
central figures were not disqualified by Sharon even five years ago,
during the Netanyahu government) that recognizes the failure of
terrorism, will constitute an acceptable formula. Arafat no, Palestine yes.

This is more or less what the Planning Branch in Israel Defense Forces
General Staff Headquarters proposed to Sharon in late July 2002: hang
tough, wait until Arafat departs the scene, until Saddam is gone and
until a separation fence is built between the West Bank and Israel
proper. This can be seen as an extension of Sharon's agreement to the
Mitchell Commission Report, to his statement on the night of the
Dolphinarium bombing that ""restraint is strength,"" to the positions he
took regarding the mediation missions of George Tenet and Anthony Zinni.
In all these instances Sharon behaved as if compelled by his
governmental partnership with Labor. Yet even after its dissolution he
did not abandon this line--not even to fulfill his declared desire to
expel Arafat.

Sharon's efforts to bring Labor back into his government, a centrist
government without right or left wings, reflect his intention to adhere
to a policy that will consummate the Bush vision. And the extent of
Bush's tenacity in translating his vision into reality will determine
just how far Sharon goes.
"
"Pal","Neut","Despite predictions that Ariel Sharon would win the Israeli elections,
his sweeping victory has resonated loudly in various Palestinian
sectors. Certainly, there is a compelling need to understand the
relationship between this cause and effect: why did Sharon win the
elections and what forces are driving the Israeli electorate?

The percentage of Israeli human losses as compared to Palestinian losses
were at their highest under the Sharon regime. The ratio of Israeli to
Palestinian deaths has narrowed considerably under Sharon to one Israeli
death for every three Palestinian dead, while under his predecessor Ehud
Barak, the ratio was one to ten, and under Benjamin Netanyahu the ratio
was one to fifteen. Understanding Sharon's success despite this
phenomenon is compelling.

There are two Palestinian schools of thought that attempt to explain the
current rise of Sharonism. The first school suggests that the
militarization of the intifada is the central cause for Sharon's
landslide return to head the Israeli government. By this reasoning, the
heightened Palestinian resistance has only caused tremendous damage to
Palestinians themselves by extracting painful Israeli military reactions
and by pushing many Israelis to extremism.

Accordingly, members of this school of thought have expended great
efforts to limit the resistance so that it does not include Israeli
civilians. They have also signaled the possibility of offering the
Sharon government a year or several months of calm. These individuals
advocate pulling the rug out from Sharon's feet and not giving him cause
to do more damage to Palestinian society.

From the beginning, this school of thought saw the intifada as posing a
serious threat to its platform and negotiating programs. As such, its
advocates have worked tirelessly to keep matters under their control and
to utilize the Palestinian intifada only as an instrument for restarting
talks. They see the continuation of resistance as a worrisome and
dangerous matter. Indeed, inside this school, there are voices saying
that even if Sharon intensifies his barbaric attacks, Palestinians must
remain idle and win the battle through their blood. These thinkers
believe that Palestinians must rescue what is rescuable at this stage.

There is, of course, an opposing school of thought with different
analyses and solutions. This school of thought has sat by and watched
the slow nature of the peace process for many years and has come,
therefore, to see the intifada and its resistance as a process of
national liberation, rather than an instrument for restarting the
political process. These individuals see the intifada as a process of
expunging the occupation and arriving finally at independence. They see
the static regional context as having actually become a pillar of
support for the occupation in Israel's unjust war. This school also
blames the Israeli left for ""beautifying"" Israeli occupation, and
accuses it of creating the atmosphere necessary for the collapse of the
political process and the entry of Sharon.

This school does not blame the resistance for Sharon's success, despite
that he has smashed the rule that Israeli leaders measure success in
their ability to provide security for the Israeli people. Rather, it
believes that there are other underlying causes for the current
environment, most important of which is the absence of the Israeli left
over the last two and a half years.

There are two very critical strategic dangers for Palestinian society in
the foreseeable future. The foremost danger is the threat that Sharon
poses to the symbol of Palestinian nationalism, i.e., President Yasser
Arafat. Sharon has made no secret of his hatred for the Palestinian
leader. Unless the symbol of nationalism is defended and protected by
Palestinians themselves, he could be in imminent danger.

The second critical danger is Sharon's determined effort to crush the
Palestinian intifada, which means more assassinations, incarcerations,
starvation and occupation of the Palestinian people. The strategic
danger here lies in the fact that if pushed to its logical conclusions,
this state of affairs might in the end sway some Palestinians to opt for
a negotiated process in the absence of the intifada (i.e., the first
school of thought would force through a meaningless political process).

It is my view that, whether Sharon forms a national unity government or
an exclusively rightist government, the content of this next chapter in
his political life (likely his last) will not differ dramatically.
Sharon is determined to administer the conflict with the Palestinians by
relying first and foremost on his military machine and not on
negotiations. Irrespective of his coalition partners, Sharon has
obtained for his party one third of the seats in the Israeli Knesset and
it is quite natural, then, for him to feel victorious and press ahead.

The best protection against this danger is to protect the scope of
resistance, while arming it with a clear-cut political program that all
Israelis, leftists and rightists, are made aware of. Every Israeli must
understand that the Palestinian goal is to end the occupation and that
the security of every Israeli is inexorably linked to the security of
every Palestinian.

It is impossible to overemphasize the extent of the calamity upon us.
Unless this situation is dealt with in creative ways, then we may find
that we have returned to being the hostages of Israeli rightist
positions--not for years to come, but for perhaps decades. The only way
to escape is if a balance is maintained between the intifada and
diplomacy. It is said that diplomacy without power is like music without
instruments. Neither should come at the expense of the other.
Palestinian society is well accustomed to internal debate, but the
sooner we can arrive at this balance, the better. I believe that
eventually, that recognition will come--the question is whether it will
come too late.
"
"Isr","Neut","During the Oslo process the Palestinians missed an opportunity to alter
the pattern of reciprocal relations when they fundamentally violated the
agreements they had signed with Israel, particularly by invoking force
against Israelis. The basic assumptions for an improvement of relations
between the sides are:

1. A political process must be initiated in stages, since the attempt to
reach a comprehensive agreement has failed and cannot be revived,
certainly not on the basis of the Clinton principles. The Israeli public
is today not prepared to take the risks and to make the concessions that
it might have made in the summer of 2000. Accordingly, the right way is
a ""roadmap"" that comprises an incremental approach, proceeding step by
step over considerable time along a predetermined route.

2. One precondition for any progress is the removal or neutralization of
Yasir Arafat. His leadership has brought disaster to his people and
generated total mistrust among Israelis, Americans and other
international actors. His ongoing presence will impede the emergence of
an alternative Palestinian leadership--a complex and prolonged process.

3. The primary test of the new leadership will be the courage to create
a monopoly on the use of force within the Palestinian Authority (PA),
even at the cost of civil war. The primary lesson of the failure of the
Oslo process is that the PA is incapable of constituting a partner in a
peace process unless it centralizes control over all armed forces.

4. An additional lesson of the Oslo process is the necessity of
verifying the fulfillment of all obligations prior to advancing to the
next phase of the roadmap.

5. The roadmap timetable will be determined primarily by the capacity of
the Palestinians to act efficiently against armed groups that do not
accept the decisions of the leadership.

6. On the Israeli side there must be a clear and demonstrated readiness
for a territorial compromise that includes the dismantling of a number
of settlements. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, many elements within the
Likud, and the new government clearly fulfill this condition.

The ""roadmap"" has two operative objectives. The first is a gradual
return to the situation that prevailed prior to the outburst of a wave
of terrorism in September 2000, i.e., to Palestinian rule over the
cities. The second is the signing of a long-term (15-20 years) interim
agreement, with negotiations over remaining areas of dispute commencing
toward its completion.

Achieving the first objective depends on adopting the model prevailing
in Jericho. That town is under Palestinian rule because it does not
constitute a base or infrastructure for terrorist activity against
Israeli targets. There have also been attempts to transfer
responsibility over Bethlehem and Hebron to the Palestinian Authority,
but the Palestinians were not able to maintain the peace. The Jericho
precedent demonstrates that the Palestinians have the capacity to
prevent terrorism. The transfer of additional territory is dependent on
similar results. In parallel, Israel must provide access to its job
market and take additional economic steps to improve the Palestinians'
situation, particularly in areas returned to Palestinian rule. Effective
control by the PA for several months over territory restored to its
security and civil control is a precondition for the transfer of
additional territory. It may be possible to complete this phase within
two years from start to finish.

One year after the PA has centralized control over its security
apparatus and proven its effectiveness in preventing terrorism--in
effect, fundamentally altered its nature--it will be possible to enter
negotiations regarding an interim agreement. The objective of the
interim agreement is to create a new reality, whereby friction between
the Palestinian and Israeli populations is minimized, while Israel
retains territorial assets that can be delivered to the Palestinians
under final status. Shortly after signing the interim agreement Israel
will transfer additional territory to the PA and remove several isolated
settlements.

During the period of the interim agreement the PA can be granted symbols
of sovereignty such as a national currency and/or full membership in
international organizations. In practice its sovereignty will be limited
by Israeli control over border crossings and strict arms control
measures. There may be room to involve Jordan in arrangements in the
West Bank and Egypt in Gaza. In the course of the interim agreement the
PA must revise its textbooks and begin teaching subjects like democracy
and respect for the historic and religious rights of the Jews in the
Land of Israel.

The geographic profile of the proposed final status corresponds with the
Alon Plan, whereby Israel retains the Jordan Valley, where there is no
Arab population, along with the approach to it from greater Jerusalem
via Maaleh Adummim. Territorial concessions under the interim agreement
are of course derived from the Alon Plan map.
"
"Pal","Neut","The current conflict between the Palestinian people who live under
occupation and the occupying state of Israel is one that cannot be ended
with a win-lose solution. As such, many in both Palestinian and Israeli
society are convinced that this conflict cannot be brought to a close
through sheer force. Unfortunately, there is a trend in Israel that has
grown strong over the last two years, which behaves and builds its
policy on the belief that it is possible to end the conflict through
military force and then follow that victory with a solution meeting this
camp's aspirations to maintain the occupation on the one hand, and
provide security for Israel on the other. In theory, therefore, the way
out of this vicious cycle is clear, despite that we are missing the
major component of an Israeli party willing and capable of getting out
of this circle.

The belief that a war against Iraq will be a mechanical kind of
operation, starting and stopping within a currently predictable timeline
is not a clear-headed estimation. It is possible that the United States
may become preoccupied for a very long time with the consequences of the
war against Iraq, and will therefore have no time to allocate to the
Arab-Israeli conflict directly after the war. This means that the
conflict may escalate, taking the form of increasingly tragic and bloody
chapters.

On the other hand, if we assume that the international community, led by
the US, is actually willing to provide the suitable atmosphere for a
comprehensive solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, then I
believe that solution must be a complete package deal. This does not
contradict the need for gradual implementation, which will ultimately
lead to ending the occupation and enabling the Palestinian people to
practice self-determination and establish their state.

This goal should be understood from the beginning. The two peoples,
Palestinians and Israelis, are living in a state of acute frustration
regarding the possibility of finding a solution. Therefore any vision or
idea that does not give the two peoples a feeling of hope that it is
possible to achieve peace and security will not find the required
sympathy and support among the respective publics. Probably the most
important step in the first stage is to stop the deterioration in the
relationship through a plan that has a time frame of no more than three
months, during which both parties will implement their commitments fully
as follows:

* Both the Israeli and the Palestinian parties will cease all military
operations of any kind, and in any place, for two weeks.

* Israel will withdraw from the Palestinian cities in three weeks and
Palestinian Authority apparatuses will take over full responsibility for
security in these regions.

* Israel will halt its implementation of assassinations and pursuit of
wanted members of the military wings of Palestinian factions. A special
annex can be made of their names, as was done in 1994 with the names of
wanted Palestinians from the first Intifada in order to give these
elements a sense of having a national and personal stake in implementing
a state of calm.

* Palestinian security and civil institutions should be given the
opportunity to carry out their duties and achieve steps that will
strengthen the Authority's presence and implement the agreed-on reforms
(or those intended to reform Palestinian institutions, at the forefront
of which is conducting presidential, legislative and municipal elections).

* Israel will end all its measures, including imposition of the siege
and closure, and allow Palestinian citizens the freedom of movement to
go about their normal lives. Israel will stop confiscating land, and the
construction of what it calls ""the defensive wall."" Israel will release
all Palestinian funds.

With the implementation of the above steps, the situation will revert to
that existing prior to September 28, 2000, which will mark completion of
the first stage. Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
will then entrust two documents to the Quartet, in which the PLO will
pledge to reach a final and comprehensive solution in a period not
exceeding one year on the basis of United Nations Security Council
resolutions 242, 338, and United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194
pertaining to the refugee problem. Israel will pledge to reciprocate,
and will also cease all settlement activities and the confiscation of
land. The state of complete calm will continue during this period. Then
intensive negotiations will take place under the sponsorship of the
Quartet, to reach a final resolution that will lead to the following:

* Ending the occupation through a full Israeli withdrawal from all
settlement and military manifestations in the territories occupied in
1967, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with
East Jerusalem as its capital.

* Realizing security for both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.

* Solving the issue of the Palestinian refugees, justly and in
accordance with the international law resolutions.

During the negotiations, Israel will take the initiative to gradually
release the prisoners. The administrative detainees, the young and the
sick will be released first within the framework of an ongoing process.
The issue of prisoners should then be decided through the framework of a
final agreement that will lead to the release of all prisoners.

I understand fully that the ideas suggested here do not match the
current regional and international atmosphere. These concepts also
flagrantly contradict the ideology governing the behavior of the extreme
right wing in power in Israel today. However, I am confident that any
other model, one dictated by Israel's weight in the balance of power,
will not lead to a comprehensive solution for the conflict. There is a
possibility that contingency plans based on the gloomy atmosphere might
be implemented, but they will not lead to a real return to the
negotiations table, nor achieve freedom and security for Palestinians
and security and peace for the Israelis.
"
"Isr","Neut","Since the outbreak of the war in Iraq, a constant feature of the
political debate in the Middle East and beyond has been the argument
that the conflicts in Iraq and in Palestine are essentially similar,
that they are closely linked together, influence one another and are but
one struggle fought on two fronts.

The claim that Iraq and Palestine are interlinked was invoked in the
past by Iraqis seeking to capitalize on the Arab commitment to Palestine
in advancing Iraqi interests. One recalls Saddam Hussein's attempt in
1990 to mobilize Arab popular support for his plans for Kuwait, claiming
that Iraq's struggle for Kuwait was part of the Arab struggle to
liberate Palestine, and receiving an enthusiastic ovation from Yasser
Arafat. Later on Saddam bought Iraq's shares in the Palestinian struggle
by subsidizing families of suicide bombers. Nowadays Muqtada al-Sadr is
the most outspoken Iraqi figure endorsing Hamas (as well as Hizbullah).

Stories about American-Israeli cooperation in counterinsurgency,
including guided tours presumably conducted by Israeli officers for
their American opposite numbers in the Jenin refugee camp, are quoted by
proponents of the linkage argument. Analysts offer a variety of ways by
which the two conflicts influence each other or are expected to do so.

Thus it is suggested that as the insurgency in Iraq gains momentum, it
will uplift the morale of its Palestinian counterpart and instill in it
increased drive and initiative, and the revived Palestine armed struggle
will in turn bolster the resolve of the Iraqi insurgency. Moreover, the
linkage between the two conflicts is said to have already enhanced the
centrality of the Palestine problem: America's difficulties in Iraq, as
well as the growing hostility it faces from Arabs and Muslims, are bound
to force it to change its attitude and start exerting pressures on Israel.

A parallelism has even been found between the people of the besieged
Fallujah in Iraq and the Egyptian soldiers trapped in Fallujah and in
Iraq al-Manshiyyah in Palestine during the 1948 War, an experience which
provided one of them, Gamal Abd al-Nasser, with inspiration for his
pan-Arab vision. The view that the two conflicts are linked, and that
one cannot be solved without the other, is voiced by realistic and
pragmatic political figures and commentators.

Yet the two conflicts are not really interlinked. Their respective
sources and trajectories are profoundly different. In Iraq the violence
is obviously a manifestation of an inter- and intra-communal struggle
for power in preparation for the departure of the coalition forces, and
fighting against those forces is one of the cards used by competing
parties. The conflict in Iraq did not break out as a result of
developments in Palestine, and its resolution does not depend on
resolving the Palestinian problem. Similarly, were the main parties in
Iraq to agree on a formula opening the way for internal peace and
departure of coalition forces, would this change the basic positions of
Israelis and Palestinians in their conflict, or the balance of power, or
the situation on the ground?

Furthermore, the two conflicts clearly evolve independently of each
other. Jenin has indeed declared itself a twin city with Fallujah (the
one in Iraq), yet the siege of Fallujah, and the intensification of the
insurgency in Iraq in general, have not been accompanied by a similar
intensification of Palestinian operations, at least thus far. Similarly,
America's difficulties in Iraq have not forced it to change its policies
vis-a-vis Israel, again at least thus far-witness the recent Bush-Sharon
understandings.

Events in Iraq since March 2003 have only underlined what had been
obvious for some time, namely that in real political terms, pan-Arabism
exists no longer, and inter-Arab commitment is symbolic rather than
real. The struggle of the Palestinians is their own, and its fate will
be determined by whatever happens on the ground, and not far afield.

Still, Iraq does have implications for the Arab-Israel equation in a
wider sense. One is the removal of the potential eastern front threat,
following the demise of the Saddam regime. It is difficult to imagine
the reemergence of an Iraqi military threat to Israel in the next few
years. In hindsight it can be argued that the Iraqi military did not
constitute a formidable threat in the first place. Nevertheless it had
such an image, and its removal allows the introduction of changes in
Israel's strategic and political planning.

Secondly, the continued military presence of the United States in Iraq,
and its inability thus far to lead the local forces to form a
legitimate, effective and stable government, seem to erode its image as
the one power capable of setting the Middle Eastern agenda. The longer
it stays in Iraq, the harder it will be for the US to revive and lead
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. This serves the interests of
neither Palestinians nor Israelis.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What did you see in your recent trip to Iraq that evoked
for you similarities or differences with Palestine?

A: We were traveling between Baghdad and al Halla and we had to
find a bypass road to avoid an area that had been closed by the
Americans. We were stuck for more than one hour, and I thought--I even
wrote it down--that I didn't see any difference between what was
happening here and in Palestine.

This put me in the psychological situation of being at home. At times I
was frightened, not because the Americans were there, but because I was
thinking that they were Israeli soldiers--that impression was living
inside of me.

There were checkpoints and bypass roads and requests for IDs. But here
in Palestine, [the Israelis] are more hi-tech. When you get to a
checkpoint, they easily record your ID number and check the computer to
see if you are wanted. In Baghdad, the Americans don't have such things.
They are a new occupation.

Another issue that reminded me of home was the cement walls.

Q: The army is building walls?

A: The walls are closing roads, cutting off entrances to
military camps and hotels and ministries, or the way to the airport from
Baghdad. Of course, these are not dividing the country, but it does make
life difficult.

Q: From a political standpoint, what are the comparisons
that can be made?

A: I heard from Iraqi intellectuals about how the Iraqi and
Palestinian authorities are similar, in that they are called
""authorities"", but are not responsible for more than education and
health. This was a joke they told.

But in truth, the political situations are entirely different. There, we
are speaking about ""occupation""--even those in the Iraqi council call it
an occupation. But there are still some Iraqis who believe that the
American occupation is necessary in order to manage the internal divisions.

Al Iraqiya television, one of the TV stations founded by the Americans
and an official Iraqi channel, speaks of Palestine as an ""occupation"",
but when it talks about Iraq, it talks about the ""coalition forces.""
These people also do not find the two cases similar. They see the
Palestinians as having the right to rebel against the Israeli
occupation, and the Iraqi resistance as illegitimate.

Q: When you spoke with Iraqis about how they see their
future, what did they say? Do they sound like Palestinians?

A: We were there supporting the Iraqi implementation of a large
survey about living conditions. We traveled all over Kirkuk, Halqut and
Yacouba. The Iraqis say they are unsure about their future. At the
beginning of the war, they had a lot of hope, but now they are not sure
how things will be.

My Iraqi friends said that those of us living in Palestine and Iraq are
going to compete with each other for quite a long time over whose
situation is worse. But even as they make this comparison, most of them
believe that the Iraqi problem will be solved more easily than the
Palestinian problem.

Q: In your experience, how do Palestinians view Iraq?

A: A lot of Palestinians make the comparison in the sense that
when they watch television, it is hard for them to distinguish
[visually] between Iraq and Palestine. But the context is very
different. Here in Palestine, we are speaking about daily conflict, not
only with Israeli soldiers, but with the Israeli people in the form of
settlers, the bypass roads, the fence.

I believe that the Iraqi problem is easily solved, when compared with
Palestine. Here, on the other hand, we are speaking about another people
that want to replace us, not only occupy us. They want our land. There,
it is more economic and another kind of political agenda, for which
there might be an agreement that you can be happy with. But for
Palestinians, any new agreement is difficult--even [Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel] Sharon's proposal was rejected by the Likud. Our issue
is much more complicated.
"
"Isr","Neut","In the summer of 2000, barely a month before the Camp David summit, a
group of Israelis and Palestinians convened in Europe to discuss the
issues of the Holy Sites in Jerusalem. A number of religious leaders
also took part. At one point in the discussion, an Islamic cleric let
loose with a verbal volley, rife with anti-Semitic imagery, the gist of
which was: ""You Jews should look for your Temple elsewhere. You have no
ties to Harem a-Sharif.""

An embarrassed hush fell over the deliberations. When we broke, one of
the senior Palestinians came over and said apologetically: ""Do you see
the kind of prejudices Chairman Arafat has to deal with in his
constituency?""

Two weeks after the Camp David summit, I received a phone call from a
senior American negotiator. ""I just came from Arafat,"" he said. ""He
really doesn't think the Temple is there. How do we explain it too him?""
It turned out that the barriers to a resolution of the issue of the
Temple Mount/Harem a-Sharif were not only in ""the constituencies"" but in
the hearts and minds of the senior decisionmakers. It also became
apparent that the negotiators were singularly unprepared to deal with
the volatile and complex issues at hand.

Any attempt to move forward towards a political resolution of the issue
of the Mount/Harem requires an analysis of the underlying factors that
led to failure in the political talks. I wish to offer a number of
tentative observations in this regard:

* The Mount/Harem is no mere ""real estate"": the site and the symbolism
it evokes are the primordial materials of which national consciousness
is made. Two mutually incompatible national narratives compete in the
same limited sacred space, in the place most important to each party.

* In the past, those engaged in the preparatory negotiations concerning
the Mount/Harem, were least prone to hear the symbolic ""siren call"" of
the Mount/Harem--and on both sides, those most attuned to its powerful
imagery were least prone to dialogue.

* In the years prior to Camp David, Jewish claims to the Mount were
subsumed in the monolithic claims enunciated by Israel in regard to ""a
united Jerusalem,"" further contributing to the Palestinian failure to
fathom the depth and intensity of the Jewish sentiments.

* The ""creative ideas"" for the Mount/Harem often proved to be ""gimmicks""
that did not disclose a grasp of how the symbolic imagery resonates in
each constituency. The Clinton proposals, which envisage a ""vertical""
differentiation of sovereignty on the Mount/Harem, proved
counterproductive, exacerbating rather than allaying irrational fears.
An extensive Palestinian popular literature exists, promulgating the
baseless fear that the Zionists would emerge from underground shafts and
engulf the Mosques. The Clinton proposals inadvertently fell on these
irrational fears. Prime Minister Barak's position that he would not
""turn over"" sovereignty on the Mount to Palestinians (implying he could
turn it over to a third party, who in turn would deliver sovereignty to
the Palestinians, as though it were an ""assist"" in basketball) had
little potential popular credibility.

* Israeli public opinion perceives the denial of legitimate Jewish
claims to the Mount as a litmus test, indicating that the Palestinians
have not acquiesced to the legitimacy of Israeli presence anywhere in
the Land of Israel.

* The Mount/Harem is the quintessential arena in which the extreme
elements on both sides attempt to undermine a comprehensive political
agreement between the parties. A sustained assault, rhetorical and
otherwise, by these extremes, is a given, and requires clear and
aggressive crisis-management mechanisms in any future political settlement.

* There are established Jewish and Islamic religious traditions that are
conducive to compromise. Strong religious/cultural Jewish schools of
thought place little stock in physical control of the Mount--provided
that the legitimacy of the Jewish narrative and claim is recognized, and
that the sanctity of Jewish artifacts is protected from desecration.
There is a respected Islamic tradition which recognizes the legitimacy
of historic Jewish ties to the Harem, in ways that do not derogate from
the depth of the claims of Islam.

* It is regrettable that the arrangements on the Mount/Harem have
""congealed"" around the issue of sovereignty, a term singularly
inappropriate to resolving the ""clash of narratives."" However, after the
Clinton parameters, it is highly unlikely that a settlement of the
Mount/Harem will take place without some form of Palestinian sovereignty
over the Mount/Harem. The stronger the affirmations of the legitimacy of
Jewish ties to the Mount, and the mechanisms for protection of Jewish
interests--the stronger the Israeli public willingness will be to cede
sovereignty on the Mount to the Palestinians.

* The issues involved cannot be solved by either gimmick or obfuscation.
At the end of the day, a political settlement will require the courage
of two national political leaders attuned to their own national and
religious traditions. They need to hammer out of these malleable
materials arrangements that will allow each party to maintain its ties
to a site sacred to both, in a manner not threatening to the beliefs and
interests of the other. The materials exist--and await the political
courage necessary to put them in place.
"
"Pal","Neut","In the Name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate

The places of worship of all religions have never enjoyed respect and
appreciation as they have under the Islamic faith. God says: ""For had it
not been for Allah's repelling some men by means of others, cloisters
and churches and oratories and mosques, wherein the name of Allah is oft
mentioned, would assuredly have been pulled down. Verily Allah helpeth
one who helpeth Him. Lo! Allah is Strong, Almighty.""-Al Haj, Sura 40.

When Abu Bakr Al Siddeeq sent out troops, one of his most important
missives was: ""Don't demolish a place of worship; don't kill an old man,
or a woman or a baby and don't uproot any tree.""

As such, history has not recorded any act of aggression on Christian or
Jewish places of worship because Islam granted freedom of belief and
worship for all those in Islamic society following other religions.

To offer evidence that the Al Aqsa Mosque is an authentic and sole right
of Muslims, we say that first, historical sources demonstrate that the
blessed Al Aqsa Mosque was built in the period that the Ka'ba in Mecca
was built, with a time difference of 40 years. Imam Bukhari quoted Abi
Thar Al Ghafari saying: ""I asked the Prophet which mosque was built
first? He said, the Holy Mosque. I said, which one? He said the Aqsa
Mosque. I said, how many years between them? He said 40 years. And
whichever mosque you reach, just pray in it.""

This confirms that the Aqsa Mosque was built before the presence of any
mosque, church, or temple, and before any of the tribes of the sons of
Israel. This refutes the Jewish claim that the Aqsa Mosque was built on
the ruins of the supposed Temple.

Second, nothing in the truthful word of Islam mentions that Solomon
built the Aqsa Mosque or any construct on the site of the Aqsa Mosque.
The Samaritans, who are one sect of Judaism, believe that the Temple was
built on the ruins of Mount Jerazim in Nablus.

In addition, the only knowledge of the Temple is in the scriptures of
the sons of Israel. These scriptures rely on images and recollections
that do not stand up in the face of documented historical scientific
evidence.

Third, God says, ""Glorified be He Who carried His servant by night from
the Inviolable Place of Worship to the Far Distant Place of Worship the
neighborhood whereof We have blessed, that We might show him of Our
tokens! Lo! He, only He is the Hearer, the Seer.""

Among the matters that are agreed upon is the fact that the Aqsa Mosque
is located in the city of Jerusalem in Palestine. Prophet Moses told his
people: ""My people, enter the Holy Lands."" This is proof that Jerusalem
and Palestine were sacred even before the people of Moses. The presence
of the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and Palestine was before the coming of
the sons of Israel in Palestine and before the prophets of the sons of
Israel from whom Jews claim their inheritance.

Fourth, the prophetic texts affirm the benefits of the Aqsa Mosque and
the Holy Land. Imam Ahmad quoted Thi Al Asabe' saying: ""Our Prophet, if
we are doomed to live after you, where do you order us to stay? He said:
You stay in the Holy Land, may you have your offspring there and go to
the mosque.""

Prophet Mohammed said, ""Those who can make a pilgrimage from the Aqsa
Mosque to the Holy Mosque, they will be granted heaven.""

Fifth, the Aqsa Mosque was the first Qibla of Muslims. Prophet Mohammed
and his followers prayed for 16 months towards the city of Jerusalem,
until the Qibla was changed towards the Ka'ba. The Hanif faith
demonstrated the benefits of praying in the Aqsa Mosque when the Prophet
said, ""Praying in the Holy Mosque is worth 1,000 prayers, and prayer in
my mosque is worth 1,000 prayers and praying in the Holy Land is worth
500 prayers.""

Sixth, the ideological status of the Aqsa Mosque in the hearts of
Muslims flows from the faith of the masses since the Omari Invasion.
This has been evident through the great interest expressed by national
scholars in building and establishing sites inside the Aqsa Mosque and
on its outskirts. The religious schools growing around the Asqa Mosque
are the strongest evidence for the status of the Aqsa Mosque in the
hearts of Muslims.

Israeli aggression against holy sites, in particular the Aqsa Mosque, is
proof that there is a lack of Jewish respect for other religions and
that the various sects of Jews do not agree over the status of the Aqsa
Mosque.

For Muslims, Jerusalem and the Aqsa Mosque is not a claim, but a right
granted by God in the Holy Qur'an and the other religious books. Adam
built the Aqsa Mosque as a unifier of people. The occurrences of the
Isra' and Mi'raj are evidence enough of Al Aqsa's great status in the
hearts of Muslims.
"
"Isr","Neut","An Israeli air strike on an alleged Islamic Jihad site near Damascus was
launched on October 5, 2003 in retaliation for the devastating suicide
bombing in Haifa by a female member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
This airstrike, the first inside Syria since the Yom Kippur War of
October 1973, apart from aiming at satisfying the desire for revenge
among Israelis, also carried a stern threat to Bashar of Damascus: stop
hosting these militant Palestinian groups--or you will be held
responsible and pay a high price!

If this is indeed Israel's new strategy, it may prove to be futile and
will possibly backfire if Hizballah or even Syria itself launches
missiles into Israel. But even if Damascus shuts down the bases of these
militant organizations--Hamas and Islamic Jihad--their violent
anti-Israel activities in the occupied territories and in Israel would
hardly be reduced; nor would the Israeli-Palestinian impasse be
resolved. Indeed, Damascus is likely to continue to do its utmost to
enhance this conflict as long as it serves its strategic interests.

Syria has a long record of using various Palestinian organizations in
the conflict with Israel, while also endeavoring to block or undermine
Palestinian attempts at rapprochement with Israel. Thus, before 1967,
the Ba'th regime in Damascus backed the Fatah organization and
permitted, even encouraged it to carry out subversive activities inside
Israel, including an attempt to sabotage the Jordan-Negev water project.
And after 1967, Syria periodically employed various Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) groups--partly from within its own borders, and
mostly via Lebanon--to attack civilian and military targets in Israel
and the occupied territories.

Ba'thist Syria and the PLO held similar ideological and strategic
concepts regarding the struggle against Israel, and for years Damascus
rendered military, logistic, and diplomatic support to the PLO. All
this--provided the PLO followed or adjusted to Syrian dictates. But
whenever the PLO's decisions and actions clashed with Syrian interests
or priorities, Damascus would take strong measures, including military
actions against the PLO. This was particularly the case in 1976 during
the Lebanese Civil War, when Syrian troops fought against disobedient
Palestinian fighters and subsequently did not prevent the Tal Za'atar
massacre of Palestinians by Maronites. And during the 1982 Israeli
invasion of Lebanon the Syrian army refrained from defending the
Palestinian infrastructure in southern Lebanon against the Israeli assault.

Significantly, following the Palestinian National Council recognition in
1988 of United Nations Resolutions 242
                                            and 181
                                            (the partition resolution of
1947), and in view of the PLO inclination to negotiate with Israel for
the first time, President Hafez al Asad vehemently attacked Palestinian
leader Yasir Arafat. Asad told Arafat that Palestinian independent
decision-making should terminate whenever it was incompatible with
Syrian national interests. Asad continued to harshly criticize Arafat
for not coordinating his moves with Damascus during the Madrid Peace
Conference of 1991 and particularly before signing the Oslo peace
accords                                             in 1993 with Israel.
Hinting that Arafat may pay with his own life for his misbehavior, Asad
continued to oppose the Oslo peace process while hosting the Hamas and
Islamic Jihad terrorist organizations, even during the Syrian-Israeli
Madrid peace process.

Following the collapse of that process in March 2000 and Asad's death
three months later in June, President Bashar al Asad has continued to
back the militant Palestinian organizations and has also supported the
al-Aqsa intifada that began in September of that same year. He alleged
that the solution of the Palestinian problem is more important than
settling the issue of the Golan Heights, and insisted that the
Palestinian ""right-of-return"" must be implemented, namely the return of
Palestinian refugees into Israel proper. On several occasions, including
a meeting with the Pope in Syria in May 2001, Bashar fiercely attacked
Israel and equated it to Nazi Germany.

To be sure, with such anti-Israel rhetoric and extreme positions on the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Bashar has contributed to inflaming this
as well as Syria's own conflict with Israel. Even though Bashar has
repeatedly said that peace with Israel continues to be Syria's
""strategic choice,"" his actual positions have alienated more and more
Israelis, as well as many Americans. Thus, not only are most Israelis
opposed to returning the Golan Heights to Syria, even for a peace
agreement, but Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government may interpret
the Syria Accountability Act (SAA), approved by the US Congress on
October 15, 2003, as a yellow if not a green light to continue attacking
Palestinian terrorist sites inside Syria (the SAA threatens to impose
economic and diplomatic sanctions against Syria if Damascus continues to
harbor terrorist organizations, to develop weapons of mass destruction,
and to occupy Lebanon). Such attacks are likely to further imperil
relations between Israel and Syria and between Israel and the
Palestinians.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: How do you explain the recent Israeli missile attack
near Damascus?

A: It was a theatrical show and a message sent to Syria. Syria is
probably incapable currently of being dragged into such a battle easily
and therefore, it did not offer a direct response. Syria is not
interested in being dragged kicking, at such unsuitable timing, into a
battle. We consider the Israeli action an isolated event to check the
response and deliver a message--not more than this.

Q: Do you expect more Israeli operations in the future?

A: The Syrians articulated their position clearly. They said that
the offices of the Islamic Jihad are political, not used for military
training. Their position on this is a fair one, and it is impossible
that they would close these offices used for conveying the political
views of their brothers in Palestine.

Syria will not change its position, however it will also not contribute
to escalation in the current circumstances. Syria is undergoing a
process of development and [its leadership] is aware of the conditions
in Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine. They are alert and not interested in
escalation.

Q: Israel is claiming that Syria supports Palestinian
resistance?

A: This is an old Syrian position. Even though it has not
contributed to deterioration along the borders since the Oslo Accords
                                           , it has never stopped
supporting the [Palestinian] resistance movements. However, those
movements do not use Syrian land as the base for their military
operations since Syria has international commitments that it cannot
avoid. All these accusations [by Israel] are political.

There are connections to be made between what is happening in Syria and
Iraq, after demands were made that Syria deter infiltrators [along the
Syria-Iraq border]. But Syria would have to deploy double the number of
troops to respond to this demand. We see what is happening in
Afghanistan where hundreds of thousands of soldiers are deployed. This
is a public relations attack against Syria and the truth is that it is
unjust.

Q: How do you explain Syria's agreement to the Beirut
declaration at the Arab summit where it proposed peace with Israel in
exchange for a full withdrawal from the occupied territories and a
settlement for the refugees?

A: Syria advocates peace and has articulated this on several
occasions. There were negotiations over peace with Israel that were
stopped during [Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak] Rabin's time and the
Syrians still claim that they are ready to resume the talks from the
point at which they were stopped. This indicates a wish for peace--but a
just one. Syria recognized United Nations Resolution 242
                                           , and then attended the
Madrid conference in order to end the Arab-Israel conflict. Syria is
still ready, but Israel has not matured. As long as Syria is distant
from the negotiations process, there will be no peace, or it will be
defective.

Q: Do you think Syria is in a dangerous position after the
Israeli and American threats?

A: I believe that the United States is prepared to repeat its
conduct in Iraq in every Arab country. Some conditions that existed in
Iraq are not present in Syria. Syria has a national front, and the
social and economic situation is stable. They will not find any weapons
of mass destruction in Syria because it is busy with its development
project and is trying to preserve its political position in the face of
all resistance.

There is a broad front supporting Syria and it has backing from all of
the Arab states. There is no justification at all for an attack on
Syria, unlike Iraq. Neither the international context nor the regional
one would allow the outbreak of war and all its destructive
implications. Therefore, I do not think that Syria is in great danger.
It has not committed a provocation to initiate a war.
"
"Isr","Neut","The Oslo Declaration of Principles (DOP) was signed more than eight
years ago. About three years ago a bilateral Israeli-Palestinian
permanent agreement was supposed to take effect. We are as far away from
such an agreement today as we were nearly six years ago, in
February-March 1996, when the process came to a halt following a wave of
terrorist attacks. All attempts made since then to get negotiations back
on track and renew the Oslo process have collapsed. Six years appear to
constitute a sufficient period of time to recognize that we have failed
and to search for alternative approaches.

The first suitable step is soul searching: what was accomplished and
what was not accomplished through the Oslo process?

On the positive side, the Oslo DOP was revolutionary. After more than 70
years of zero sum confrontation between the two sides, the two national
movements, Zionist and Palestinian, recognized and accepted one
another's right to exist as an independent national unit. The
Palestinian national leadership established itself among its people,
within the borders of the future Palestinian state. From Israel's
standpoint, the government ceased bearing political and administrative
responsibility for the fate of three million Palestinian residents of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, thus bringing to an end 30 years of
imposed military rule.

On the negative side, the drafters of the agreement made one huge
mistake; they tried to put the cart before the horse. The DOP ushered in
a process of territorial transfers that pinned hopes on confidence
building measures by both sides; these in turn were intended to prepare
public opinion prior to initiating final status negotiations. Herein
lies the catch: it quickly (and predictably) became evident that a
reverse process had commenced. Both sides began feverishly creating new
and negative facts on the ground that would enable them to improve
positions in anticipation of the final dispensation of each final status
issue.

The Al-Aqsa Intifada began 14 months ago. Throughout this time we have
witnessed repeated mediation attempts intended to bring about a
ceasefire and to facilitate renewal of negotiations. By any standard, 14
months are enough time to conclude that there is no chance for such an
initiative to succeed. On the contrary, the violent, persistent and
painful struggle has gradually hardened public opinion, to the point
where both sides are less and less ready to end the violence without
knowing in advance what the political payoff is.

Historical experience teaches us that in nearly all armed conflicts it
is not the ceasefire that precedes negotiations but, to the contrary, it
is political negotiations and the agreement they produce that facilitate
and generate a ceasefire. Indeed, both sides in such a violent conflict
take into account that negotiations and a political agreement will
clearly express the balance of forces in their armed conflict.

Isn't it time we learned from the experience of others? Does it still
make sense to adhere stubbornly to a failed process and repeatedly renew
a sterile effort focused entirely on achieving a ceasefire prior to
negotiating? It would be better for all three parties--Israel, the
Palestinians and the US--to abandon the Tenet and Mitchell plans once
and for all, and to open negotiations even as the violence and armed
struggle continue on both sides. Renewing negotiations under these
conditions will create a new situation: at a stroke the ground will be
pulled out from under those terrorists who enjoy the capacity to torpedo
negotiations at any moment by carrying out acts that destroy the ""quiet""
demanded as a precondition for negotiating.

Such an approach is based not only on practical logic. It also
constitutes pressure on both parties to accelerate the negotiating
process, in the clear knowledge that if they don't reach agreement and
understanding, then the current impasse will necessarily be solved by
decisive military action between them.
"
"Pal","Neut","There is no doubt that what Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon fears
most right now is for the American peace mission led by General Anthony
Zinni to push for serious political negotiations based on lifting the
siege on Palestinians, an end to Israeli aggression against the
Palestinian people, a total halt to settlement activities and an
international force providing protection to the Palestinian people.

As such, Sharon is relying on the Palestinian Authority's inability to
meet his unending and multiplying security conditions. Sharon will use
all his might to maintain the state of military confrontation because
this maintains his image as the anti-terrorism ""warrior"" (the title he
chose for his biography). A shift to political issues will expose the
charlatan peacemaker Sharon as what he really is - an avid opponent of
the peace process. Only this will produce the breakthrough necessary to
create new political trends inside Israeli society that are separate
from the right-wing fascist and racist trends seen today.

Now that the United States administration has commenced a diplomatic
initiative and followed it up with Zinni's visit, this breakthrough is
in American hands. Zinni's visit could be one means of exposing the
positions of both parties, demonstrating who truly desires peace. But to
do this, Zinni's mediation in practice must be based on the specific
principles outlined in Powell's speech - opposing illegal occupation,
settlement expansion, restrictions on movement, as well as violence and
terror.

Further, Zinni could help frustrate Sharon's plans by supporting the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in dispelling the false and
prominent impression among Palestinians that a ceasefire is the same as
acquiescing to occupation. The PNA must refute the idea that Palestinian
internal politics is at its breaking point, as well as address the
national movements that resort to gunfire only to mask their inability
to lead the public in marches against occupation. (It is important to
note that the absence of widespread participation in the Intifada gives
Israel the wrong impression that the Palestinian people are worn out and
exhausted and cannot continue to resist occupation much longer. Indeed,
the Palestinian will remains unbowed.)

After September 11, the new international climate provides both
opportunities and dead ends. For Palestinians, it has now become
impossible to rely on the Arab states or international intervention,
since all are pressing for negotiations at all cost. This has been
demonstrated through US and European pressure, starting with US demands
of the Arab countries following Powell's speech. It has also been
reflected in letters sent by President George W. Bush to several Arab
leaders, calling on them to exert pressure on the Palestinian leadership
to ""get serious"" about restoring calm and ending violence.

These American demands are not new, however they gain power and
influence following Secretary of State Colin Powell's speech - and
herein lies the real danger. The American administration must realize
that is does not aid its cause in using the Arab countries to pressure
Palestinians. Doing so only solidifies Palestinian desperation. The Arab
states, too, must shoulder their role as a source of support for the
Palestinian cause and a just solution according to international law.
This should be translated into a unified Arab stance and an action plan
that responds to American attempts at division.

While some Palestinians expressed the sense that Powell's speech
contained new, hopeful elements, more must soon be on the way. The visit
and mission of Zinni is a test for whether the principles offered in
Powell's speech were serious or only pretty packaging.

Indeed, US integrity in mediation is at stake. Palestinians will measure
the seriousness of the United States position in talks with the US
administration over the nature of its mediation; its understanding of
United Nations Resolutions 242 and 338 and the mechanics of the US role
in the negotiating process.

Only after these discussions will we be able to monitor how the United
States moves forward regarding United Nations Security Council
resolutions, the negotiations process and pressure applied to Israel to
respect international law. The way in which Zinni fulfills all of these
will be the true test of American intentions.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: What is your position on unilateral redeployment?

A: I'm very strongly in favor of building an effective fence and
other barriers along the Green Line, mainly in the central part of
Israel, say from Mei Ami to Latrun. This would be a technical defensive
measure to make the movement of terrorists into Israel more difficult.
It would be a partial but necessary measure.

Q: Can this be effective if the Israel Defense Forces are
busy defending the settlements beyond that fence?

A: As deputy minister of defense I headed a project in the year 2000
to prepare a unilateral separation plan for Prime Minister Barak in case
the Camp David talks failed. This did not include dismantling
settlements, but it examined the practical implications, so I'm very
familiar with the facts. I drew the map. I can speak about it
authoritatively.

Q: Could you relate, then, to a plan that involves
withdrawing to the settlement blocs near the Green Line and dismantling
the settlements in Gaza and the West Bank heartland, while remaining in
the Jordan Valley and Greater Jerusalem?

A: The plan means the de facto annexation of 30 percent of the West
Bank, half in the Jordan Valley, which you have to keep if there is no
agreement, and half in the settlement blocs. Once you put an effective
fence on the eastern side of the settlement blocs, this is de facto
annexation. If makes you the total sovereign in the settlement bloc
areas. It includes around 70,000-100,000 Palestinians who reside in
these areas.

All the experts on international law told us that this would bring about
a terrible response. The international community, let alone the Arab
world, would accuse us of annexation. Terrorism wouldn't stop; it would
use the de facto annexation as a pretext to continue. Indeed, terrorism
would increase to show that it doesn't work for us to take Arab
territory and Arab population by force. Terrorism would gain more
legitimacy from the international community. The fence would prevent
penetration into the settlement blocs but wouldn't stop the annexed
Palestinians from fighting from inside. Nor would the fence stop rockets
and mortars, for example, fired from Salfit toward Ariel. So even
settlements included inside the fence would be easy targets.

Q: How would unilateral redeployment affect Israeli deterrence?

A: The withdrawal would send a very bad message regarding deterrence.
The Palestinians would have no incentive to negotiate and every
incentive to keep fighting.

Q: Even a negotiated and agreed plan for Israel to keep the
settlement blocs, such as was discussed at Camp David and Taba, would
leave some Palestinians inside Israel.

A: The agreed maps I know would reduce this number to a few thousand.
But under unilateral withdrawal, what do you do with them? You can't
annex them, you don't want to make them citizens, and you don't want to
impose a new military government.

Q: Won't your plan of building a fence directly along the
Green Line be seen as a de-facto border also?

A: No. I would not redeploy the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. It would
remain in the West Bank and Gaza to secure the settlements. Having said
that, I have no problem declaring that long segments of the future
Israeli-Palestinian border will be identical with the Green Line that
I'm fortifying, for example between Kfar Saba and Qalqilya, where in any
case we have no room to maneuver.

Q: If you leave 50,000 settlers and the army beyond the fence
this isn't separation at all.

A: I don't believe there is an Israeli government that has the
political power to dismantle settlements against the settlers' will and
without an agreement.

Q: Do you believe that an Israeli government could dismantle
these settlements if it did have an agreement?

A: Yes. The public is ready to pay the price if the reward is peace,
but not if the conflict continues under different conditions.

Q: Opinion polls show that around 50 percent of Israelis
already favor unilaterally dismantling settlements. Why shouldn't the
Labor Party consider this as its policy?

A: A serious party cannot take something non-implementable and make
it a slogan. This idea has become popular due to public despair. When
you give the public the details, it reconsiders its support. Look, I'm a
medical doctor. This is like a patient with terminal cancer suggesting
that he drink hydrochloric acid to burn out the cancer. This is not a
solution. I don't agree that there's no hope. Things are not static.
That's why I favor [Knesset Chairman Avraham] Burg's going to Ramallah
[to address the Palestinian National Assembly].
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: How would you describe the changes happening right now in
Jerusalem and plans for more ""separation"" in the future? [Ed.'s note:
Israeli officials approved this week a plan to tighten security and
checkpoints along a ""seam"" between the West Bank and Jerusalem. Plans
for a wall were not approved.]

A: These measures, simply, are the tightening of the isolation
of Jerusalem from the rest of the Palestinian occupied territories. What
is new in this case is that [Israeli authorities] are isolating, not
only Jerusalem within the municipal borders, but also the Arab
neighborhoods around the city. We are worried that these measures that
they are taking now--they claim that they are being taken for security
reasons--will be exploited for political purposes. There are areas that
are Area B, over which the Palestinian Authority has full civilian
control, that are being annexed within this belt. In the future, we are
worried that Israel will try to change the status of these areas.

Q: How does this ""separation"" affect Palestinians on the ground?

A: The life of East Jerusalem depends on the areas and villages
around it. People go to Jerusalem to buy and sell, to see a doctor--and
for all kinds of services. Even before the recent measures, these Arabs
were not allowed to go to Jerusalem, so this affected both sides. It
affected the life inside Jerusalem, mainly economic, in that Jerusalem
residents were suffocating under this pressure. And it affected these
people outside because they could not get to Jerusalem. The effect is
not only economic, but cultural, as well. People cannot go to schools or
to social events or the schools and universities. People cannot get to
the church and to the mosque.

There is another dimension that people rarely speak about and that is
terror. I mean that when Palestinians are not allowed to go to
Jerusalem, but they must go for the reasons I listed above, they are
always afraid that the police will see them and arrest them. Anyone who
penetrates Jerusalem through the bypass roads or dirt roads is always
afraid that the police will stop him in the street, ask him for his ID
and, when they discover that he is Palestinian, arrest him.

In my opinion, this is not worse than an Israeli walking in the street
in fear that a bomb will explode. In the end, when you don't feel
secure, you are terrorized. This terror is made by a state, by Israel,
and therefore it is easy to ask that state to stop this terror and allow
people to live normally.

Q: But Israelis say that this is necessary to maintain their
security.

A: It has been proven very clearly that these measures cannot
protect Israelis. Attacks take place in spite of all the closures and
the checkpoints. It is time for Israelis to understand that their peace
and security will only be achieved by making peace with Palestinians.
That peace cannot be achieved without negotiating an agreement, so that
each side has the chance to live in peace and dignity in their own state.

Q: How does what you see around you reflect the Israeli
negotiation plan?

A: I am not sure. [Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud] Barak
proposed that all of the settlements around Jerusalem be annexed to
Jerusalem and that the Arab neighborhoods would be under Palestinian
sovereignty. Now the villages are inside this belt, so there is a
withdrawal from what was suggested and an attempt to create de facto a
totally different situation.

In discussing these things, it is always important to define the borders
of Jerusalem and whether we are talking about the city within its
municipal borders or Greater Jerusalem [i.e., Israeli annexation and
expansion of the Jerusalem boundaries since the occupation of the West
Bank]. Israel is further attempting to affect the political balance of
the city by expelling as many Palestinians as possible from Jerusalem
under the cover of [rescinding] blue identity cards, which is actually a
permanent residence card.

Q: How would you respond to Israeli attempts to further
create unilateral separation--with a wall around the West Bank and
perhaps even the evacuation of some settlements? Could this be at all
positive for Palestinians?

A: The Israelis did not discuss this plan with us, what we have
is what is in the media. In principle, any unilateral act is not
acceptable to us. We are totally against it because we believe that this
is an attempt to create facts on the ground.

We have no choice but to stick to the land. We hope that meanwhile there
will be a return to political negotiations. The Palestinian Authority is
in contact with our friends in the United States and Europe to urge them
to practice pressure to stop this harassment and stop the changing of
facts on the ground in general and in Jerusalem, specifically.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: How do you see Crown Prince Abdullah's initiative?

A: It is very interesting. I haven't heard it laid out openly by
the Crown Prince, but if what is written in Tom Friedman's article
becomes an official Saudi proposal, this is a positive development, in
that it embodies recognition of the State of Israel and acceptance of
normalization between Israel and the Arabs. I attach particular
importance to the initiative because Saudi Arabia is the defender of the
Muslim holy sites, and the conflict has been tainted recently by
religious aspects, with Islam abused by some people to justify murders
and other criminal acts.

Q: Abdullah's premise is that Israel will withdraw to the
1967 borders.

A: Israeli-Arab borders have to be determined by negotiation, not
by preconditions. Israel does not share the concept of borders embodied
in the Saudi proposal. Henry Siegman of the New York Council on Foreign
Relations has pointed out that the Saudis don't mean the exact 1967
lines, even in Jerusalem. So if borders can be negotiated, we end up
with an Israeli state alongside a Palestinian state, and Saudi Arabia
rallies the Arab League, this is an interesting development.

Q: Can the Saudis get the entire Arab League to support this
idea?

A: I find it difficult to see an Arab League consensus on this,
with the Iraqis, the Libyans and others.

Q: What's missing from the initiative?

A: The proposal--if, I emphasize, it is a proposal, because we
haven't yet heard it directly--doesn't mention many things, most
prominently the Temple Mount issue in Jerusalem and the refugee/right of
return issue, that have to be negotiated. In connection with the
refugees, Israel's view of a successful two-state solution includes a
statement regarding the end of conflict. So if this is indeed a serious
proposal it must stipulate that this is the end of the conflict. This is
the litmus test. Then the proposal can afford not to mention certain
final status issues.

Q: What's the next step?

A: This shouldn't be left as just an interview or an idea hovering
over the Middle East or Washington. The next step could be mutual visits
or Saudi-Israeli negotiations or Arab League negotiations with Israel.
If, on the other hand, this initiative remains in the PR phase, the
impression will be that it was meant to improve the Saudi image in the US.

Q: The Saudis' reply is apparently that Israel should first
make peace, then they will talk about normalization.

A: If Saudi Arabia wants to play a role in peacemaking, then we
need to talk.

Q: Can Prime Minister Ariel Sharon accept the Saudi
territorial demands, even with minor adjustments?

A: The premise of the peace process, including the Oslo accords,
is a territorial settlement based on [United Nations Security Council]
Resolution 242. I don't believe a new basis is needed. We know there is
a border controversy. Sharon is the first Israeli prime minister to
agree up front to a Palestinian state. At Camp David in July 2000, where
I participated in the negotiations, the border issue was not the reason
for failure. It was clear that there would be no complete return to the
1967 border, the armistice lines, and that the main settlement blocs
would be incorporated into Israel. If Saudi Arabia wants the 1967 lines,
this goes beyond Camp David, which failed over the refugee and Temple
Mount issues. So we need to see a concrete proposal.

Q: One of the reasons given for the failure of Camp David was
the Saudi refusal to support compromises by Yasir Arafat. Have the
Saudis now reversed course?

A: The notion that the Arab world was not prepared to support
Arafat at Camp David is unfounded criticism. Had Arafat accepted an
agreement at Camp David, he would have had the Arabs behind him. It is
patronizing, childish and naive to think that Arafat needs this
legitimacy. He has to make the courageous historical compromise
decision, then most of the other Arabs will support him. Menachem Begin
didn't wait for the Arab world when he made peace with Egypt, nor did
Rabin with Jordan or when he signed Oslo. The idea that Arafat needs a
cradle or else he cannot sign is patronizing. ""Peace of the brave"" means
that Arafat has to be brave.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What is your first general impression of the Saudi
initiative?

A: I think it is the most significant thing to come from the Arab
world since the convening of the Madrid peace conference in 1991. I
believe this is a very courageous step by Saudi Arabia. I really hope
that the United States will not try to undermine these efforts and will
concentrate on the strategic importance of this initiative. I hope that
the United States will understand that what it will take to bring us and
the Israelis outside of this current deteriorating situation is not
going to be this security arrangement program or that security
arrangement program but part of a package that can provide for a
political hope and political horizon and political solution.

I hope that this Saudi message will reach the Israeli people to show
them that there is an alternative and that the alternative is peace and
the shortest way to peace is ending the Israeli occupation.

Q: What do you see as the major pitfalls lying in the path of
this plan?

A: I hope that, first of all, the Arab countries in the next Arab
summit in Beirut at the end of the month will introduce a resolution to
adopt [Saudi] Prince Abdullah's ideas. I hope that this will be followed
up by real, hard work to establish a partnership with the Europeans and
the Russians and the Non-Aligned Movement and I hope that after that a
dialogue will begun between the Arabs and the United States in order to
maximize this effort.

Q: The question that a lot of Palestinians seem to be asking
is, what about the refugees?

A: Well, I don't think that you can say that the Saudi ideas or
initiative undermines the refugees in any way. I think that the Saudi
[ideas] are based on the relevant [United Nations] Security Council
resolutions and that this [initiative] is consistent because the refugee
problem is going to be solved in accordance with Resolution 194.

That is what I meant [when I asked] for the Americans not to undermine
these events by discussing the details. The details are a matter of
negotiations and not for the Saudis.

Q: If that is the case, then aren't we back to square one?
The details are what Palestinians and Israelis are having trouble with,
aren't they?

A: No, I don't think that we have trouble with the details. I think
we came a long way in the previous negotiations and the Israelis must
make up their minds. If the Israelis want real full peace with
normalization, that requires real full withdrawal to the June 4, 1967
borders and a just solution to the refugees based on Resolution 194.

Q: Is it possible that the rest of the Arab world might make
peace and leave the Palestinians behind?

A: That is impossible.
"
"Isr","Neut","Although it served in wartime, the Likud-Labor government was not really
a ""government of national unity."" During its tenure, terrorists murdered
more than 650 Israelis (the equivalent of some 30,000 out of the 250
million Arabs in the Middle East, when measured in proportion to the
size of the population), but the Labor ministers, and certainly their
members of Knesset, frequently behaved like hostile members of the
opposition--as if these were normal times.

Now that the government has fallen due to what most of the public
considers to be ""primaries tactics,"" not a few right wingers are happy.
The settlers especially were glad ""to finally be rid of those left
wingers."" That is an emotional reaction, certainly justified in terms of
the left's behavior toward them, including dismantling the outposts for
obviously political motives. But paradoxically the true interests of the
right, including the settlers, are liable to suffer in the absence of a
government that comprises representatives of the left.

Example: Despite United States President Bush's speech of June 24, the
""road map"" presented on behalf of the US administration by Assistant
Secretary of State William Burns demands that Israel pay the main price
for the terrorist war initiated by Yasir Arafat two years ago. And the
Arabs, at least in the first phase, are not even required to end all
terrorist attacks. All they are asked to do is declare that they ""oppose
violence."" This provision, like the establishment of a Palestinian state
along the 1967 borders or the abandoning of the US demand to collect
illegal weapons--a provision the Americans insisted on in the past--are
unacceptable to the responsible Israeli left as well. But when that left
is in the opposition, the political dynamic is liable to cause them to
avoid standing by the government to rebuff American pressures even
regarding demands that they oppose. In terms of the role of American
Jewry as well, the administration can apply greater pressure than
against a government in which the left is represented.

This holds for the settlements, too: the government that fell maintained
the status quo, i.e., no new settlements. But there was also no
hindrance to the natural development of existing settlements.
Considering that the brunt of American pressure will now be directed, in
accordance with the ""road map,"" against the settlements, it is very
important to renew the coalition agreement on this matter. And because
Labor is not likely to return to the coalition prior to elections, this
can only happy if elections are moved up.

Israel's ability to wage war against terrorist attacks, most of which
take place near the majority of the settlements, is liable to be
weakened when the Ministry of Defense is not occupied by a minister who
is at least formally identified with what is called in Israel ""the peace
camp."" Even at the height of the terrorism, the world behaved
hypocritically. Rather than supporting Israel when it was fighting
terrorism, it frequently supported the Arab terrorists. Now that Shaul
Mofaz is minister of defense, this tendency is likely to be
strengthened. And the settlers, who in any event have suffered the most
from this war of terror and attrition, are now liable to be attacked
even more heavily.

The staggering economy is liable to totter even further without a broad
coalition. The smaller factions within a narrow right wing coalition
will have the economic blackmail power they lacked in the previous
coalition. The settlers, with their commitment to what they call the
""community of Israel"" (Klal Yisrael), are certainly responsible in this
regard too. Accordingly they too should issue a call for early
elections, so that once the petty primaries that brought about the
collapse of the government are out of the way it will be possible to
reconstitute a broad coalition.

The prime minister should announce immediately that he has no intention
of fulfilling the ""prophecy"" of holding the elections on time, i.e., in
October 2003. He should opt for elections now, meaning in 90 days. Such
a responsible act would merit public appreciation. It would also deny
the left the opportunity to score points as a consequence of the ongoing
social and economic crisis or of other blunders--and there will be not a
few blunders--that take place during the tenure of a narrow coalition.

All the opinion polls predict that the parties of the right, led by the
Likud, will win a clear and unambiguous victory in the next elections.
Following the elections it would be for the best to return Labor to the
coalition; but if that does not happen, then better that there quickly
emerge in Israel a government that enjoys a stable majority not only
among the public, but in the Knesset as well.
"
"Pal","Neut","We now sit at a crossroads after two years of Intifada. Palestinians and
Israelis are further apart than ever and each side (especially the
Israeli side) is now making decisions that will affect the region for
generations to come. It is no surprise then that both parties, in the
same week, have experienced government upheaval.

Strikingly, and even though President Yasser Arafat seemed in more
trouble than Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Arafat has come out in pretty
good shape. One might even ask if what his people tried to explain seven
weeks ago as a ""setback"" was not really just one more tactic by this
political magician. It certainly appears that Arafat himself felt that
interior minister Abdel Rizaq Al Yehiya was making some decisions
without consulting him, and therefore used the chance to remove him.

Otherwise it is difficult to understand why Arafat's choice of cabinet
would have failed a vote of confidence seven weeks ago, but sail through
one today. The changes made in the cabinet selection were not so
significant. The only important change was the entrance of Hani Al Hasan
who is an influential Fateh Central Committee Member. Al Hasan is from
the German link of Fateh, has good ties to the Gulf States and was the
first Palestinian ambassador to Iran. There is no doubt that he is
politically stronger than Al Yahiya.

The only other major shift in the cabinet was the departure of Jamil
Tarifi as minister of civil affairs (despite that Tarifi will maintain
his powers as head of a ""bureau""). But despite the lack of real cabinet
reform, the Legislative Council vote, 56 for the cabinet and 18 against,
shows that Arafat still completely controls Fateh, the main political
force on the ground. After all the external effort to weaken the
Palestinian leader, this is truly amazing.

Heading his own new government, Sharon is likely to continue his
attempts to undermine Arafat. With a right-wing majority, it will be
easier to implement his three-pronged policy towards Palestinians: to
destroy what remains of the Authority, to continue to impede the peace
process and the ""roadmap,"" and (under the guise of the first two)
quietly continue the policy of colonizing Palestinian land. With this
extremist cabinet, Sharon will find it easier to implement the final
step in his third objective, which is the transfer of Palestinians from
the land. (It should be said, however, that attempts of this nature will
face a great number of problems, not least of which is Palestinians' own
memory of the ethnic cleansing of 1948.)

Initially, we can expect Sharon to repeat his performance of the spring
of 2001 when he exerted efforts to show that he is a statesman, not an
extremist. Eventually, however, he will show his true colors. One of the
things that is so remarkable about the Israeli government today is its
lack of internal checks. Palestinians can expect an even more difficult
situation on the ground, as it seems likely that settlers will be used
as a paramilitary arm with which to attack Palestinians. There is, of
course, the possibility that the introduction of settlers as a tool in
the violent conflict will lead to its eventual internationalization.

The swearing-in of former Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz as minister of
defense in the new Sharon cabinet raises the specter of further
militarization of Israeli society, and the politicization of the army.
Mofaz was one of the first ever chiefs of staff to speak so extensively
to the media. He publicly opposed the army's departure from Hebron, for
example, and argued in at least one cabinet meeting that Sharon must
exploit the opportunity at hand and drive Arafat out of Palestine for good.

This cabinet, while unprecedented in its right-wing credentials, is also
a mile marker in the history of Zionism. When Zionist leaders first
discussed creating a state, they thought of creating a modern liberal
state ""of Jews."" Theodore Herzl chose this wording deliberately,
rejecting the religious characteristics of ""a Jewish state."" Today,
however, we are seeing a new phenomenon, which is that the main
characteristic of the state of Israel is that of religion. In the short
term, this dramatic strategic shift will pose great difficulties and
dangers for Palestinians. In the long term, however, it will be Israel
that will pay the price.
"
"Isr","Neut","The Israeli intelligence agencies deserve the respect and admiration of
every Israeli and of every intelligence professional for their excellent
performance in the daily fight against Palestinian terrorism. The level
of their penetration into terrorist cells and the rate of success in
foiling terror attempts are amazing, especially taking into account that
the perpetrators of these attempts are aware of the risks and are taking
extreme precautions to avoid exposure.

At the same time, the intelligence agencies are playing an important
role on the strategic level in shaping the perceptions and the grasp of
reality of the decision makers and the public at large. But in these
areas their record is far from stellar. The recent example of the war in
Iraq shows how intelligence services in the United States, the United
Kingdom and Israel failed to present a perception of Iraq that
approximates reality. The reason for the discrepancy in performance
between the tactical and operational level on the one hand and the
strategic level on the other, lies in the difference between the nature
of intelligence that is needed in these two different domains.

In the first domain the intelligence professional traces specific steps
that are being taken by the adversary. This is done by collecting
concrete information about these steps and developing a system of clear
early warning indicators. In contrast, in the strategic domain one has
to analyze and understand long term and dynamic political processes and
identify political intentions. This is much more difficult, because only
seldom are there concrete and reliable data that enable this kind of
understanding. Usually understanding stems from analysis of the
political behavior of the other party and broad interpretation of the
available data, enabling the construction of conceptions that explain
the other party's behavior. But these interpretations and conceptions
are deeply affected by prior conceptions and prejudices held by the
intelligence analyst.

Another weakness of the intelligence analyst is his inclination to look
only at the other party and ignore the role of his own side. This
tendency makes it difficult to understand the dynamics of processes in
which the actions of the other side are in many cases only a reaction to
the actions of the analyst's side.

These problems explain why, during the last three years of violent
conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, we have repeatedly heard
about disagreements between Israeli military intelligence and the GSS
(General Security Service) on issues that pertain to understanding of
the Palestinian side of the conflict. One salient example is the debate
between the two services regarding the initial outbreak of violence.
While military intelligence described the intifada as a premeditated and
planned act decided by Arafat, GSS analysts tended to see it as a more
complex process in which spontaneous reactions and decisions with
unintended consequences played an important role.

A second example concerns the understanding of Hamas' behavior in the
last couple of months. Military intelligence argues that the leadership
of the organization decided to temporarily cease suicide bombings in
Israel, while the GSS denies there is such a decision and explains the
cessation of Hamas suicide bombings with reference to the successes of
the Israeli security community in foiling them.

The decisions of the political leadership in Israel, as well as the
views of the Israeli public, are derived to a great extent from their
perception of reality. This implies that through their intelligence
assessments, the intelligence agencies have considerable influence over
policy. This influence is not always benign.

A clear example of the problematic nature of the effect of intelligence
assessments is the phenomenon of self-fulfilling prophecies. If the
prevailing intelligence assessment holds that a certain Israeli action
will not achieve the hoped for results, then it is only natural that
this course will not be followed enthusiastically, leading to its
failure. That is exactly what happened during the Mahmoud Abbas (Abu
Mazen) government and the recent Palestinian hudna, or ceasefire. The
prevailing military intelligence assessment was that Abu Mazen's
government would fail to prevent terrorism and would eventually
collapse, and that the hudna would not hold. Accordingly the Israeli
authorities did not do all they could to help Abu Mazen, and Israel did
not restrain its military activities in a way that would afford a better
chance of success to Abu Mazen's government and the hudna, both of which
indeed collapsed. One cannot say with certainty that the same results
would not have been reached without Israeli actions and abstention from
acting, but certainly these had a role in the failures.

Leaders are tested in the way they use intelligence. They have to
understand the limitations of the intelligence agencies and the
problematic role they sometimes play, and not easily forego their own
reasoning and intuition. Because of their experience and the intuition
they develop during their political careers, in many cases political
leaders have a better and deeper understanding of the leaders on the
other side.
"
"Pal","Neut","Any comparative overview of intelligence capabilities between
Palestinians and Israelis can only begin by noting a tremendous
disparity. Arriving in Palestine in a hostile environment, the Jewish
settlers established rudimentary intelligence apparatuses as early as
1914. When the Jewish Agency was founded in the 1920s, it included an
Arab Affairs Department that collected information about the Palestinian
population and leadership.

Efficient intelligence was decisive in the 1948 War and with the
creation of the official Israeli army on May 26, 1948, the intelligence
branches took another form. Today, Israel's three main intelligence
agencies remain Aman, military intelligence; the Shabak (General
Security Service) which handles counterespionage and internal security,
including intelligence gathering in the occupied territories; and the
Mossad, created in 1951, which collects external intelligence, and is
entrusted with carrying out clandestine Jewish immigration (from Arab
countries, for example) and assassinations outside of Israel and the
occupied territories. Today Israel is making use of and developing some
of the most advanced intelligence gathering technology available,
including its Ofek satellite, communications sensors and unmanned
hovercraft.

On the other side, up until 1948, Palestinians did not have a single
formal intelligence body. Even the most advanced Palestinian
paramilitary organization, /Al Jihad al Muqadas/, led by Abdel Qader
Husseini, had no intelligence branch. After 1967, the major Palestinian
faction Fateh organized /Razd al Thawri/, which means ""revolutionary
intelligence"", led by Saleh Khalaf (Abu Eyad). But when Abu Eyad was
captured by the Jordanian forces in 1970 and ""broken"", he ordered by
radio that Palestinian fighters surrender--and was quickly replaced by
Ali Hassan Salameh, who was later assassinated by the Mossad in Beirut.

This negligence of intelligence capabilities is rather symptomatic of
the Palestinian performance altogether. Historically, the Palestinian
struggle has been mainly spontaneous, sacrificial and demanding great
resilience from the population, at the same time that political and
military institutions show lack of planning. The Arab states did not
help this situation, refusing to offer logistic support. But this is not
the only way to understand this huge failure. It is my point of view
that the Palestinian leadership, including Fateh, was never really
serious about armed struggle.

Later in the 70s, the primitive intelligence Palestinian centers, mainly
found in Fateh, were divided up among the ""Abus"", or the major
Palestinian leaders. Some of the leaders at that time had real
influence, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat used this method to
divide and rule (while security branches are historically competitive
the world over, among Palestinians this competition was used to absorb
dissent). After the Oslo accords with Israel, there were at least ten
security apparatuses in the Palestinian Authority, and according to the
agreements, they were not to collect information about the Israeli side.

Israeli intelligence infiltration into Palestinian life after 1967 was
particularly dramatic because the entire occupation system was set up to
force any Palestinian trying to carry out a mundane task to come in
contact with Israeli intelligence agents. If one only remembers that in
four years of Nazi occupation in Belgium during World War II, the Nazis
succeeded in ""turning"" 11 percent of the population, using these
converts to provide intelligence, imagine the state of Palestinians
after nearly 40 years of occupation, in which Palestinians have largely
been cut off from the support of the outside world. All indications are
that Israeli intelligence infiltrated the high ranks of security
apparatuses and Palestinian political organizations. Palestinians have
tried to deal with this through the extrajudicial killing and torture of
alleged collaborators. But these have often been the small fish or those
already ""burned""--those obviously working with the Israelis in supplying
permits, selling land or accompanying Israeli special forces.

There have been a handful of celebrated cases in which Palestinian
collaborators killed their own handlers. But if one considers the vast
number of Palestinian recruits, albeit many recruited against their
will, this number is relatively small. Many of these killings did not
result from a coordinated intelligence strategy, but from personal
initiative and the desire to inflict vengeance for humiliation incurred.
There have also been a handful of cases where Israelis have reported
being approached by the PLO to gather information. But these Israelis
were usually caught and arrested before they could do any damage, which
is just one more testimony to the effectiveness of Israel's intelligence
capabilities.

Finally, one arena that Israeli intelligence seems to have mastered (and
this is terribly pronounced in the media in the United States) is its
sophisticated manner of controlling the press. One of the main
departments of the Mossad deals with psychological warfare, propaganda
and operations of deception. But the great paradox here is that there is
also a great deal of ""real"" information about Israel in the press. While
Israel may not be a democracy for its Arab citizens, there is a large
body of security information to be found in the public domain. And in
truth, this is one more sign of the failure of Arab intelligence
efforts. Israelis are not afraid of releasing this information because
no one on the other side is paying attention.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: What is your impression of the election process that
brought Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) to the Palestinian premiership?

A: The process was disappointing in some ways, because of Arafat's
influence and his unwillingness to accept procedures that are supposed
to affect the mode of the war against terrorism. But the outcome is
positive from the standpoint of anyone who wants to arrive at a
political peace process.

Q: What is the government of Israel demanding of Abu Mazen
and his government?

A: What has happened within the Palestinian leadership was
intended primarily to advance those who recognize that it is Palestinian
society that requires a war against terrorism. Therefore, I don't want
to address this from the Israeli standpoint. This is first of all a
Palestinian interest. Palestinian society has been damaged by terrorism
at its deepest levels. So there is both a Palestinian internal interest
and a government interest.

From Israel's standpoint, in order to move forward the infrastructure of
terrorism must be eliminated. If any Israeli, right or left, wants to
advance a peace process, he will undoubtedly not do so if confronted by
a terrorist state. Hence both sides have an interest.

Q: What is your approach to the /hudna/ idea, a ceasefire
among the Palestinian factions, as a solution to terrorism?

A: This is a very disturbing idea. I fear this will not be
sufficient, will not provide the right road to the beginning of a
process, because the [terrorist] organizations will simply acquire more
weapons and prepare for the next round. A /hudna/ will provide imaginary
external quiet that will arouse deep fears among Israelis.

Q: Will the Americans suffice with a /hudna/?

A: The Americans aren't playing games here. We saw that in Iraq.

Q: Can you address the amendments that Israel is asking for
in the roadmap                                                 --the
additional demands upon the Palestinians?

A: One issue regarding which I have taken the lead is substantive.
President Bush is leading a solution of two states for the two peoples.
Therefore the historical deal will involve the creation of a Palestinian
state in the sense that this encompasses an arrangement for the [1948
Palestinian] refugees. Accordingly, the translation of Bush's speech
                                             [of June 24, 2002] into the
roadmap is defective. Hence I demanded that the discussion of a
Palestinian state be held simultaneously with the discussion of the
refugee problem.

Q: Perhaps your argument is with phase II of the roadmap.
After all, it moves up the discussion of one final status issue, a
Palestinian state, but delays the other final status issues to phase III.

A: Phase II as it stands is problematic, since it advances one
topic of final status. Therefore we must move the discussion of the
refugees to the same phase. This is the only way we can accept the roadmap.

Q: Perhaps the solution is simply to skip this problematic
phase II. . . ?

A: If we skip phase II this will return us to August 2000.

Q: Reportedly, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon suggested that
the Palestinians agree to define Israel as a Jewish state, perhaps
instead of renouncing the right of return at this time.

A: Defining Israel as a Jewish state is not sufficient because
this moves the issue to demographics, to a discussion of percentages,
and I'm talking about a matter of principle. If the establishment of a
Palestinian state does not provide a solution to the Palestinian people,
then there is no reason I should agree with it. I propose a solution
that moves both sides into the process.

Q: It's generally understood that Abu Mazen does not forego
the right of return at the level of principle.

A: I regret Abu Mazen's position regarding the right of return.
There's no point in the process unless we get this amendment.

Q: And if the US, which opposes any changes in the roadmap,
opposes the amendment you propose?

A: If the US opposes the change then I, who want to reach an
agreement, won't be able to support the process.

Q: Can you address the other Israeli comments on the roadmap?

A: There were additional amendments, for example regarding the
timetable for the process. Obviously the entire concept of phasing was
intended to move from one phase to the next in an atmosphere of
security. If the timetable is not clearly locked into performance tests,
this is insufficient.

Q: Isn't the process in any case likely to break down in
phases II and III in view of the clash between the views of Sharon and
Abu Mazen?

A: The process itself can be beneficial. If we see that there's
security in phase I, and a period of time passes during which we see
that the terrorist organizations have been eliminated and the textbooks
changed, then our readiness to compromise will also change. That's why
phasing may provide a better chance.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: How do you feel about the creation of the position of
prime minister?

A: This new government, and the appointment of a prime
minister, is a positive step towards developing and improving the
internal state of affairs and towards institution-building that will get
us to the point of establishing an independent Palestinian state.

Q: Do you feel that this change was the result of external
or internal pressure?

A: This was a Palestinian demand before it was an external
demand. The Palestinian demand corresponded with the international
demand, and the Palestinian Legislative Council agreed to it and the
Central Council agreed to it in principle. The Palestinian Legislative
Council then put it into law and amended the Basic Law.

Q: Some people seem irritated by the external pressures?

A: The irritation is at the external interference in the
formation of the government. In the end, though, there was agreement on
the names of the members of the new government, and a decision was made.
The Palestinian Legislative Council specified the powers of the prime
minister, while the president, Abu Ammar [Yasser Arafat], continues to
hold powers. The most important of these powers are that he appoints the
prime minister and can dismiss him at will. In the end, he remains
president.

Q: What does the new government plan to begin working on
first?

A: This government has an ambitious work plan. This plan
affirms that efforts should continue to end the occupation, to find a
solution for peace, and to obtain national rights for the Palestinian
people. The most important issue before the cabinet is the continuation
of reform and making laws operative. The most important laws that need
to be worked on are the social solidarity law, the parties law, and the
social security law.

There is also an opportunity before this government to continue
negotiations with the Israelis to apply the roadmap and reach a final
solution. The new government also has a responsibility to rebuild the
structure of all of the ministries and study their plans for the future.

Q: It was expected that Abu Mazen [Prime Minister Mahmoud
Abbas] would request a one-year ceasefire. Do you think he is moving in
this direction?

A: I think that Abu Mazen, the new government and Abu Ammar are
seeking to reach an understanding that will end the occupation and stop
violence on both sides.

Q: Four days ago, the roadmap
                                                 was made official?

A: The Executive Council of the Palestine Liberation
Organization and the previous and current cabinets demand Israeli
compliance with the roadmap. We agreed to the roadmap even though we
have many concerns over it, but as an international plan promoted by the
United States of America and the Quartet--the Europeans and the United
Nations and Russia--we accepted it, and ask that Israel agree to it.

Q: Are there indications from abroad that pressure will be
placed on Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in terms of the roadmap?

A: We say that the United States of America must not rule with
two different measures. It is able to force Israel, just as it has
forced major changes in the region. If it is serious about bringing
about a just peace, then it can pressure Israel.

Our goal is really only to live under a true and just peace that will
guarantee the Palestinian people's right to establish an independent
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, and a fair solution to
the issue of refugees--return of refugees on the basis of international
law. This is the message that Abu Mazen forwarded in his political
plans, for which he received the confidence of the Palestinian
Legislative Council.

Q: Your husband, Khalil al Wazir, was assassinated in Tunis
by Israeli operatives in 1988. When you remember Abu Jihad, how do you
think he would view the current situation?

A: Abu Jihad, may his soul rest in peace, was part of the
struggle to obtain an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as
its capital. It's true that Israel committed a heinous crime in the
assassination of Abu Jihad, but the interest of the people and our
belief in what he stood for is to continue in the struggle to obtain the
goal of all of the martyrs. The goal Abu Jihad was struggling for was
the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as
its capital, on all of the lands that were occupied in 1967. He believed
in this objective and he felt that we could obtain it by armed struggle.
If we can obtain it through peaceful negotiations, then we will have
also met our goal.

Q: In your view, are Palestinians closer or further from
this prospect?

A: That depends on the belief of the Israeli people in the
necessity and importance of peace. Abu Mazen was still taking his oath
of office as Israeli tanks and helicopters were invading the Gaza Strip
to commit a massacre in the Shuja'iyyeh neighborhood of Gaza City.
Twelve martyrs fell in this massacre, and more than 65 were wounded.
That was a poor message to send to the new prime minister.
"
"Isr","Neut","Ever since the occupation of the West Bank in 1967, there has been a
possibility of its return to Jordanian sovereignty or--at later
stages--a possibility that Jordan would resume an active role in its
affairs. Notwithstanding the Arab League's decision in November 1974 to
""delegate"" the PLO as claimant for the future of the territories, Jordan
remained the most salient candidate for a return of the territories to
Arab sovereignty.

This finally changed only with the failure of the Hussein-Peres
initiative of 1987 (which was rejected by Prime Minister Shamir) and the
outbreak of the first intifada, following which Jordan formally declared
its disengagement from the affairs of the territories. The Oslo accords
appeared initially to create a positive framework for
Israeli-Palestinian agreement, thus finally settling the conflict. The
course of events since then, and especially the outbreak of the second
intifada, led to a major deterioration in Israeli-Palestinian relations
and to increased doubts that they could be repaired.

Until Jordan decided on its disengagement from the West Bank in the late
1980s, its interests there were clear and understandable. First, the
West Bank was an integral part of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which
sought to restore its sovereignty there. Second, control over the holy
places in Jerusalem had been one of the main reasons for the Jordanian
intervention in Palestine in 1948 and remained a critical goal for the
kingdom. Third, the emergence of a Palestinian state in the West Bank
that could become irredentist toward the East Bank might be a cause for
concern unless arrangements were made that would effectively limit such
tendencies. These goals and concerns indeed dictated an active policy of
engagement by Jordan.

Presently however, in view of the enormous tasks and problems that the
kingdom faces--national consolidation, the buttressing of a specific
/Jordanian/ national identity, and severe economic challenges--the
tendency of the regime and political elites in Jordan is to reject
significant reengagement in the affairs of Palestine. This position
appears indeed to be realistic and to possess internal logic.

Clearly, therefore, Jordan is not currently ready to shoulder a major
responsibility for the West Bank or to seek to assign itself the role of
principal interlocutor with Israel concerning its future. Yet at the
same time any major development in Palestine would ineluctably affect
Jordan, thus requiring a measure of Jordanian activity or at least prior
planning. For example, extreme Israeli punitive actions in reaction to
Palestinian terrorism might lead to Palestinian migration to Jordan.
(Jordanian concern about the location of the separation fence is a case
in point.) Indeed, precisely for the very reasons that Jordan now
prefers non-engagement, it might have to modify its position if
circumstances change.

Analytically, one could differentiate between several categories of
possible Jordanian involvement. First, following the establishment of a
Palestinian state, there might be moves toward the establishment of some
type of deep cooperation between Jordan and Palestine. While such a
scenario does not require very salient short-term activity, it might
nevertheless call for a measure of planning as well as Jordanian
attention to the conditions attendant on the formation of a Palestinian
state, be it as a result of unilateral Israeli withdrawal or of an
agreement.

Second, Jordan may wish to be active in well-defined issue areas where
its interests are paramount, such as the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif.
Jordan has never given up its interests there; they are recognized
formally in the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty.

Third, Jordan could play an active role in the process leading to the
establishment of a Palestinian state. While this is less likely, it is
not impossible, insofar as it is difficult to predict and assess future
developments.

One might wonder whether Jordan--precisely in order to protect its vital
national interests as a /Jordanian/ state--might not find itself
compelled to reengage if critical circumstances changed: first and
foremost, if there were a readiness on the part of significant sectors
in the Palestinian community to accept such a Jordanian role. This could
result, for example, from continued deterioration of the situation in
the West Bank and the collapse of the Palestinian Authority or,
alternatively, as a consequence of advanced Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations that touch on important Jordanian interests, and a decision
to invite Jordan to take part in them. In any event, the objective would
be the establishment of a stable Palestinian state.

The part of the Israeli public that is genuinely interested in peace and
security would most probably prefer some form of Jordanian reengagement
in developments in the West Bank. It should be clear, however, that the
best way to facilitate such a move--to the extent that it depends on the
Israeli side--is for Israel to be more accommodating in terms of
withdrawal from territories and concessions in Jerusalem and the holy
places.

Jordan, the Palestinian community, and Israel find themselves in a bind.
Political, strategic, demographic, and economic developments in the West
Bank affect all of them. There is a need for much more thinking and
planning on the part of all three actors with regard to their future
interrelationships.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: According to the Israeli daily /Haaretz/, Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon told his cabinet on June 1st that his plan to
disengage from the Gaza Strip might include a Jordanian presence in the
West Bank. What would be the advantage to Israel of such an arrangement?

A: I think that what Sharon says is just for Israeli and
international public opinion to market himself as a peacemaker, but
nothing will happen in the next six to seven months. Sharon is always
talking about peace while doing things on the ground [that contravene
peace]. About a Jordanian, Egyptian, or any Arab role, this is not
clear. He may plan for a Jordanian role, but the other parties have to
participate in these plans. The Egyptian side has agreed to a role; up
to now we haven't heard from Jordan.

Sharon can't put conditions on Egypt or Jordan in order to disengage
from Gaza. The Israelis are disengaging because they have come to the
conclusion that they cannot rule over the Palestinian people. This
statement was made for the benefit of the public and his party.

Q: What would be the pros and cons of such a role--training
police, advising, etc.--for Jordan?

A: There have been no arrangements for disengagement from the
West Bank, so the Jordanian role of giving advice on security is not
clear. It will be two to three years before Israel's plans for the West
Bank are clear. Sharon wants to leave the Gaza Strip and continue
occupying the West Bank forever while declaring it legal according to
the Americans. The real battle will be in the West Bank.

The Jordanians will not be interested in a role in the West Bank,
because history is going forward, not backward. Jordan is stable now,
and its government will think many times before taking on such a role in
the West Bank. Jordan has no interest in the West Bank at this time,
because the Palestinian issue could threaten the stability of the
kingdom and upset the delicate balance between majority and minority.

Q: Would the Palestinian Authority welcome a Jordanian role
in disengagement? Where could Jordan be useful?

A: The PA will accept a Jordanian role in training the
security forces in Palestine. We want Arab participation in the building
of our own state and the training of our people, but any other role is
not accepted. The Palestinian people want all Arab countries to stand on
our side against the Israeli occupier. We will not accept for any Arab
country to be a mediator. We accept them as partners.

Q: What about the militias and the Palestinian street?

A: We have good relations with all Arab countries and Arab
people; they all help us in this catastrophe in which we live. Jordan
and Egypt are good supporters of the Palestinian cause. Having good
relations with Jordan is acceptable to everyone, but any other role is
not appropriate at this time.

Sharon's plan is just a bluff to show the world that he is a peacemaker,
but we are sure that he is a killer. He is trying to involve Arab
countries in this conflict as mediators.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: What is your forecast regarding the water shortage in
the Palestinian Authority?

A: The water shortage in Gaza is catastrophic. The quality of
water is also catastrophic. In the Gaza Strip they need an additional 30
to 40 million cubic meters of water a year for drinking. Nothing will
help but desalinating seawater or brackish water and building an
advanced water system, and establishing a modern sewage system. We know
where the desalination plant will be located, and American funds for
construction have been allocated, including for a central distribution
pipeline the length of the Strip. The plans are ready, but you can't
build under fire. You don't even need peace, just a ceasefire. The cost
to Palestinians (operation and maintenance costs, without capital
return) will be 35-40 cents per cubic meter if the Americans build the
installation as a grant.

Q: And in the West Bank?

A: South of Jerusalem there is a shortage of water, and many
villages are not hooked up to water systems. In our extended talks with
the Palestinians they were presented with proposals for increasing
supply immediately: some 30 wells to be drilled in the area of the
""nature reserve"" transferred under the Wye agreement, which would supply
25 million cubic meters a year to the Hebron and Yatta regions. Here
again, the drilling is not taking place due to the Intifada. The plans
and permissions were delivered to the Palestinians in January 2001. The
Americans have to drill the wells, which are deep and expensive and
require peace and quiet. Israel is prepared to give all the technical
support. There are additional reserves of water in the Judea area.

North of Jerusalem there are no more unexploited water sources and there
is no solution but to bring desalinated water from the Mediterranean
Sea. I have proposed that the international community build a
desalination plant at Hadera with a supply pipeline to the northern West
Bank. The Americans will build the facility and the additional donor
countries perhaps will lay the distribution pipes for the Palestinians.
Israel will allocate the land and give the international consortium the
right of way for the pipeline. This solution supplies unlimited
quantities of quality water; even the sewage created by using this water
will be of an improved quality that is more suitable for purification
and recycling for agriculture. In view of international involvement the
Palestinians will have no fear of Israel stopping the flow due to an
emergency situation, and no dependency on Israel. The cost will be about
50 cents per cubic meter, including delivery, on condition that the
international community builds the installations as grants, compared to
50-60 cents the Palestinians pay today to Israel's Mekorot company.

Q: What is delaying this solution for the northern West Bank?

A: If the Palestinians say yes, the Americans are prepared to
request the funds. With the Europeans it's more a matter of talk at this
point. But there is no agreement with the Palestinians because some of
them are still insisting on water rights from aquifers that in any case
are empty and becoming saline. In other words, some of the Palestinians
who deal with this issue are in the ideological phase, not the phase of
pragmatic solutions.

Q: Can this desalination solution help Jordan too?

A: Yes. We can enlarge the facility at Hadera and extend the
pipeline to Jordan.

Q: How do you relate to the proposal to import water from
Turkey?

A: Importing from Turkey is still problematic because the use of
oil tankers for transporting drinking water still has to be tested. If
the experiments of a certain Israeli company succeed in producing
alternative means of importing drinking water via the sea, we'll have
another option. Water from Turkey for Jordan and the Palestinians will
cost some 30 cents per cubic meter, less than the cost of desalinated
water (without capital return). Perhaps for a period of time the Turks
won't charge the Palestinians and Jordanians for the water, as aid to
fellow Muslim countries.

Q: Can sewage recycling be solved the way water issues are
dealt with?

A: Sewage purification and recycling and prevention of
contamination of water supplies are no less important than water supply
itself. The problems involved in operating sewage recycling plants are
greater than managing water systems. So the international community will
not only have to build these plants for the Palestinians as grants, but
subsidize operations as well for several decades. We in Israel are most
interested in sewage purification in the West Bank because of the flow
down from there into our water sources. But recycling in Gaza is no less
important.

Q: Finally, in view of the Intifada, what is the current
status of cooperation on water issues between Israel and the Palestinians?

A: The cooperation framework set up between the two sides is a
good one. It is holding firm even under fire. The commitment each side
gave the other, to help one another even under difficult conditions is,
in general, working. There are repairs, there is instruction, spare
parts are delivered and water is distributed--all in the spirit of good
will prevailing since the interim agreements.
"
"Pal","Neut","The Middle East is one of the world's most water-stressed regions, and
the deteriorating quality and limited capacity of the region's water
resources are of paramount importance to all residents of the area.

Since much of the freshwater that is available in Israel and the
Palestinian Occupied Territories comes from shared sources i.e.,
groundwater and surface water, water has been a subject of several
Israeli-Palestinian agreements namely: the Declaration of Principles of
1993, the Gaza-Jericho Accord of 1995, and the Interim Agreement on the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip of 1995 (hereinafter ""Interim Agreement"").
As a number of issues related to water were not resolved definitively in
the Interim Agreement, water was listed as one of the main subjects to
be negotiated in the permanent status negotiations.

Until the Interim Agreement, the water resources of the Occupied
Territories were under the direct control of the Israeli military
government, which in turn was guided in its policies by domestic Israeli
government institutions, including the Water Commission. The Commission
drastically limited Palestinian access to and use of freshwater from
aquifers in the Occupied Territories. In contrast, however, it has
allowed illegal Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories vastly
greater consumption of the same water sources. On average, when
including Israelis living inside the Green Line, Israelis consume more
than four times as much water as Palestinians on a per capita basis.

Under the Interim Agreement, the situation did not improve much for the
Palestinians. Israel retains veto power over Palestinian development not
only of groundwater that is shared with Israel but also that which is
wholly Palestinian, in the sense that it does not flow from the
territories into Israel. The disparities remain blatantly inequitable
and unreasonable.

Israel does not attempt to justify its disproportionate share of the
international water resources such as the Mountain Aquifer and the
Jordan River Basin under the doctrine of equitable utilization. Instead,
to the extent that Israel has attempted to justify its conduct on legal
grounds at all, it has relied on its prior use of the water resources.
The prior use or historic use doctrine states that a pattern of use of
water in an international watercourse gives rise to a right to such use.
This argument is baseless for two fundamental reasons:

One of the most fundamental principles of international law is that no
benefit can be derived from an illegal act (ex injuria non oritur jus).
Israel's belligerent occupation of the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 is
unlawful. Even if its occupation were not unlawful, Israel's conduct in
administering the Occupied Territories and exploiting Palestinian
natural resources violates its obligations as an occupying power under
the law of ""belligerent occupation"" (the 1907 Hague Regulations and the
Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949), and also violates the principle of
Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources.

With regard to water from the Jordan River, Israel's unlawful military
actions have enabled it to appropriate more than an equitable share of
the waters of the Jordan River basin. Its occupation of the Golan
Heights and, until recently, the ""security zone"" in southern Lebanon,
contrary to United Nations Security Council resolutions, have resulted
in Israeli control of many of the headwaters of the Jordan River.
Furthermore, Israel expelled Palestinians from the area of the West Bank
bordering the Jordan River, destroyed Palestinian wells (including wells
built pre-1967), denied access by Palestinians to Jordan River water
resources, and established settlements (most of which are agricultural)
in the strip of land bordering the River, all in violation of the law of
belligerent occupation and laws on the use of international
watercourses. These unlawful actions have enabled Israel to divert
water, drill wells, and otherwise appropriate water to which it would
otherwise not have been entitled. International law does not permit
Israel to profit from its illegal actions.

As mentioned, Israel has defended its present allocation of water on the
ground of ""prior use."" But if prior use conferred absolute rights, as
Israel appears to claim, states such as Turkey and the United States
would have been sharply restricted in the development of their
international watercourses, in particular the Euphrates and the Rio
Grande respectively, and Ethiopia would be virtually precluded from any
development of the Blue Nile. But this is not the law.

According to international law, the fundamental principle is that
international watercourses must be used in an equitable manner. Article
6 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses
of International Watercourses, (1997) included ""existing"" uses as one of
the factors that may be relevant in determining equitable
utilization--i.e. in the present case, in arriving at an equitable
apportionment of waters shared between Palestine and Israel. Although
""existing"" uses may also be ""prior"" uses, neither of these circumstances
is automatically entitled to a particular weight in the balancing
process that is employed to arrive at an equitable apportionment.

For the above-mentioned reasons, the present allocation of water from
sources shared by Israel and the Palestinians violates the rules of
international law. Israel's use is inequitable because it cannot be
justified according to the factors relevant to equitable and reasonable
utilization. The West Bank is the recharge source of much of Israel's
water (80-85 percent of rainwater entering into the shared aquifers).
The Palestinian population in the Occupied Territories is more than half
that of Israel, yet Israel permits Palestinians to consume much less
water per capita than Israelis. In addition, Israel's use is
unreasonable because much of it is subsidized or otherwise wasteful, and
because it has been accomplished largely through the forcible prevention
of the Palestinians from gaining access to their rightful share.

If the Palestinian and Israeli people are going to live as ""equal
neighbors,"" the principles of equity and equality must form part of the
peace process itself. A peace agreement that is made at the further
expense of the Palestinian people's rights and needs will not achieve
that result--on the contrary, it will only serve to strengthen the sense
of injustice and national grievance among the Palestinian people, and
would not therefore produce a meaningful, durable and sustainable peace.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: What in your view is the strategic significance of the
road map in its latest version?

Shoval: For several reasons, I'm not certain to what extent the new
version, or its predecessor or its successor will be relevant for the
process. First, I assume the American approach will undergo certain
changes after the campaign in Iraq. The Bush administration has already
stated that the road to Jerusalem leads through Baghdad. Secondly, a lot
depends on the elections in Israel. It's not only that ""all politics is
local,"" but in concrete terms, if [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon
establishes a rightist government or one with Labor, there will be
different ramifications on the Israeli approach to the map.

At another level, the title of the road map hasn't changed from version
to version [""Road Map to a Permanent Two-State Solution""], but there
remain many question marks as to whether the final objective, two
states, will indeed constitute a permanent solution. We're discussing
""an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state living side by
side in peace and security with Israel,"" but what guarantee does the
world have that somehow it will be different from every other state in
the Arab world, when even according to Secretary of State Powell there
is no such state in the region? I assess that these issues will come up
for discussion, but after the campaign in Iraq. In any event, no plan
will be viable without the agreement of the State of Israel.

Q: Perhaps the Americans are not really serious about it...

Shoval: The Americans definitely would like, if not an ideal peace, then
at least to contain the ferocity of the conflict, if only for the sake
of coalition-building. But the preeminent geopolitical approach in this
administration holds that the Palestinian conflict is not the principal
cause of instability in the Middle East, and this view only became
stronger after the events of 9/11.

Q: What aspects of the new road map appear particularly
problematic?

Shoval: First of all, the emphases on fixed timetables, and the fact
that many of the two sides' obligations are scheduled simultaneously.
True, the title presents the road map as ""performance-based,"" but the
performance tests are not strong enough, and the ""not later than""
stipulations are troublesome. For example, it is not desirable that the
passage from phase I to phase II be determined by the Quartet. Secondly,
the plan ignores the refugee issue, which constituted the primary reason
for the failure of Camp David/Taba. While we are not here dealing with
final status issues, it should nevertheless be stated explicitly that
the problem will be solved by settling the refugees in the Arab world.

The stipulation that phase II will produce a Palestinian state ""with
provisional borders and attributes of sovereignty"" constitutes a step
backwards compared to President Bush's call on June 24, 2002 for a
""provisional state."" The freezing of natural growth of settlements at
such an early stage is also problematic; for how long? Suppose the
process takes time and is even frozen. Thus there should be
conditionality attached to the freeze.

Q: By the way, how do you understand the call in phase II,
the phase of a state with provisional borders, for the ""implementation
of prior agreements, to enhance maximum territorial contiguity,
including further action on settlements""?

Shoval: They mean the removal of settlements that impede contiguity.

Q: Additional positive or negative points in the plan?

Shoval: On the positive side, no doubt there is an improvement in the
security demands presented to the Palestinians. But our withdrawal to
the September 28 lines should be conditioned explicitly on an end to
violence. I also wonder if it's wise to offer ""international recognition
of Palestinian state, including possible UN membership"" as early as
phase II. Finally, there is no specific demand for the removal of
Arafat; this reflects the UN and EU approach and not the American
approach, and is unfortunate.

Q: The road map contains a commitment to ""end the occupation
that began in 1967."" How do you interpret this?

Shoval: Unfortunately President Bush also used this expression in his
June 24 speech. Israel, including the Labor Party, does not see the end
of the conflict in these terms, and does not interpret UNSC Resolution
242 as meaning a return to the Green Line. I'm not happy with this. It's
a ""slippery slope."" But in the final analysis even a national government
of the center and right will have to deal with the settlements on the
basis of our priorities. Even a modus vivendi arrangement with the other
side, not peace, would justify this.

Q: Why in your opinion is the Palestine Liberation
Organization not mentioned in this document as the partner for future
agreements with Israel? After all, the Oslo agreements were signed with
the PLO and not with the Palestinian Authority.

Shoval: This is confirmation that Oslo is dead.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What are your comments on the revised road map document?

A: The document that I have seen, in my opinion, speaks
generally. There is no specificity on many issues and that leads the way
open before Israel not to be tied down to what I think is important for
realizing the needed peace.

Q: Does that mean, then, that you do not trust Israel?

A: Israel has not abandoned any of its claims voiced at the
first Zionist Congress until this moment. If I am mistaken, correct me.
Where has Israel in any way tempered or abandoned any of its claims from
long ago? As far as I am concerned, all that has happened is consistent
with those Israeli claims. All of our readiness to accommodate in one
way or another has not tempered Israel from continuing on its path.

For instance, Israel is engaging in settlement activity that started in
1967 and was condemned by numerous UN resolutions, to no avail. Israel
has riddled the occupied territories with settlements, and now they
represent facts on the ground that Israel is not ready to concede. We
are really in a difficult situation.

Q: In your view then, the way to peace is for Israel to
actively denounce those claims?

A: Our declared position--that we accept a state within the
borders of 1967 with all that is needed for a real and sovereign
Palestinian state--is a big concession on our part. However, Israel
after its 1967 occupation took all efforts to frustrate realization of
that. What else can one say?

I think that our declared position is the minimum that we can accept.
Really, we are willing and we are sacrificing to reach the needed peace
and we are very sincere in this. I am very sorry that Israel has been
creating obstacles.

Q: You have previously been very critical of the Palestinian
Authority. Where do you think that the Palestinian national cause is
heading?

A: I am not satisfied at all with the performance of our
Authority. Mostly, we are carrying on an unorganized struggle and so we
are losing. I feel very sorry about the severe losses that we are
enduring. Certainly, [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon is exploiting
our situation of disarray to inflict unprecedented damage. I am also
critical of the democratic world that stands by and does not say
anything about what Sharon is doing to us.

Q: From your experience as a negotiator, do you think that
Palestinians can and should seek American support? Is it possible to go
it alone?

A: We need the support of everyone, not only the Americans.
Certainly it is difficult to go it alone, although I do believe that if
we are able to prevail on ourselves and organize properly, that would
probably cause Israel to depart from its present stand, which exploits
our lack of organization.

Q: If you are discouraged with the Palestinian struggle and
with current attempts to make peace, where then do you get your hope?

A: The matter is to organize properly, and I think that unless
we organize, we are doomed. I say that quite frankly. But once we start
to organize whatever little potential we have, that will be the cause
for Israel to depart from its aggressive stance.

Q: Then from your perspective, this road map isn't going
anywhere?

A: My guess is that this road map is not going to be accepted
by Sharon and that he will do everything to scuttle it, even if the
Palestinians accept it. I am sorry to make you feel that I am so
negative, but I speak sincerely when I say that I wish to see positive
signs from the Israeli side that they are really ready to concede to our
very modified position.

Now, in the face of what Israel has established on the ground, much talk
and thought is required over what is a viable thing for us Palestinians.
Do you really think that the Israeli leadership, in light of what has
been established on the ground, will agree to grant the Palestinians
something viable?
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: The government led by Ariel Sharon appears to be moving
Israel toward a regional or international conference. Isn't this a
slippery slope, a trap?

A: The central question is whether bringing a third party into the
conflict constitutes a loss of control over my fate and endangers my
existence? A regional conference is a positive idea, since [Palestinian
leader Yasser] Arafat has proven he's not a partner, and I and the
Palestinian people share an interest in reaching a settlement, peace and
stability. Egypt, Jordan and the United States have a similar interest
in view of the ramifications of the conflict for them. We can agree to
such a process. But it's impossible to hold such a convocation
completely without Arafat--even though he is not the leader who will
bring his people to peace.

I'm not happy to discover that there is no Palestinian partner, and
therefore I'm looking for additional actors who will dilute Arafat's
control. Together with them we can define a joint interest; hence
Israel's initiative to convene a regional conference. Still, it's
important that we retain the capacity to prevent an imposed settlement.
I'm not in the same camp as Shlomo Ben Ami [Israeli foreign minister
under Ehud Barak], who is prepared for the world to decide for us.

Q: What should be on the agenda of such a conference?

A: The Israeli public is now afraid of a Camp David-style solution
and fears to find itself living alongside a terrorist state. In any
event, Arafat is not interested in ending the conflict. Thus it is a
mistake today to enter into an accelerated, dramatic process that
produces a terrorist state. As an alternative we must look for a way to
generate a normal Palestinian order of life based on territorial
contiguity. We need to discuss economic and humanitarian relief, the
prevention of friction with our soldiers and the cessation of terrorism
and incitement. We must not place time limits on the process. We can
agree to discuss final status, and within that framework look for
interim territorial understandings that reduce pressures. The Arab
countries that aspire to represent the Palestinian cause will not tell
us it's ""all or nothing"".

Q: Israeli Intelligence circles have long argued that it is
Arafat who seeks to ""internationalize"" the conflict. How does a Likud
minister arrive at a readiness to go to an international conference? How
do you explain the evolution of this approach?

A: After Camp David I understood that Arafat does not want to end
the conflict. During Israel's last elections fate brought together two
actors: one, Arafat, who doesn't want to end the conflict, and the
other, Sharon, who presents a program for an interim settlement. This
was a better match than Barak-Arafat. Following the creation of the
Sharon government we embraced proposals that could advance this
approach, such as Tenet and Mitchell.

With the passage of events we realized that Arafat was not even capable
of reaching an interim agreement, and that an alternative Palestinian
leadership, while a good option, was impossible and unrealistic. That
brought us to a readiness to deliberate with more moderate Arab and
international actors.

Q: What is your attitude toward the now cancelled United
Nations fact-finding commission on Jenin?

A: There are two problems here. First, Israel finds itself in a
bizarre situation vis-a-vis the international community. By definition
we share its values: democracy, equality, moral values. In terms of
applying norms, we are partners and the Palestinians are not. Yet the
international community ignores Palestinian violations of norms while
taking a very strict approach with us. The second problem is that we
have no trust or belief in either the judge or the tribunal. Here for
example is Syria, a member of the Security Council, that supports
terrorism yet participates in decisions on normative humanitarian
issues. There's almost no place where we can get a fair hearing. The
Jenin affair spotlighted the problem, but it's not new.

Q: Can't the UN be helpful in border issues?

A: In Lebanon in May 2000 we carried out Security Council Resolution
425 fully. Yet the UN still does not enforce a ceasefire on Hizballah,
and even became entangled in the abduction affair of our soldiers.

Q: What's your attitude toward European involvement?

A: Arafat will try to bring the European community, which supports
him, into the process. In my view the European position is based on an
unacceptable double standard. Europe confuses its empathy for the
Palestinians with the messages it sends Arafat, which are understood by
him as a green light to continue his terrorism. Note, for example,
British Prime Minister Blair's embrace of Arafat three weeks after
September 11.

Q: Is there room for an international military force in a
solution to the conflict?

A: Certainly as observers following an agreement. But I have a
problem with an international military force that is deployed here to
separate the two sides. It will create a technical separation without
terrorism ending, while it ties my hands and keeps me from fighting
back.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: How can international involvement or a conference help the
situation now?

A: I think that neither side is ready to come to a resolution or to
compromise now--in particular the Israeli side. The Israelis don't have
any real intentions of entering into a political solution. If they do go
for that, it will be an agreement for forty percent of the West Bank and
to postpone the real issues. This offer will not attract anyone on the
Palestinian side.

In order to be successful, an international conference should have a
clear basis with the clear terms of reference of [United Nations
Resolutions] 242 and 338 and also, not address how to ""explain"" these
international references, but how to implement them. These resolutions
have already been compromised.

Q: When are the conditions ripe for international involvement?

A: When both sides are tired. They are tired now. The Palestinians
are always asking for international intervention, which means they are
feeling the negative effects. The Israelis know they cannot win--even if
they conquer all of the West Bank, this military achievement will not be
a political one. The Palestinians also realize that the Israelis can
defeat them militarily, but not politically.

In these circumstances there should be a third party to pressure the
Israelis towards international legality. But as long as the United
States is that party, it will intervene one way or another on the side
of Israel. Also, there is another obstacle, which is that after
September 11, the Americans are looking to fight terrorism and have put
Iraq on the agenda. [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon prefers that,
when the American attack on Iraq happens, it be without [Palestinian
leader Yasser] Arafat. But the US is afraid of the consequences of
getting rid of Arafat. This can be seen in their double position. They
don't know how to deal with him. The Arab states are trying to tell them
that you should go with Arafat and that if you do not, this will be a
destabilizing factor.

Q: The United States administration is making some statements
now addressing the Palestinian occupation, chastising the Israelis. They
seem to be making an effort to appear balanced. What kind of approach
would convince you that their international intervention might work?

A: I think that there should be promises, real ones, with
guarantees and a down payment. This might happen: a withdrawal of the
Israeli army and the lifting of the siege. But the Israelis also want a
down payment. Yesterday, Sharon was saying that they will not let
Palestinians blackmail them. This means that this is tit-for-tat: if we
keep up our military operations, they will keep up their attacks.

Q: For some time, Arafat has shown himself a true believer in
the caveat that only the United States can deliver Palestinian freedom.
Do you think that his thoughts on this have changed at all lately?

A: No, of course not. He is not the only one to believe this. The
United States is the only party who can do anything.

Q: Well, perhaps he might change to focus on making changes
inside Israeli society, for example...

A: I believe in this approach, but it will take ten years. [For
Arafat], this is not the time for this. There is mistrust. Personally, I
can say that I have always had contacts with Israelis from Peace Now,
for example, but it is really hard now. I just feel that if they don't
condemn what is going on in the Palestinian territories that there is no
basis for anything. In the past, there was, but now something is broken.

I do think that Palestinians should address Israeli public opinion in
another way. The suicide attacks in Israel have destroyed all the
bridges between us and allowed the Israeli right wing to say that this
is not a conflict against occupation, but against Israel itself. The
settlers are now saying, ""The settlements are not the issue, look at
what they are doing in Jerusalem, in Tel Aviv.""

Q: Do you think that more Palestinians are saying this?

A: No, this is not a popular viewpoint among Palestinians. I just
want to know why it is that the Iranian Prime Minister goes to Hezballah
and asks him to stop attacks on Israel, so as not to give Sharon an
excuse to attack, but here it is not all right to ask Hamas to do the
same thing. It indicates that there is a political agenda from outside.
While it is true that those who are doing these attacks are sacrificing
themselves for the Palestinian cause and the Islamic cause, the
Palestinian people themselves should not commit collective
suicide.
"
"Isr","Neut","Hunger strikes by terrorist prisoners in the facilities of the Israel
Prison Service are a periodic ritual, repeated every few years when
prisoners judge the circumstances to be ripe. Let me note at the outset
that the state of individual rights and the prison conditions of
security prisoners and detainees in these facilities are very good in
comparison with any parallel population of terrorists or terror suspects
in the world, and particularly in the West. Witness, for example, the
conditions of prisoners held by the United States in Guantanamo and in
Abu Ghraib and other prisons in Iraq. This judgment is reflected in the
human rights report disseminated by the US State Department for 2003:
""In general, conditions in the Israel Prison Service's facilities accord
with international standards"".

In the course of the past two and a half years there has been a steady
erosion of ""benefits"", i.e., additional privileges not mandated by law,
by international convention or by orders--the kind awarded to prisoners
as a humanitarian gesture and on condition that they do not contravene
state or prison security rules. This erosion was a direct consequence of
the violation of these conditions by the prisoners, including the
planning and directing of terrorist attacks from jail, attacking and
wounding of prison staff, attempting escape, and smuggling of forbidden
goods into prison. Among the prisoners are dozens of suicide bombers who
failed to carry out their mission, and who have no inhibitions about
carrying out a suicide mission aimed at as many representatives of the
""enemy"" as possible.

Until recently, despite this dynamic, the prisoners had not reacted in
an organized manner. They well understood that every privilege denied
them and that degraded their living conditions, was a direct reciprocal
consequence of the disobeying of orders and violation of security. Thus,
the smuggling of a cellular phone in a baby's diaper ended unrestricted
meetings and physical contact with children at the close of family
visits, while the smuggling of a phone in the genital area led to a
renewal of strip searches of both prisoners and visitors.

The prisoners eventually announced their intention to strike, ostensibly
in protest at this erosion in conditions, even though in the course of
the past year no further deterioration had taken place, with the
exception of glass barriers replacing screens at family visits--this,
too, due to the smuggling of goods and messages, including instructions
for terrorist acts. The real circumstances for the strike were, in my
assessment, as follows:

For one, internal dynamics within the Palestinian Authority were at
play: the prisoners' sensed that the public had forgotten them; there
was rivalry among factions that had senior representatives jockeying for
leadership in jail; and the strike was an opportunity for the
Palestinian leadership to divert public opinion from domestic anarchy.

Secondly, the decision to strike was affected by political issues,
including the anticipated unilateral Israeli disengagement without
negotiations, the ongoing difficulty in carrying out acts of hard
terrorism (punctuated by the Beersheva attack, some two and a half weeks
into the strike), the recognition that the near future holds no likely
prisoner release, and the hope placed on Hizballah as the only possible
vehicle for release.

At the bureaucratic level of the Prison Service and the Ministry for
Public Security, the arrival of a new prisons commissioner a year ago
and a policy review led the prisoner leadership to assess the time was
ripe for a confrontation with the sovereign power.

Finally, at the international level, there was an attempt to ride the
""wave"" created by the recommendation of the International Court of
Justice at The Hague regarding the security fence and the related
declaration of the United Nations, in order to generate pressure on
Israel as a violator of the rights of both civilians and ""freedom
fighters"" and to de-legitimize steps it takes against terrorism in the
territories and the prisons.

But in the case at hand, the calculations of both the security prisoners
and the Prison Service appear to have been lacking.

The extremist prisoner leadership miscalculated the likelihood of
influencing public opinion in Israel, the territories and the world.
Around the globe, attention was focused on the Olympic Games. The brutal
suicide bombings in Beersheva eliminated any residual chance to hold the
world's interest. Moreover, the prisoners thought they could hold a
""deluxe"" strike and continue to drink nourishing liquids like milk, soup
and juice and receive other additives like salt. But the Prison Service
rejected this request and left them with water alone, to the point where
some strikers abandoned the strike on their own, while others were
eventually given liquids and additives on doctors' orders.

The Prison Service publicized the strike long before it began, thereby
generating a momentum that obliged the prisoners to strike even if their
heart was not in it. At this stage there was even talk of possible
negotiations over some of the prisoners' ""demands"", thereby energizing
the strike yet further. This added an additional factor of confusion:
demands with regard to rules and conditions are within the sole
authority of the sovereign, i.e., the state by means of the Prison
Service, while prisoners can only request improved conditions. This is
not a negotiating situation between, say, the State of Israel and the
Palestinian Authority. Moreover, the strike could have been ""broken""
before it began by providing the extra liquids and additives and
publishing the fact that in reality there is no strike at all, thereby
neutralizing public and international interest.

Under these circumstances it appears that neither the sovereign nor the
prisoners gained much from the strike. This was one more round that
ended in stalemate, part of a long war that is waged behind bars as well
as beyond. The prisoners, the PA leadership and the sovereign all knew
that we would not concede one iota of security, and that no substantive
change in prison conditions was possible as long as terrorists continue
their struggle and exploit every opening to attack.

On the other hand, the bitterness and frustration caused by the present
situation are liable to generate acts more extreme than deluxe hunger
strike protests. Sadly, the extremists among the prisoner leadership
only enhanced their power and negative influence, while the more
moderate leadership continues to lose power and influence.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: We hear the strike is suspended. Is it temporary,
pending negotiations, or is the strike finished? Might it start again?

A: We have received information that the prisoners halted
their strike because they reached certain understandings with the
Israeli authorities. None of us want a return to the hunger strike and
we would never wish for this. However, if they do not receive any
response to their demands for simple every day basic necessities and if
conditions in the prisons are not returned to what they were a year and
a half ago, then the situation will become very difficult and nobody
will be able to prevent the prisoners from resisting in order to improve
their living conditions.

Q: Prisoners say some of their demands have been met, while
the Israelis deny this. What is the score? What demands have been met,
and why are the Israelis denying this?

A: This is all part of the negotiations between the
prisoners and the prison authorities. We are here to give them support
but we were never part of the negotiations. To know exactly what went on
[in the negotiations] will take some time, and therefore it will be a
while before we know what demands were met and what are the issues still
pending. We have to wait before we judge anything and give it time.
Until now, we don't have any details. Anyway, an issue like this cannot
come to an end overnight--it needs time, so we must be patient and see
what their negotiations brought about. As far as we know, the
negotiations are still ongoing.

Q: How effective do you feel the strike was?

A: Strikes are one of the legal avenues for prisoners and
the strike is one form of revolutionary resistance. This means that
anyone who supports freedom in the world should stand by them and anyone
with a conscience should give them support because this is a very
civilized way of rebellion. Because strikes are legal, peaceful and
civilized, they have always given positive results.

Q: Both Palestinian officials and the Palestinian public
have in word or deed shown solidarity with the prisoners. How effective
do you feel the strike was in this regard?

A: Of course there was support from them because the
prisoners are their people--they are their sons, their brothers, their
sisters, their colleagues--who are fighting in their own way. So the
people no doubt will stand behind them. This is the least the people can
do for the prisoners.

So, one success of the strike is that it reactivated the Palestinian
street all over the homeland, and all the sectors participated to show
their support.

Q: Some prisoners would have been on hunger strike for over
two weeks. How is their health?

A: The prisoners who were on hunger strike for this period
were undergoing very difficult health conditions. However, now, four
days after the strike was called off, their health is gradually
returning to normal.

Q: In general, what impact do the prisoners and their
activities have on Palestinian society?

A: At present there are 7,500 Palestinian prisoners in
Israeli jails. Of these 450 are children and 1,700 are administrative
detainees. The remainder has been sentenced or is awaiting sentencing.
The prisoners represent the conscience of the people, and people's
support is what gives prisoners their strength and determination.

"Isr","Neut","Q: Some Palestinians talk of mounting a nonviolent
intifada. Do you believe Palestinian society is capable of this? 

Rothschild: I'm not sure I know what ""nonviolent intifada"" means. If
this means no shooting, no stone throwing, no violent acts at all, this
is one thing. If it means no shooting, but stones and Molotov cocktails
are allowed, this is a different issue. 

Q: Let's begin with the first case: no violent acts at all. /

Rothschild: I'm not sure they can. As I see Palestinian society at
the moment it is too divided and diverse. Part of what has happened in
the last four years happened because we disarmed their entire law and
order structure, and part happened because Yasser Arafat did not want
such a structure. In the absence of a law and order structure those who
took the lead are those who traditionally committed criminal acts, not
terrorist acts, and they have gained a lot of power, money and respect
in their regions and I'm not sure they're going to give them up. Are
they capable of launching a sort of nonviolent intifada? I doubt it. 

Q: And the second, more limited use of nonviolence. /

Rothschild: As far as we are concerned it makes no difference. A
stone can kill and so can a Molotov cocktail, just as shooting can. Of
course there's a difference in the way you react, but it doesn't matter
for the sake of this discussion. 

Q: How would the IDF react to genuine and comprehensive
non-violence? 

Rothschild: It depends how widespread the phenomenon is. If an entire
region is launching non-violent demonstrations I don't think the IDF
should interfere--up to the moment when it endangers Israeli life and
property. Then it will have to react in a non-lethal, non-violent way.
But up to that moment it shouldn't do anything. 

Q: The Bet Sahour tax strike during the first intifada was
seen by many as an attempt to invoke nonviolent means. This happened on
your ""watch"". 

Rothschild: Yes, that was in my time. The situation has changed
since. A tax strike at that time was a strike against us. Today a
Palestinian tax strike or even an education strike will be against
themselves. The moment the Palestinian Authority took responsibility
over all civilian spheres of life, this kind of nonviolent strike became
worth very little. 

[In its day] it also achieved very little, which is why it didn't
spread. The strike was counterproductive. At the end of the day people
need services from the responsible authority. They paid no taxes and got
no services. We didn't pay salaries to teachers and health services,
didn't deal with garbage and sewage, and in no time they understood that
that was not the way to deal with our rule. 

Q: Do you recall additional instances of Palestinian
nonviolent struggle initiatives? 

Rothschild: In 1988, Arafat initiated the peace march from all the
refugee camps in the south of Lebanon to Israel. The Lebanese stopped
them because they understood it would become hellish. Arafat wanted to
do the same from Jordan and from Egypt, but the authorities there
declared a military zone. I was head of IDF intelligence analysis at the
time and we dealt with this threat quite a bit. Our solution was that as
long as they do not endanger Israeli life and property we won't take
action. But we would have prevented them from coming. 

Q: Suppose, for example, that a large mass of Palestinians
from the West Bank tried to march to the Temple MountHaram al-Sharif in
Jerusalem. 

Rothschild: At Feisal Husseini's funeral a year or two ago we allowed
a large mass of Palestinians to enter Jerusalem. Since then we have used
tear gas and other non-lethal weapons to prevent this. New non-lethal
weapons may soon be introduced. The use of weapons is escalative. The
moment they endanger property or lives we'll open fire.
"
"Pal","Neut","The Palestinian nonviolent movement is as old as the Palestinian
liberation movement itself. As far back as the 1930s, Palestinians
engaged in nonviolent protests and demonstrations against the British
Mandate authorities. This form of protest peaked with the breakout of
the 1987 intifada. That uprising, which was for the most part nonviolent
in nature, brought immediate international recognition to the
Palestinian people, forced Israeli society to recognize Palestinians as
a ""people"" and to recognize their legitimate leadership, and finally led
to a peace process. The failure of that peace process, known as the Oslo
peace process was not due to the means that led to the negotiating
table, on the contrary; it was largely due to the lack of continued
mobilization and support by the Palestinian leadership of the popular
Palestinian nonviolent resistance movement. Nonviolent resistance should
have continued as a means to balance the imbalance at the negotiating
table, viewed by the Palestinian leadership as the only way of attaining
the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.

The failure of the peace process led to the breakout of the second
intifada in 2000. Again, Palestinians initially engaged in nonviolent
forms of resistance, but the Israeli military response to these protests
was more brutal and forceful than at any time before during the
occupation. This convinced some groups within the Palestinian community
that only the use of arms and suicide attacks to balance out the pain
being heaped upon Palestinians would be effective in making the
occupation as costly as possible to the Israeli public. This, however,
combined with the lack of a clear strategy and a clear vision to
mobilize the Palestinian population in nonviolent forms of resistance,
emboldened the Israeli government to take full advantage of the change
in the rules of engagement after September 11, 2001 and attempt to
de-legitimize the entire Palestinian liberation movement, linking its
goals with the means used to achieve them. The Palestinian armed
resistance, labeled as ""terrorism"" by Israel, was portrayed as the goal
of the Palestinian liberation movement rather than a means, justified or
otherwise.

The legitimacy of the goals of freedom and independence should not be
viewed through the lens of the ""means"" used to achieve these goals. The
struggle to end the occupation and establish an independent Palestinian
state does not gain or lose legitimacy if nonviolent means are preferred
over violent means and vice versa. Even with the changes in
international politics and a steadily growing voice within the
Palestinian community criticizing and condemning the armed resistance,
particularly those actions that target Israeli civilians, the legitimacy
of the Palestinian struggle is embedded in international law,
international conventions on human rights and numerous United Nations
resolutions, up until and including the most recent decision by the
International Court of Justice regarding the separation wall.

A more important question deals with the issue of efficacy. Are the
means used effective in achieving the legitimate aspirations of the
Palestinian people?

When discussing armed resistance, Palestinians must recognize both the
internal and international implications of continuing the armed
resistance. The gross imbalance of power, the unrestrained and brutal
actions of the Israeli military, and the change in the direction of
world politics have left Palestinians defenseless and isolated in the
face of daily aggressions. The armed resistance, even armed defense, has
been effective only in creating excuses for greater Israeli aggression.

But to say that one is ineffective is not to show that the other isn't.
When it comes to nonviolent resistance, the question most people ask is
how do you nonviolently resist your prison guard when you are in prison?
How do you resist the occupation when you are surrounded by walls and
fences? Examples of nonviolent resistance from across the world
highlight one important factor: direct confrontation and contact with
the enemy is vital to expose that enemy's brutality and unjust policies.
In Palestine today, however, Palestinians are trapped in a prison. Going
on hunger strike means absolutely nothing, while protesting and marching
means walking around in circles. So what nonviolent tactics can be used
effectively to expose the occupation and affect its end?

The answer is threefold. First, a strong leadership committed to the
principles of nonviolent resistance and community building must be
established. The initial focus will be on the need to unify Palestinian
communities and reestablish trust between the leadership and the people.
This should be followed by the development of a long-term internal
strategy to build a nonviolent resistance movement on a massive scale.

Secondly, the Palestinian population inside and outside of Palestine
must be mobilized in mass campaigns beginning with a boycott of Israeli
products campaign and moving on to more dangerous protests at check
points, on settler roads, and near international border crossings.

Finally and simultaneously, the Arab, Muslim, international streets as
well as the Israeli peace camp must also be mobilized to support this
nonviolent Palestinian movement. Sustained and significant popular
protests against Israel will eventually pressure the Israeli government
to take the necessary steps towards peace.

Nonviolent resistance is never easy. It takes tremendous dedication,
discipline and sacrifice. And while no means are guaranteed effective,
the nonviolent approach attempts to neutralize the power of the enemy
and to target the collective consciousness of the populace rather than
empowering enemy extremists by handing them the blind and unconditional
support of a people fearful of annihilation.

The international community has declared that the death of the late
President Yasser Arafat is an opportunity to revive the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process. The Palestinian community needs to
see the death of their president as an opportunity to reinforce the
commitment to the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people and
to achieve these aspirations by engaging in effective nonviolent means
of resistance and community building.
"
"Isr","Neut","The Israeli-Palestinian peace process was always marred with
contradictions: mutual dependence with mutual rejection; a desire for
separation with an inertia of occupation; necessary compromise with
traditional dogmas. Today's most blatant paradox is that both Israeli
and Palestinian public opinion, fatigued by conflict, understanding that
nothing will be resolved by force, now accept far-reaching compromises
that were unimaginable when the Oslo process began.

Most Israelis would now accept a Palestinian state more or less within
the 1967 boundaries, even if that includes some compromise over
Jerusalem and a major withdrawal of settlements, if they knew that the
other side would finally end the conflict and if this would guarantee an
end to terror and violence. Most Palestinians would espouse peaceful
coexistence with Israel and eradicate terrorist organizations such as
the Hamas and the Jihad, if they thought Israel was honestly ready to
grant the Palestinians independence and end the occupation.

What keeps the conflict alive and dangerous are therefore not
fundamental positions of mainstream society, but an inherent suspicion
about the real intentions of the leadership of the other side.
Palestinians believe that peace for Israel is another means for the
continuation of occupation. For most Israelis, Palestinian peace means
only the continuation of conflict and the implementation of the right of
return.

Both sides have therefore finally come to the right conclusion about
their basic positions, yet are haunted by misguided suspicions about the
other side. This is exactly the point where the leadership needs to
create a bridge of trust. This is exactly the juncture where both
Palestinian leader Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Sharon are missing
a tremendous, historic opportunity. Rather than demonizing the other
leader, they should begin a dialogue to create the needed trust, as
nothing will be solved by conflict and we will both deteriorate into a
situation of futile bloodshed.

Today there is a new opportunity. The Peres-Abu Ala understandings
create the necessary framework for a political process which is based on
the incremental eradication of terrorism and the establishment of a
Palestinian state, with ongoing negotiations on the permanent status
issues within a given time framework, supported by the international
community. If Sharon and Arafat (as well as the American interlocutors)
do not use these understandings as a platform to recreate dialogue
instead of solutions by force, they will neither reflect the needs of
their respective people, nor their fundamental desires.

This is how the people, as well as history, will ultimately judge them.
If both or either of them are guided by the easy track of populism and
demagoguery, a possible and necessary historical peace will be missed,
Israel will be defeated by its own occupation of Palestinian territory
and Palestine will be defeated by its own tolerance of fundamentalist
violence.

The ""Peres-Abu Ala test"" is related not only to how we will live
together side by side, but also to what our identities will be. The two
leaders and our American friends will have to answer these questions,
based on the existing concrete proposal, over the next few weeks, if not
days.
"
"Pal","Neut","Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak succeeded as no one before him
(not even the Israeli right wing) in destroying the infrastructure of
the peace process and pushing Israel to political extremism.
Ingenuously, he was able to destroy the peace camp inside Israel and
render it a camp of surrender, only defending itself instead of
defending the future of Israel. And then came Ariel Sharon, who reaped
what Barak had sown, expending neither sweat nor toil.

So as to avoid delving further into political events in order to
diagnose Israeli political shortcomings, I want to ask: Is it possible
under this ruling Israeli government to attain a historic reconciliation
based on a political solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict that
includes a Palestinian state within the borders of June 1967 with Arab
Jerusalem as its capital and a just solution to the Palestinian refugee
problem?

Very simply, the answer is an adamant ""no."" I insist that we have not
invented this ""no"" just because we do not like Sharon and his racist
cronies. It is true that I loathe this gang, but love and hate are
irrelevant in this situation.

Instead, my conclusion is based on recognizing and analyzing Sharon's
vision, politics and ideology. It is also based on the idea that real
peace, which needs sustenance to survive, must have specific
foundations. These foundations are an international consensus with
legitimacy in international law and which the political leadership of
the Palestinian people agreed to many years ago.

At this point, it cannot hurt to reaffirm those foundations as follows:

Principle One: Complete cessation of the Israeli occupation on all land
occupied in 1967 that falls within the June 4 borders, including Arab
Jerusalem.

Principle Two: The establishment of a Palestinian state on this land
side by side with Israel and not at its expense. The Palestinian state
must be real and on the ground, with full sovereignty and respect for
its agreements and its neighboring countries.

Principle Three: A just solution to the Palestinian refugee problem,
according to United Nations Resolution 194. This principle has been
turned into a kind of ""scarecrow"" by some Israelis in order to terrorize
and frighten Israel from a solution. For us, it is not in any way a trap
through which to swallow up Israel. Rather, it is a door through which
we must pass in order to bring finality to an issue that is the crux of
the cause.

I do not think that any of the negotiations that have taken place have
given the Israeli negotiators the idea that we want to swallow up
Israel. We are not so naive or foolish as to play a child's game of hide
and seek.

Principle Four: This is a complex principle in that it dictates a full
halt to the mentality of domination in all its forms; that historic
reconciliation is a historic event and not a historic slogan; and that
all segments of the Zionist movement, in particular the state of Israel,
realize that military power will not succeed in breaking the will of the
Palestinian people no matter how it is fortified by American might. The
world has tired of the occupation and will not accept the lies of the
occupiers forever.

Principle Five: Israel must realize that the Palestinian people are in
dire need of peace (more so than any other people in the world) and that
their decision in this regard was a strategic decision and not one
forced upon them. Even if there is at times political or even military
confrontation against the occupation, we continue to recognize--at a
very high price, I might add--that peace and coexistence in the
two-state framework on the land of historic Palestine is the final
solution. It is not some kind of stage, but a historic ending.

Will Israel accept this solution? That is what must be proven now, since
Israel has not yet declared the abandonment of its overall aspirations
towards domination. It certainly has not declared the abandonment of its
occupation of the Palestinian people and their land. Israel remains a
state that has not yet defined what it wants from the region in which it
lives.

Therefore, is Sharon and his government or even the next government
capable of formulating a ""strategic political vision"" for a real peace?
Is Israel, as a society, prepared for this vision? The answer is clearly
""no.""

Current Israeli leaders are presenting us with their agenda. In short,
they are telling us: ""The Palestinian people have no hope of seeing an
end to the occupation of their land taken in 1967. There is no way that
you will see Arab Jerusalem as part of your national soil. You will not
see, during our government or the next, the dismantling of Israeli
settlements on your land. In addition to all this, you can forget
forever any just solution to the refugee problem."" These are the
components of the ""Israeli vision"" for a political solution.

In tandem with this vision, the current Sharon-led government is
demonstrating its own political inventions by destroying the national
integrity of the Palestinian people and the cohesive Palestinian
identity. If we reject these measures, we are accused of being
""terrorists"" and sometimes ""anti-Semites."" The Zionist jargon of this
government says, ""You must accept what I want.""

If we do not accept the occupation, they say that we want to destroy
Israel. If we do not accept the annexation of Jerusalem in its entirety,
it means that we are denying their religious beliefs. If we do not
accept their settlements inside our occupied land, they consider this a
denial of their history. And if we do not accept their terror and
killing of our people, then we are denying them the right to ""defend""
themselves.

This is the broken record. Even so, we have not lost our faith in peace.
We will fight in every way alongside each Israeli who wishes to live on
the principles of real peace. We must work towards peace, despite that
we cannot envision its birth under the likes of the current Israeli
leadership.

But how long will this take? It requires action and wisdom. Neither we
nor they have any other choice. We demand a political solution, not its
mirage. The starting point is to rehabilitate peace and its
infrastructure.
"
"Isr","Neut","The near euphoric sensation of the past weeks embodies both dangers and
opportunities. Euphoria is liable to generate too high a threshold of
expectations that will not pass the reality test. On the other hand,
this new sensation could restore the hope that has been so absent in the
last four years and create a positive psycho-political atmosphere among
the relevant publics. And that atmosphere, in turn, will ensure greater
survivability for the process and a readiness on the part of the leaders
to take more chances than in the past.

Both sides' commitment to embark on a new political path can generate
rapid changes and processes on the ground that will accelerate the peace
process and assist in returning it to the path it followed prior to the
intifada. That is the wish of most of the publics on both sides of the
green line. The withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and northern Samaria, an
end to terrorism and violence, the reform and democratization process in
the Palestinian Authority, and confidence-building measures by Israel
are all good instruments for advancing the peace process. But the
question is, what will happen to the process the day after this
preliminary arsenal is spent.

The danger confronting us is that the peace process will proceed up to
the completion of the withdrawal planned in the context of
disengagement, and there it will stop. The surprising disengagement plan
was born with the objective of serving a conservative goal: to prevent
or at least delay the political process designed to lead to a permanent
settlement.

In an optimal situation, logic would dictate that immediately after
stabilizing the security situation and following the withdrawal from
Gaza and northern Samaria, we enter intensive negotiations over
permanent status on the basis of the Geneva Accord. In theory there is
no need to beat around the bush. Following the historic precedent of
returning to the 1967 borders in the Gaza Strip and removing all the
settlements in those areas the IDF leaves, it is only natural to
continue the process in the West Bank. The Israeli and Palestinian
publics know almost precisely what final status will look like; hence,
logically, we should implement it.

But political realities are not necessarily logical. The man heading
Israel's government today is not a leader capable of making the leap to
a real and fair permanent settlement, but rather one who has not yet
internalized the fact that there is no other option. Yet the historical
imperative appears to be stronger than the leader and his party.

Accordingly, in order to generate and strengthen the right dynamic that
will move the process and oblige the Israeli side to enter serious
negotiations on permanent status as early as possible, we have to
reexamine the existing tools in our long-term arsenal. Regrettable as
this may sound, the only relevant tool to be found is the Quartet's
roadmap. Hence we must return to implementation of this plan, with the
goal of exploiting it as a means of moving us in an agreed and organized
manner out of the twilight and into a period of renewed peace negotiations.

Paradoxically, we are talking here of a limited plan, a fairly sloppy
patchwork document that was outdated the moment it was published, and
even then would not have stood the test of reality. But it is the only
document that is agreed, at least at the level of principle, by both
sides. Further, this is the program to which the American president is
committed, and it is he who must become involved in pushing the Israeli
side to join the ""permanent status tango"".

The day after withdrawal from Gaza, progress is the name of the game.
The Palestinians cannot allow themselves to march in place, just as they
cannot enter negotiations over an interim agreement without knowing
precisely how final status will look. An updated version of the roadmap
in which, for example, phase II--which is liable to be a deathtrap for a
real process--is replaced by deep withdrawals in the West Bank along the
lines of the Oslo ""further redeployments"" and the parameters of phase
III are spelled out in greater detail, could constitute a possible
solution in the absence of an alternative mechanism.

The roadmap is today the only game in town. In the current effort to
restart the process even a mediocre and incomplete plan is a legitimate
tool for relaunching the long road to peace.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: Is it too early to start talking about implementing the
roadmap?

A: I think it would be a big mistake if the Palestinians have
not already started the discussion with the Israelis on Israeli
implementation of their part of the roadmap. The Palestinians have
already started implementing their own commitments, and it would be
unthinkable for the Palestinians to be doing so without the Israelis
doing so as well. I believe the primary objective of the Sharm Al Sheikh
meeting should be to ensure that the Israelis as well as the
Palestinians are implementing those commitments to which they have
already agreed.

Q: Is it practical at this stage? Abbas seems to be
following a tactic of talking the factions into a ceasefire rather than
disarming them, as phase I calls for?

A: The roadmap certainly does not say that the only way of
establishing a cessation of violence is through Palestinian violence
against the factions. It leaves open the door for the Palestinians to
find ways to ensure a cessation of violence. The part that you are
referring to and which might be difficult for Abbas is the part that
deals with the collection of arms, but for that to start, the roadmap
also states that, with the help of the US in particular, the Palestinian
security forces will be restructured and rebuilt. Only once they are
restructured and rebuilt would those forces begin to collect
weapons--but only begin to them. I believe that from now until the end
of the first phase of the roadmap, which could be somewhere around the
parliamentary elections in July, the outcome of those elections will
clearly indicate that the newly established government has the
legitimacy to collect arms. The Palestinians therefore, by the end of
the first phase of the roadmap, will be in fulfillment of their
commitments.

Q: You mentioned the US. In her just-completed visit, US
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice didn't mention the roadmap once. Is
the US still interested in the roadmap?

A: I think the US at the rhetorical level is clearly committed
to the roadmap. In reality, however, neither the US nor Israel has
indicated that it is considering the activation of the roadmap in an
operational fashion so that it can become binding and so that the
actions of the two sides today would be measured by their commitment to
the roadmap. The Americans have difficulty in pressing Sharon on
settlements, for example, whether on freezing settlement construction
all over the occupied territories, including expansion for ""natural
growth"", or on the removal of outposts, which is also required by the
roadmap. The US, especially since the Israelis presented their
disengagement plan, has given priority to that plan and has to a large
extent ignored Israeli commitments with regards to the settlements.
There are other important Israeli commitments under the roadmap in
addition to the settlements, but certainly, for the Palestinians, the
settlement issue is one of the most urgent issues. If Israel does not
freeze settlement construction, efforts by the Palestinians to improve
the security situation are going to be seen by the Palestinian public as
an attempt to preserve the status quo, even as the Israelis continue to
change the status quo daily.

Q: You mentioned the unilateral disengagement plan. How
does that alter the picture?

A: The Israeli disengagement plan can be considered as part of
the implementation of the second phase of the roadmap. This
disengagement is in any case not going to start for another six months
or so. If we say the roadmap has already started, in six months the
first phase of the roadmap will be over, and it will be time for Israel
to begin, as phase II states, taking further action on settlements and
allowing the establishment of a Palestinian entity with provisional
borders. That entity must have contiguous territory. Therefore, in
implementing phase II, Israel not only needs to pull out of Gaza, but
needs to carry out significant settlement evacuation in the West Bank as
well.

Q: With the current Israeli government, isn't there a fear
that it would prefer to see a phase II Palestinian state and nothing else?

A: I think the Palestinians will make a decision on the state
with provisional borders based on what they see between now and when
that time comes. It may be that the Palestinian Authority does not wish
to change its current status to become such a state. What is important
is that the Israelis evacuate the settlements, and that they remove the
impediments to territorial contiguity. What the Palestinians wish to do
with that is optional. The roadmap clearly states that the Palestinians
have the option to declare a state with provisional borders. But the
Palestinians may decide that they would rather keep the current
political and legal status of the PA. This does not mean the Israelis
would not have to implement their own commitments. These are not
optional. The only optional part is whether the Palestinians should
declare a state with provisional borders.

Q: If the US is not serious in pressuring Israel, how
optimistic are you that we will witness a return to the roadmap?

A: I think it is very clear that we now have an opportunity in
the post-Arafat period in which the Palestinians are demonstrating a
commitment to the implementation of the roadmap and in fact are already
implementing it in terms of political reform, in terms of the
unification of the security services and in terms of ending violence.
Ignoring all of this could lead to a situation of great disappointment
on the Palestinian side, and this could have very serious consequences
for the ability of the president to continue to maintain the existing
ceasefire. This ceasefire is fragile, and will remain so unless it is
part of a larger political process, which starts with the implementation
of the roadmap and even goes further--we should be looking as quickly as
possible at permanent status issues if we start implementing the
roadmap. If Washington does not press Israel to go along with what the
US has itself proposed, I think the reaction on the Palestinian side is
going to be very negative.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: What is your trusteeship plan for the conflict?

A: The Meretz platform uses the term ""international trusteeship.""
The concept is not that far from the one proposed in the roadmap
                                               , i.e., supervision,
control, judging performance and involvement of the Quartet, but at a
different scope.

The plan has two dimensions, civil and security. We believe the civil
dimension is more important. Everything has been destroyed in the
territories, 60 percent are in need of food aid, the infrastructure is
gone, and we need massive rehabilitation if there is to be any chance
for improving the security situation. Israel cannot and will not do the
rehabilitation. The Palestinians may want to, but they cannot. Therefore
the international community must be present in order to carry out the
reconstruction.

Q: What are the dimensions of the force you anticipate?

A: We're talking about a force several thousand civilians and
soldiers strong, with the emphasis on the civilians. We've been asked if
we believe that someone will endanger their people, say, in Ramallah.
Well, if they send forces to Baghdad, Ramallah is certainly less dangerous.

Q: Will the force be based on prior agreement?

A: I don't believe in a process of agreeing, because there is a
problem of violations and it's impossible to judge who's at fault. So we
do not have to do this based on agreements whose advantages are doubtful.

Q: From an Israeli standpoint, aren't you concerned about
complications like those Israel feels it had with the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)? There will be terrorist attacks, the
Israel Defense Forces will respond, the international force will blame
Israel, there will be clashes between Israel and the force, etc...

A: I don't have a definitive answer. The assumption is that over
time there will be fewer attacks, Israel behind the fence will be better
protected, the Palestinian Authority will be more motivated, and there
will be more supervision. In any case Israel will have to continue
responding in a pinpoint manner according to need. Apropos, that danger
is an argument for the necessity of prior agreement between us and the
international military trusteeship.

Q: Will the trusteeship be territorial or virtual? With or
without Israeli withdrawal? Former US Ambassador Martin Indyk, for
example, has proposed integrating deployment of the trusteeship force
with Israeli unilateral withdrawal.

A: De facto, the trusteeship will replace the PA [Palestinian
Authority], with its diminished capacity, and the occupation.
Officially, the trusteeship will work with the PA. As a consequence,
Israel will certainly return in the first stage to the September 28,
2000 lines, and in the second stage to the '67 lines. Indyk's proposal
is more or less the same.

Q: Let's turn to other types of international forces. How
do you see the idea embodied in the roadmap, for a supervisory or
control force?

A: That is an open plan, which explains its advantages and its
drawbacks. I support giving the force the authority to judge the degree
to which the two sides fulfill their obligations. I'm for a four-sided
force--not only American, but with American leadership. In general,
these [members of the Quartet] are responsible actors who are not
automatically anti-Israeli. I'm not paranoid about this.

Q: And a separation force as part of a final status agreement?

A: This is an important contribution. The force would patrol the
borders between us, and would put itself at the disposal of the
bilateral supervisory and control mechanisms.

Q: Finally, does the difficult experience of the past two
years, preceded by the collapse of the peace process, point to a greater
or a reduced necessity for international involvement?

A: Greater. Without international intervention and pressure I
don't believe there will be progress.
"
"Pal","Neut","There is no question that Palestinians and Israel desperately need a
meaningful third party intervention strong enough to make visible
changes on the ground. The two-state solution is continuously being
threatened by Israel's incessant settlement construction and so-called
""security fence"" designed to imprison the entire Palestinian population.
At the same time, violence aimed at Israelis undoubtedly continues to
threaten Palestinian realization of freedom and independence. While
putting an end to violence against Israeli civilians and securing
Palestinian freedom and independence are two different goals, they are
so interconnected that the vehicle needed to achieve them is one. Over
the last two years, many have called for an ""observer mission"" or
""protection force,"" while others have suggested establishing a
""protectorate"" or ""trusteeship"", at times using the terms
interchangeably without fully understanding their implications.

Observers can only do one thing: observe. They do not have the
capability to enforce political agreements. Their only task is to report
on violations. The Temporary International Presence in Hebron is the
perfect example, but clearly not the perfect model. Following the
massacre of 29 Palestinians in Hebron, TIPH placed international
observers in specified locations in Hebron to monitor events and report
back to their member states on incidents that violate the provisions of
Palestinian-Israelis agreements. Confidential reports are sent to
contributing states--far from the scene--and ultimately enter a black
hole, producing nothing. Given the intensity of this conflict and the
corresponding lack of trust, monitors will only preserve the status quo
rather than change it.

On the other hand, deployment of armed forces as part of ""trusteeship""
or ""protectorate"", as some have proposed, is a non-starter. These models
assume the total collapse of all Palestinian institutions, including the
Palestine Liberation Organization. While the mandate may attempt to
establish a transitional government and seek to disarm Palestinian armed
activists, intervention will not be supported by the masses and many may
even resist it. As such, detractors envision Somalia all over again,
whereby the perceptions and attitudes of those deployed do not
necessarily reflect the concerns of the local population. The
consequences were disastrous then and, if applied here, will be equally
disastrous.

If the mandate for intervention is not precise or fails to address the
root causes and concerns of both sides, any type of deployment--military
or otherwise--will be rendered useless and counterproductive. As such,
intervention in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires
three important elements: a political initiative backed and supported by
continuous international political capital, political will at the local
level and a robust monitoring mechanism capable of verifying
implementation and resolving disputes in an expeditious manner. At
present, it is clear that the first element has been secured, or at
least for the time being. With the roadmap's
                                                 imminent publication,
it is hoped that the presence of a strong monitoring mechanism to ensure
effective implementation will encourage and foster political will at the
local level.

We have learned that the parties' most persistent quarrels have centered
on the failure to abide by past agreements. Indeed, the absence of an
international monitoring and implementation mechanism during the Oslo
period clearly resulted in disagreements. Such disputes could have been
circumvented if an effective implementation and monitoring mechanism had
been in place. It has become abundantly clear that both parties will
need the engagement of the international community in order to
effectively address their concerns. Without a strong enforcement
mechanism, the roadmap will soon be rendered irrelevant and the power
imbalance that exists will be perpetuated. It is clear that
international intervention must ultimately have two main goals: the
first is to ensure that Israel has the security it requires and, second,
to establish a viable, prosperous Palestinian state in the West Bank and
Gaza, including East Jerusalem, living in peace side by side with Israel.

Palestinians and Israelis alike are particularly worried that if this
process stalls or if a minor dispute turns into a major dispute it will
result in a terminal blow to the roadmap itself, or any future attempt
at resolving the conflict. Palestinians have now gone far in
implementing nearly all of the provisions of ""phase 1"" of the roadmap,
even before the document's final issuance. The international community
must exert maximum political capital to compel and encourage Israel to
begin implementing its obligations, as well.

The monitoring mechanism that is put in place must be detailed and clear
in order to facilitate implementation. Vagueness will only delay it, and
if that delay becomes extensive, the roadmap will become irrelevant.
Even though the Government of Israel may not currently have the
political will to freeze settlement construction, a monitoring mechanism
should ensure that the roadmap moves forward. In the end, the rewards of
a robust monitoring and enforcement mechanism will hopefully break the
cycle of failure and ensure that peace between the Palestinians and
Israel is achieved and maintained.
"
"Isr","Neut","Egypt's involvement in the search for a way out of the
Israeli-Palestinian crisis is growing. Egyptian interest in the
disengagement plan initiated by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has
not faltered despite the bitter political struggle over the plan within
the Israeli government. Nor did it diminish even when Palestinian
spokespersons objected to the pressures exercised by their Egyptian ally
on the Palestinian leadership and to Egypt's undisguised interference in
the internal affairs of the Palestinian Authority.

The angry political discussion taking place in Israel between the pro
and anti-disengagement camps is seen by Cairo as an internal Israeli
affair. Of course, Egypt's involvement is not intended to aid the
government of Israel, and certainly not its head. Sharon was and is
anathema to most of the Egyptian public and its leaders.

Rather, Egypt's growing involvement is a direct consequence of the
assessment of the government of President Husni Mubarak concerning the
grave Middle East situation generated by both the turmoil in Iraq and
the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation. The two crises feed upon one
another, and together nourish regional instability. The
Israeli-Palestinian crisis has become brutal, and its prolongation
increasingly threatens the vital national interests of additional Arab
states--first and foremost Egypt and Jordan, which border on the
conflict. Daily reports of heavy Palestinian casualties have a
cumulative effect on Egyptian public opinion. Anger directed at Israel,
as well as at United States activities in Iraq, frequently also takes
the form of sharp criticism of the neglect exercised by the Egyptian
authorities. This emanates today not only from the traditional
opposition, but from spokespersons identified with the Egyptian public
mainstream.

Under a heavy screen of diplomatic niceties, the Egyptian leadership
believes that the Bush administration's Middle East policies are at
fault, and may even be exacerbating the situation. But the complex
nature of the ties between the two countries dictates caution on the
part of the Mubarak government, in order to avoid a crisis in its
relationship with Washington. Cairo well appreciates that this
relationship is also being tested. Hence its involvement in advancing an
Israeli-Palestinian settlement is part and parcel of Egypt's overall
policy toward the only superpower.

Egypt's role at this stage is also facilitated by the unique approach it
has taken to the Palestinian Authority since the crisis began in the
fall of 2000. For years Egypt consistently and successfully cultivated
its status as patron of the PA and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. It
took upon itself a variety of tasks at various stages of
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Not everyone was happy with the
Egyptian performance. Sharp criticism, rarely justified, emanated from
both Israel and the US, alleging that Egypt avoided playing a
significant role in ending the conflict, or even thwarted the process.
(The critics ignored the fact that neither Israel nor the US offered the
Mubarak government a role that would correspond with Egypt's political
agenda.) Jerusalem and Washington argued that Egypt's decision not to
exercise its full influence on the Palestinian leadership was one of the
causes of the failure of final status negotiations. Egypt rebuffed these
accusations, and maintained a constant dialogue with Arafat and his
advisers, even as Israel and the US claimed that the Palestinian leader
was no longer relevant and constituted an obstacle to peace.

True, on a number of issues Egypt took issue with the Palestinian
leadership. Mubarak and his emissaries have called for changes in the
PA, including a decentralization of the authority held by President
Arafat. But the two actors remain in agreement regarding the strategic
objective of a two-state solution along the June 4, 1967 borders. The
Egyptian leadership played the ""Arafat card"" deftly; hence it now has
the opportunity to play an instrumental role in the Israeli-Palestinian
crisis.

The decision to increase its involvement in the conflict undoubtedly
strengthens the standing of the Mubarak regime as a force for moderation
and stability in the otherwise threateningly unstable Middle East. The
cultivation of this image, along with the commitment to peace with
Israel, remains a constant guarantee for the ongoing flow of intensive
and vital external aid to Egypt. But this was not an easy decision for
the authorities in Cairo. There is considerable concern lest Egyptian
forces in Gaza be drawn into the eye of the storm and sustain
casualties. On the other hand, public opinion is liable to regard a
limited Egyptian force in the Gaza Strip as a vanguard; if the violence
there continues, this could strengthen the voices of those who have
already demanded that a more significant force be dispatched to protect
the Palestinians--thereby possibly precipitating the kind of
unprecedented crisis with Israel that Egypt has successfully avoided
over the years.

In the complex reality of today's Middle East, any new initiative can be
influenced by an infinite number of factors. Will Sharon's disengagement
plan be carried out in the end? Will it indeed generate a renewal of the
political process, or, God forbid, escalate the conflict? Will the
leaders of the two belligerent sides, and particularly Arafat,
contribute to stabilizing the situation? Only the answers to these and
additional questions will tell us the nature of the local and regional
ramifications of the unprecedented Egyptian involvement in seeking a
solution.
"
"Pal","Neut","Despite its breaking the Arab consensus to sign the first peace treaty
with Israel approximately 25 years ago, Egypt has gained the deep
confidence of the Palestinian leadership. Consequently, Egypt has
assumed a central role in the search for a settlement of the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The Palestinians' deep-rooted belief that
their Egyptian partner has no hidden interests in Palestine has
consolidated their trust in Egypt. Furthermore, Egyptian support for the
Palestinian cause is firm and springs from profound and genuine
relationships that transcend considerations of present unstable
interests. In contrast, even though Egypt was the first Arab country to
sign a peace treaty with Israel, successive Israeli governments have
complained about the coldness of the peace with Egypt and the Egyptian
bias towards the Palestinians and Palestinian cause.

Despite having always been suspicious of the traditional Egyptian role
regarding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon now wants to rely on Egypt, particularly with respect to security
aspects, to implement his unilateral plan for gradual withdrawal from
the Gaza Strip. In this respect, it appears that Egypt is responsive to
the Israeli proposal, leading us to the main problems raised within this
context: What are the motives behind Sharon's shift in position to rely
on Egypt to implement his plan? Why would Egypt respond to the Israeli
demand? Does such a response express a change in the traditional
Egyptian approach toward the Palestinian cause and the resolution of the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict?

Five motives behind Sharon's pursuit for a central Egyptian security
role in the Gaza Strip can be recalled. First, Sharon became aware that
the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, in order to be acceptable on
Palestinian, regional, and international levels, must ultimately be
completed and accompanied by serious and significant measures taken by
Israel in the West Bank. Furthermore, in order to gain credibility,
Israel must relinquish its control over the borders separating the Gaza
Strip from Egypt. Such a move would imply a kind of Palestinian
sovereignty in the Gaza Strip that could suggest that a foundation
towards establishing a Palestinian state exists.

Second, Sharon is expressing the stance of a broad Israeli majority that
no longer trusts transferring the responsibility of security within the
Palestinian territories to the Palestinian Authority. Within this
context, Israel is obliged to rely on a third party that it deems more
reliable, thus providing an opening for Egypt as a dependable substitute.

Third, according to Sharon, reliance on Egypt with respect to the
security of the Gaza Strip increases the confidence of all the Israeli
politicians who are hesitant to support his plan. Indeed, Egypt is a
country that has abided by its commitment to treaties and agreements.
Broad Israeli opposition to Sharon's plan necessitates his using all
means to ease the public's mind and facilitate the process.

Fourth, it would be favorable for Sharon to have Egyptian involvement in
his plan due to the confidence Egypt inspires in the Palestinian
leadership. As such, Egypt will be able to exert ""positive"" pressure on
the Palestinians to accept and implement the plan. Finally, Egypt's
involvement in assuming the security role in the Gaza Strip will serve
as a precedent and a reference for a possible future Jordanian security
role in the West Bank. Attaining advance security guarantees is
necessary for Sharon and Israel in order to be able to proclaim a
Palestinian state, which will be required to settle the
Palestinian/Arab-Israel conflict.

For its part, Egypt appears inclined to participate in the discussions
and implementation of Sharon's plan due to four principle factors.
First, Egypt is dissatisfied with the deterioration of the Palestinian
leadership and inconsistencies within the Palestinian agenda. According
to Egypt, these issues are a major threat to the Palestinian cause. If
the situation persists, any hope of realizing Palestinian rights will be
eliminated. Therefore, it is Egypt's obligation to contribute to getting
the Palestinian house in order as soon as possible in order to prevent
the current breakdown from reaching a climax.

Second, Egypt recognizes that Sharon's plan is Israel's last word
following the collapse of the roadmap
                                                , Beirut peace
initiative and Arab peace efforts. Egypt believes that it must play a
role due to the abnormal circumstances of Palestinians today. As long as
there is no alternative to Sharon's plan, Egypt appears convinced that
the plan will serve as a preliminary bridge obliging Israel toward
relinquishing the majority of the West Bank, which is necessary for a
comprehensive settlement.

Third, Egypt is concerned that, if Israel withdraws from Gaza, the Strip
could evolve into a hub of tension that would negatively influence
Egypt's steady relationship with Israel and the United States. In order
to safeguard its relationships, Egypt is willing to play a central role
in maintaining security in the Gaza Strip, particularly with respect to
control over the Palestinian-Egyptian border. Taking the aforementioned
factors into account eliminates justifications regarding border control
on behalf of the Israelis. Egypt believes that its central security role
will result in the complete termination of the Israeli occupation of the
Gaza Strip.

Finally, it is important to remember that Egypt has recently been under
tremendous American and international pressure and has been a direct
target of the US ""Greater Middle East Project."" Therefore, Egypt is
compelled to perform well with respect to pursuit of a
Palestinian-Israeli settlement, even though a comprehensive agreement is
not yet on the horizon.

Has the Egyptian role changed? Egypt is attempting to maneuver in order
to firmly sustain its principles regarding the Palestinian cause.
However, it is clear that Egypt and other Arab countries are
increasingly constricted in terms of the space they are afforded to
uphold their convictions. This situation has led to imposition of the
Israeli agenda, which is not conducive to a comprehensive, mutually
acceptable political settlement.
"
"Isr","Neut","The Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci once made the distinction between
what he called ""critical"" and ""organic"" intellectuals. Critical
intellectuals are typical of developed civil societies, in which
intellectuals view themselves as critics of power and as generally being
non-conformists; organic intellectuals are more prevalent in societies
in which individual moral responsibility is not highly developed, and
intellectuals see themselves in the role of spokesmen for a collective
identity. The latter frequently appear in societies still in the throes
of nationalism.

This distinction may be helpful in assessing the role of Israeli and
Palestinian intellectuals in their respective societies: it may also
explain why so many attempts at ""dialogue"" between intellectuals from
both societies have frequently been disappointing.

Most Israeli intellectuals--writers, academics, artists--view themselves
as the moral critics of their own society, standing in the prophetic
tradition of ""speaking truth to power""--to the power of their own
society. Hence the Israeli press--and Israeli literature--are full of
intellectuals and writers viewing their own society--its politics, its
government, its dominant myths and narratives--through critical lenses:
Amos Oz, A.B. Yehoshua and David Grossman are just three of the more
prominent writers who represent this critical vein in the Israeli
intellectual discourse. Most of them view themselves as good Israeli
patriots in a generalized sense, but they do not shy away from
criticizing--in newspaper articles, books and media interviews at home
and abroad--Israeli policies or some of the dominant Israeli myths.
There are obviously exceptions, but this critical role is true of most
Israeli intellectuals. Just read /Ha'aretz/.

Most Palestinian--and Arab--intellectuals view their role differently:
not as a vehicle for criticism of their society and its dominant values,
narratives and myths, but on the contrary: as the true bearers of
Palestinian (or Arab) nationalism. It is for this reason, for example,
that the most radical criticism in Egypt or Jordan of the peace treaties
with Israel has come from intellectual circles. For them, any
accommodation with Israel, let alone Zionism, is a breach of faith, if
not outright treason. These intellectuals may be Nasserists, former
communists or Islamic radicals; but they are indubitably intellectuals.
Few are the intellectuals in the Palestinian or Arab community in
general who dare to speak truth to power, or question the basic
narratives of Arabism: what has happened in the last years to perhaps
the one truly critical Egyptian intellectual, Sa'ad Eddin Ibrahim, or
earlier to Sadiq Jalal al-Azm in Syria, just shows how rare are the
cases of such nonconformist intellectuals in the Arab world.

This of course has far-reaching consequences for the general weakness of
civil society and democracy in the Arab world.

It is this discrepancy between the self-images of Israeli and
Palestinian intellectuals which makes the encounter between the two
groups so futile. In the dozens and hundreds of recent
Israeli-Palestinian dialogues, a familiar pattern emerges: the Israeli
intellectuals usually appear, in various degrees, critical of their own
government's policies, occasionally also of some basic tenets of
Zionism; the Palestinian intellectuals, on the other hand, repeat the
Palestinian narrative, criticize Israel--its policies, sometimes its
very existence. Hardly ever does one hear a Palestinian intellectual
question Palestinian policies, let alone the Palestinian master
narrative. If there is criticism of the Palestinian Authority, it is
that it is too accommodating to Israel, or that it is corrupt--the
latter being a merely generalized accusation. Israeli universities hold
dozens of conferences, in many cases with Palestinian participants, in
which various degrees of criticism of Israel are voiced. Hardly anything
similar can be seen in Palestinian or Arab universities.

It is because of this symmetry that so many Israeli-Palestinian
dialogues became so one-sided--with /both/ sides criticizing Israel. It
is for this reason that some Israelis have found these dialogues a sham
and an exercise in futility.

It is difficult to accept the claim that as long as Palestinians are
under occupation they cannot appear to be ""disloyal"" to their national
narrative: Arab countries are not under occupation, and the lack of
critical intellectuals in all of them is glaring--compared, for example,
to the courageous appearance of many critical intellectuals in
contemporary Iran. And in the Israeli case, critical intellectuals
appeared in the pre-1948 Jewish community, in the excruciating debate
about whether to use terrorist methods against the British.

Will this discrepancy between the disparate self-declared roles of
intellectuals in these two societies change? I don't know. Yet the
appearance of the UNDP Arab Human Development Report, written mostly by
Arab intellectuals, is a meaningful and hopeful harbinger of the
possibilities of a fundamental change.
"
"Pal","Neut","I was astounded by the subject of this issue of bitterlemons, i.e. the
role of intellectuals in the peace process. My gut reaction was to
decline and abstain from writing the essay. In fact, the topic is filled
with hypothetical assumptions, which I believe cannot be used as valid
bases for exploring the subject. It is impossible to attain a procedural
definition of this issue and discuss it according to specific criteria.

However, once I thought the matter through, I decided to wonder about
the issue, rather than discuss it. The reason I accepted after my
initial hesitation was the need to explore the concept that a specific
role for intellectuals actually exists, not only in the political
process, but also in other areas. Do intellectuals have a specific,
predefined function that they should be aware of and act out as one
solid bloc?

If the hidden pretension underlying my question is ""yes""--i.e. that such
a role actually exists--this undoubtedly leads us to a series of
questions that must be answered clearly, in order to be able to define
the subject: Who is the intellectual? What makes he or she one? Should
the intellectual define him or herself or be defined as such? Do
intellectuals form a specific, clearly defined and integral social
category? Do they need to have unified principles, visions and modus
operandi? Do they need to have their own positions, independent from
those of their societies?

I am of the mind that the term ""intellectual"" is a vague concept,
although it might include some common general characteristics. /My/
""intellectual"" may not be considered as such by someone else, because
the matter is purely subjective. The definition is beholden more to
personal evaluation than to objective standardization. (Is everyone
holding a university degree considered an intellectual?) Intellectuals
do not constitute a special social category. They are an integral part
of the social fabric. Some of them come from underprivileged classes
while others are clearly upper-class. Some are secular, others deeply
religious. Some are right-wingers, others leftists. Some are
progressives, others conservative. Some are rural, still others
city-dwellers, and so on. Hence, intellectuals do not share unified
principles, visions and modus operandi. Neither they, nor their beliefs,
may be squeezed together, and pointed in one singular direction. On the
contrary, because they are an integral part of the social fabric, they
reflect a wide variety of principles, visions, and tendencies.

Indeed, because they are intellectuals, their trademark is one of
conflicting positions. Consequently, there is no such thing as a
singular ""point on the compass"" for the actions of intellectuals, and it
is impossible to issue a judgment on which trend is better than another.
Heterogeneity--and not homogeneity--being the basic factor affecting the
positions of those we call ""intellectuals"", the principle that rules
their differences is the multiplicity and variety of their interests.
Each intellectual, in his or her capacity as a member of society, has
interests that might correlate with, or work against, the interests of
others. Thus, achieving these interests is what guides the
""intellectual?s"" course of action.

If the above is true, then there is no basis for this subject that I was
asked to write about--unless it is in someone?s interest to direct the
role of intellectuals in a given direction. This way, intellectuals
might be encouraged to adopt a so-called ""positive role"" in pushing the
peace process forward! If this is truly the motive, it reduces the
intellectuals? breadth of variety. It also introduces a value judgment
categorizing intellectuals as ""those who are with"" and ""those who are
against."" Intellectuals that believe in the process will be deemed ""good
intellectuals."" But those who have reservations about, or are expressly
opposed to the process will be labeled ""bad intellectuals,"" if they are
lucky. In fact, they may be ousted from the intellectuals? list and--in
this world of ""those who are not with us are against us""--squeezed onto
the list of agitators or even terrorists.

There are intellectuals whose interests lie with the political process,
who use their position in a variety of roles to support that process. By
doing so, they not only express their position, but that of all social
groups that see their own interests advanced by the political process.
On the other hand, there are also skeptics, or those who oppose the
process, and whose positions are consequently at odds with those parties
who disagree. In this way, intellectuals, be they pro- or
anti-settlement, do have a role to play.

But if we truly believe in democracy, it is the people?s choice that
must prevail. What we really need to know is who will convince the
majority of the righteousness of his or her position--not who will seek
to impose his or her beliefs on others.
"
"Isr","Neut","Non-violence, unlike pacifism, is not a philosophy that conceptualizes
or envisions a harmonious world, as in ""and the sheep shall dwell with
the wolf."" Indeed, this is a political tactic that takes conflict as its
point of departure and seeks the advantage over its opponent. The use of
non-violence is not simple--it requires the recruitment of large numbers
of participants along with operational coordination, all at a level that
generally exceeds what is required for violent tactics; hence it also
requires leadership of the highest quality. It is easier to recruit a
few hot-headed youth who are prepared to blow themselves up in a second
and earn the status of martyrs, than to recruit thousands of everyday
citizens of all ages and walks of life, to stage a sit-in day and night,
fast, or boycott goods and vital services as an expression of resistance
to occupation or to some other injustice.

Notably, in the vast majority of cases the weaker party in a force
equation opts for non-violent techniques of struggle because it believes
that in this way it will gain favorable public opinion in the world or
shatter the unity of the other side. The use of non-violent resistance
is dependent on context, time and the balance of forces. Accordingly,
whoever adopts this tactic in one circumstance is not necessarily
obliged, ideologically or practically, to adopt it under a different
circumstance. The reverse is also true: whoever opts for violence under
one set of circumstances can, when they change, switch to non-violence.

Thus, in view of the increasingly negative reactions worldwide to the
use of suicide bombings in the current Palestinian Intifada, together
with the tough Israeli military reactions which have in effect brought
about a renewed occupation, and the large numbers of casualties--there
are growing calls among the Palestinians for shifting the emphasis from
violent to non-violent resistance (e.g., the initiative of a-Shafi,
Dakkak and Barghouti, the petition by Palestinian intellectuals against
suicide bombings, etc.) In most cases this is a call not to cease
completely all reliance on arms against Israel, but rather for a partial
or gradual transformation of the means of struggle.

What is likely to be the Israeli reaction to such a change? At the
government level, we may assume that a significant move to adopt
non-violent struggle would be perceived by most decisionmakers as a
serious threat to Israel's interests. If indeed suicide attacks were
replaced, say, by mass sitdown strikes or by commercial strikes,
blocking of roads and the like, then international public opinion,
together with decisionmakers in key countries, would presumably welcome
such a development and increase their support for the Palestinian cause.
Domestically, too, it would be more difficult for the government of
Israel to recruit public support for suppressing acts of non-violent
resistance than for deploying military force against Palestinian centers
of power after bloody terrorist attacks.

Dealing with mass non-violent demonstrations of resistance also demands
particularly creative planning in order to disperse the demonstrations
on the one hand, but without enhancing the resistance leadership and
without losing support domestically and abroad, on the other; it is not
at all clear whether the Israeli decisionmaking system as currently
constituted is capable of dealing with this challenge. Hence we may
assume that the government's response would be to highlight the violent
incidents which undoubtedly will yet take place at Palestinian
initiative, even if the overall trend on the Palestinian side is likely
to be non-violent. Moreover the government would attempt to portray the
shift to non-violence as a tactic designed ultimately to defeat Israel
by alternative means, rather than as a preliminary step toward returning
to sincere peace negotiations.

Some information regarding the anticipated reaction of the Jewish public
in Israel to a Palestinian shift to non-violent resistance can be found
in the results of a survey carried out recently by the American
organization Search for Common Ground. In general the survey's findings
indicate that a majority of this public--78 percent--supports the right
of the Palestinians to act to achieve an independent state of their own,
if toward that end they invoke non-violent means. Sixty-three percent
stated that the government of Israel should not try to prevent
Palestinians from organizing non-violent mass demonstrations. A
majority, 52 percent, also believe that Palestinians have the right to
oppose expansion of settlements by non-violent means, and 52 percent
argued that if the Palestinians were to employ only non-violence for a
significant period of time, the government of Israel would have to
respond with concessions in negotiations over the borders of a
Palestinian state.

Yet only 9 percent of Israeli Jews felt it was likely that a non-violent
Palestinian resistance movement would indeed emerge. In this sense, all
these instances of Israeli openness seem more like an abstract
intellectual exercise than a solid public stand in favor of Israel
responding positively to Palestinian non-violence. Further, in view of
the Israeli Jewish public's ongoing stand in favor of the policies of
the Sharon government and its deep distrust of Palestinian intentions,
an intensive information campaign by the government would likely shift a
majority of the public to a position of sharp opposition to a
Palestinian non-violent resistance campaign--if indeed it were to be
launched.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: You recently said at a lecture that ""you can't build a
mass movement with the current level of violence."" What did you mean by
that and do you think that it still holds true?

A: I think that it is extremely difficult to accommodate civilian
mass resistance with a high level of military clashes and violence
because it affects dramatically the level of risk people are required to
take by just stepping into the streets into a massive civil-based
movement. But people who want to engage in the struggle against the
occupation cannot just wait for things to be suitable for them and by
the book.

Q: Would you call yourself a supporter of non-violent
resistance and why?

A: From the start of this crisis, we have been organizing campaigns
including Palestinians and internationals in which we tried to remove
roadblocks, defy checkpoints, demonstrate in occupied areas and reach
families there. We have been engaged in front of tanks to prevent them
from moving. We have been doing protection work by providing human
shields for people who are threatened and constantly bombarded. We have
people who are now living in homes that are scheduled for demolition by
the Israeli army. We try to protect the homes and prevent punishment for
the families and try to go with farmers to their fields when it is
really risky and dangerous to do so.

Q: Why do you feel that these kinds of activities are important?

A: We need to find a way for the Palestinian masses to join in, in
an active way--not only in remaining steadfast throughout the hardship.
We think that having internationals with us will provide a better
platform to defy the occupation and to report the truth of what is
happening here and to urge the international community to think more
about the need to protect Palestinians when brutal war is being waged
against them.

We also believe that civil-based resistance can indeed be effective in
terms of cracking down on the tools of occupation, mainly the tool of
control. We believe that if we grow more massive we can really affect
this huge network of roadblocks and checkpoints and force the occupation
to rethink its policies in the Palestinian occupied territories.

Q: Does that mean that you do not think that armed resistance
is valid?

A: No, we state clearly that Palestinians have the full right to
resist the occupation with means that they think are suitable. We as the
Palestinian Solidarity Movement have decided, however, that our tool for
resisting the occupation is non-violence.

Q: How might Israel practice non-violence?

A: Occupation alone is a violent action that touches the lives of
everybody who is under the control of the occupier. Recently, I think
that the occupation has taken on a new form and now includes direct
killing of people, creating war zones and bombarding Palestinian areas.
There is no question, however, that the occupation is violent in using
all its of its force to crack down on the will of Palestinians to be
free and independent.

Q: What was your impression of the Common Ground poll that
questions Israelis and Palestinians on their approaches to non-violent
action?

A: On the Palestinian side, I think that Palestinians stated
clearly that we are willing to do whatever it takes to get out of this
mess. There is a large majority that supports non-violence, but that
same majority supports violence as well. That is my interpretation of
the results.

On the Israeli side, I think that most of the questions asked were
irrelevant. In my understanding, if we are to arrive at peace in this
area, we must have an active Palestinian resistance and an active
Israeli anti-war and anti-occupation movement. This is the shortest way
to conclude this conflict in a peaceful solution.

Therefore, on the Israeli side, I did not see questions such as, ""Do you
support Palestinian non-violent resistance?"" as relevant. The relevant
question is, ""Would you be engaged in non-violent direct action against
your government's atrocities and violence in the occupied territories?""
That is what I want to see the poll results for.

Q: You sometimes stage joint demonstrations with Israeli
left-wing groups. How would you evaluate that experience?

A: I am interested in trying to attract as many Israelis as
possible to join in efforts towards ending the Israeli occupation of the
Palestinian territories. I consider this important and it has been
important in all of the different historic examples where people were
fighting against an occupier to liberate themselves on their land.

Secondly, in principle, we are willing to work with Israeli groups who
are willing to join active civil-based resistance against the Israeli
occupation. In particular, the invitation to the Israeli groups must
come from the Palestinian community in which the activity is happening.
By doing things this way, we give priority to Palestinian unity over
Israeli participation.

Now, this is sometimes problematic because some Israeli groups feel that
they are not adequately included in the planning period. But we think
our policy in this regard is right.

Q: How has the Israeli army responded to your joint activities?

A: Evidently, the presence of Israelis and internationals can
defuse the ability of the Israeli army to use greater force against
protestors and make soldiers think twice before starting to shoot or use
force.

But this is not always the case. We have instances where Palestinians
and internationals and sometimes Israelis have been shot at or injured
and treated brutally by the Israeli army. Soon, we will start a campaign
of olive picking, in which Palestinians and internationals and maybe
some Israeli groups will join villagers as they work on olive groves
that are close to settlements and in dangerous areas. In encounters with
settlers, we will have to see how much ""protection"" internationals and
Israelis can provide.
"
"Isr","Neut","The Israeli political system is on the verge of massive transformation.
Traditional distinctions between left and right, doves and hawks, are no
longer valid. From the Likud on the ""right"" to Meretz on the ""left,"" the
vast majority of the Israeli people is converging around the idea of a
two-state solution.

Aware of the existential threat caused by perpetuating the current
status, there is a growing civil non-partisan movement of Israelis
dedicated to a unilateral disengagement from the Palestinians via a
substantive attainable plan, aimed at safeguarding the vital interests
of Israel as a Jewish, democratic state. Guided by a realistic analysis
of the geo-political realities of our region, it seems that
unilateral--although coordinated--disengagement offers a viable
alternative to the dangerous, endless cycle of violence that prevents
any serious peace negotiations.

In the absence of a comprehensive governmental disengagement initiative,
Israel's society, economy, security and major institutions will continue
their current decline. For us Israelis this is truly a matter of life
and death: if we fail to meet the current demographic challenge, we
ourselves will be the agents of the destruction of the State of Israel,
and the Zionist dream will thereby come to an end.

Two assumptions should be made from the outset:

First, despite Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's ""historic"" December 2003
Herzliya speech                        and his recent statement about a
plan to evacuate the Gaza Strip, the Likud Party, currently holding 40
seats in the Knesset, is constrained by its internal central committee
whose politics are significantly more right wing and militant than those
of Likud's overall constituency. As a result of this schism, the party
has neither the capacity nor the will to bring about a disengagement
from the Palestinians in any way that would require more than the
relocation of just a couple of settlements. Likud's official stance
suggests that it has no real intention to ever negotiate a permanent
status agreement.

Secondly, the international community, led by the United States, the
United Nations, the European Union, Russia and moderate Arab states,
such as Egypt, Morocco and Jordan, will support any practicable platform
offered by Israel within the framework of the roadmap. Such support
might include, under particular conditions, the introduction of an
international force to the territories. Such an Israeli initiative,
being pre-coordinated rather than fully unilateral, has therefore a
chance to obtain international legitimacy.

Disengagement between the two peoples has been the underlying logic of
the political process since the early 1990s. However, it seems that
permanent status is not to be reached in the near future. There is
therefore a need for a substantive, well-established plan, one that
would be both responsible and attainable, aimed at safeguarding the
vital interests of the State of Israel and reinforcing national security
in the broadest sense.

A prerequisite for achieving these goals is an initiated unilateral
disengagement--to borders dictated by the needs of security and
demography--as part of a responsible and sovereign decision of the
government of Israel.

The following are the essentials of the plan:

    * The temporary border for this initiated unilateral disengagement
      will be designed to safeguard Israel's vital security, political,
      demographic and economic interests, in addition to the interests
      of settlement and infrastructure. In this scheme, over 80 percent
      of settlers in Judea and Samaria will remain within the borders of
      the State of Israel, while a minimal number of Palestinians will
      also be included;

    * Israel will receive solid long-term international guarantees that
      promote the stability of the region;

    * The Palestinians will not have the right of return to the State of
      Israel;

    * Concurrent with the establishment of the Palestinian state, the
      historic conflict between the sides will be declared at an end. As
      a condition for its establishment, Palestine will be demilitarized;

    * Jewish Jerusalem will be the capital of Israel, while Palestinian
      al Quds will be the capital of the Palestinian state. The area of
      the holy sites will come under a separate special regime, which
      will guarantee unimpeded access and freedom of worship to members
      of all religions;

    * Israel will support any effort towards international/third party
      involvement in the running of the Palestinian territories until
      the setting up of a responsible Palestinian government; and finally

    * Negotiations on permanent status will resume parallel to the above
      process in order to lead to a final comprehensive agreement on all
      core issues including, but not limited to, the final borders
between Israel and Palestine.

Thus a national security and foreign policy plan would be established,
combining unilateral disengagement with a call to simultaneously renew
permanent status negotiations. It would foster international US-led
involvement in the territories and aim at pursuing negotiations,
possibly on the basis of either President Clinton's parameters or the
principles of any of the other recent peace initiatives.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: We have seen many meanings of ""separation"" in this
intifada. Can you talk some about them?

A: One that stands out was the separation plan put out by
Israeli Labor Party leaders Haim Ramon and Shlomo Ben Ami soon after
Ariel Sharon's election as prime minister, as an attempt to find an exit
strategy from the collapse of [the Oslo accords] into military carnage.
It was the plan that put separation into much greater practical
political play in Israel--but the concept was ultimately hijacked by
Sharon into a greater Israel version that we see being implemented now.

The Ramon/Ben Ami plan ironically had some very positive elements to it.
It proposed unilateral separation, not with walls, but with an
international force. Israel would get out of the majority of the
occupied territories but hand them over not to the Palestinian Authority
but to some type of an international mandate. Thus the plan could be
sold as something positive in Israeli eyes because, rather than being
rewarded with more territory, the Palestinian Authority would actually
be ""punished"" by not having authority over the territory that Israel
withdrew from. In addition, Israelis would not have their security put
back in Palestinian Authority hands, which by then they had lost all
trust in.

It was a very clever salable way of bringing in an international force,
which would be a positive development for Palestinians. The
international mandate would then ""reform"" the Palestinian Authority over
a three-year period, and bring the parties to final status issues. To
sell this under the rubric of separation was clever but it was never
taken up, not even by Labor. But I do think it set the stage for a much
wider debate within the Israeli leadership.

Q: How much is separation plausible for Palestinians?

A: If one takes a look at the wall, the first thing that one
must ask is what is being separated from what? The aim is basically to
separate us from them, not necessarily them from us.

In that sense, the wall is a much deeper, concretized form of the
process of separation that began in the Oslo years, which began to
separate Israeli and Palestinian civilians from each other. The majority
of the Palestinian population can no longer ""go over"" into Israel
anymore. Prior to the first Gulf War and the institution of Israel's
permit system, Palestinians went into Israel as workers, shoppers,
visitors--there was, despite the inequities of occupation, an experience
of civilian interaction.

The wall is the final barrier to this interaction between Israelis and
Palestinians as civilians. What is going to continue and even grow, on
the other hand, will be the presence of Israel's military in our lives.
It is a pipe dream that the wall and the cameras and the gates will do
all the policing. Instead, given the complex configuration of the wall,
it is likely that a much greater part of Israel's population is still
going to be interacting with Palestinians as soldiers.

Those of us who are older can remember when Palestinians and Israelis
interacted in more mundane human ways. Now I teach whole generations of
students at university who have never come into contact with Israelis
except as soldiers or settlers. This was one of the great crimes of Oslo
and it will continue to worsen.

Q: What do you see as the sociological impact of this in
the long term?

A: The wall is an attempt to put us ""out of sight, out of mind.""
The idea is that if one cannot see Palestinians, somehow they are not
there. But of course, we are here. We are not separated; we are just
under a new form of Israeli domination. And what this means is that even
if the majority of Israelis don't see us any more under this new form of
domination, there will continue to be a massive drain on their
resources--financially, on their moral resources, and on their moral
capital in the outside world. This kind of vicious apartheid regime is
going to cost Israel dearly both internally and internationally.
Finally, there are the long-term political costs; because the wall is an
attempt to avert finding a real solution, Israel will continue to live
in a permanent state of war.

But the wall has multiple separation aims. The other pernicious aim of
the wall is the separation of Palestinians from their land and
livelihoods; both in terms of the immediate land grabs associated with
its construction and in terms of the long-run of people being forced to
leave in an attempt to make a livelihood. This is about slow transfer
over the long run. It will not succeed, but ""the long run"" is quite a
while and in the meantime, it will have great destructive consequences
for Palestinian society.

Q: One of the aspects that this discussion highlights is
the success with which Israel has co-opted the language of peace.

A: Until a few months ago, one could still hear members of the
Palestinian leadership saying things like, ""the wall is going to bury
the peace process."" One wondered, what peace process were they talking
about? What happened in the Oslo process was that Palestinians had a
much greater stake in peace and the Palestinian leadership, in
particular, clung to the language of the peace process when it was long
gone because they drew their international legitimacy from it.

But when a situation becomes this stark, no amount of language can hide
it. Israel's use of language has become ludicrous--""targeted killings""
for example. To say ""targeted assassinations"" would give those killed
too much political legitimacy, in Israel's eyes. No matter how weak the
European position is, and no matter how completely hypocritical American
positions are, most people in the world see the images.

The gravest problem is that Israeli society refuses to see. Israelis are
blinded by this wall and are waiting for it to solve all their problems.
As such, the wall has bought Sharon what he most crucially wants--time.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: You have recently advocated that the United States take
the lead in creating an international force and imposing a solution on
Israelis and Palestinians. Does the current initiative from US President
George W. Bush correspond with this proposal?

A: Bush is arriving at the right approach, only late. I hope not too
late. Bush learned a negative lesson from the intense involvement of the
Clinton administration and became cautious. His approach was
understandable but unacceptable. It failed to address American interests
in view of the potential for overall escalation. Bush fears failure, but
the current situation is a worse failure from the standpoint of American
interests. If the Middle East continues to burn, Bush's war against
terrorism will seem increasingly pathetic. There has to be another stage
after the war in Afghanistan, but it is impossible under current
circumstances. No one comes here happily to intervene. Bush may not want
to, but he will have to separate Israelis and Palestinians in order to
act against Iraq with the Arab world on his side.

Q: Where does the prospect of an Israeli unilateral move
toward separation fit into your scheme?

A: If I thought an alternative solution would work, I would advocate
it. I have no problem with a fence, but the fact is we're not doing it.
What's easier to deploy, a fence or an international force? Indeed, let
the international force construct the fence. It will need it.

Q: Will this be a fighting force?

A: No one can guarantee the safety of such a force, but it is safe
to assume that neither side would be crazy enough to declare war on the
US and the entire international community. The force would also have a
strong economic component. The Palestinian territories are in
catastrophic shape, everything is destroyed, there is no economy and no
work. Even if we achieve a ceasefire now, but leave the territories to
their own devices, everything will explode again. Hence we need not only
an international force, but an international mandate to rehabilitate the
territories.

Q: Does the Arab League-approved Saudi initiative complement
or complicate the international force idea?

A: If I were President Bush I would convene an international
conference, with UN, US, EU, Russian, Arab (including Palestinian) and
Israeli participation, to discuss the League's proposal. By moving the
conflict from the Israeli-Palestinian sphere to the Israeli-pan-Arab
one, it becomes possible to avoid the trap of Mitchell-Tenet-Zinni,
which under current conditions leads to a dangerous dead end, and to
offer a glimmer of hope to the people of the region. This would also
help Israelis and Palestinians climb down from the roof. Currently
neither is prepared to take the first step. The sides should negotiate
on the basis of the Beirut summit decisions, and an international force
must arrive to separate Israelis and Palestinians.

Q: Are Bush, Sharon and Arafat ""ripe"" for such an American
initiative?

A: Bush is becoming ""ripe"". I don't know about Sharon and Arafat.
Hence we need to speak in terms of imposing a settlement. Israeli public
opinion swings widely from one option to another because it sees no
realistic alternative. Here, for the first time in a year and a half,
there will be a reasonable alternative to Sharon's policies. If the US
takes the lead, Israeli opinion will shift dramatically. With such a
real option on the table and public approval, the government will
acquiesce. If not, the international community can invoke sanctions.

Q: Meanwhile Sharon is bringing the National Religious Party,
with an extreme leader, into the Israeli governing coalition.

A: The world will see Sharon's move as the Israeli reply to the
positive initiatives of Bush and the Arab League.

Q: Does Arafat want an imposed solution? Many in Israel have
frequently argued that he wants to ""internationalize"" the conflict.

A: I wish I knew. And I wish I were certain that what he wants
serves the interests of his people. If the international community,
including his friends in Europe, threatens him with a final divorce, I
hope he'll be rational enough to acquiesce.

Q: How do Egypt and Jordan fit into US considerations?

A: The responsible regimes in the Middle East are in danger of
collapse under local and regional pressure. We all see the intensifying
demonstrations in Cairo and Amman. In order to prevent collapse, Arab
leaders like Egypt's President Mubarrak and Jordan's King Abdullah may
be forced to abandon moderation. Experience shows that war erupts in the
Middle East even when no one wants to fight. The 1967 war is a case in
point. The US has good reason to fear the possibility that responsible
regimes in the Arab-Muslim world will collapse under local and regional
pressure.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What do you see as the way out of this crisis situation?

A: The only way is to withdraw the Israeli military forces that
have occupied the Palestinian cities of the West Bank. When the
withdrawal is competed and when there is the chance to sit and
negotiate, we need to have international protection. We cannot negotiate
under the threat of Israeli tanks and artillery and airplanes; we cannot
negotiate under threat of the renewal of occupation at any moment. There
is a need for international protection. We are asking for it, we are in
need of it and it is an essential part of the negotiations process.

Q: Do you see this coming from the American administration?

A: I think that the international protection should come not
only from the Americans, but from the United Nations, Russia and the
European Union.

Q: There are some who say that the United States' reputation
has been so damaged in Arab eyes that it cannot be involved.

A: I think that the United States has destroyed its credibility
in the Arab world for a very long time. It cannot regain this
credibility unless it starts taking a position that departs from
complete support of [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon's policy of
Israeli war against the Palestinian people and of Israeli occupation of
the Palestinian Authority areas.

Every time we started implementing the Tenet Plan, for example, which is
originally an American plan (all the plans are American plans), the
American administration tends to explain these plans according to the
Israeli interpretation. In Tenet, we refused from the beginning the
condition of seven days without any incident. But the Americans accepted
it and this gave Sharon months of continuing violence against the
Palestinian people, under the pretext that there had not been seven days
of non-violence.

We don't want to have hostile relations with the United States. On the
contrary, we were among the first in the Arab world who condemned the
attacks of September 11, we were the first in the Arab world who said to
Bin Ladin, ""You cannot use the Palestinian cause and you do not
represent Palestinian aspirations."" We were the first in the Arab world
to say that terrorism is not the way to help the just causes of the Arab
states, whether they be national, political or social. But these
positions were not taken into consideration.

On the contrary, the United States has increasingly adopted Israeli
conditions. The Americans themselves say they know that these conditions
are impossible to implement. But they accepted some of them and wanted
us to accept them even though [they knew] that Sharon was playing a game
and asking the US to pressure us.

Q: It has been said that all of this has happened because the
Palestinians were not willing to accept the Zinni paper.

A: Well, look at that paper and you will see why we don't
accept it. In that paper, there are parts and phrases that if we accept
them, we will have to accept what the Israelis are doing now to our
people. We would have to accept the incursions and attacks under the
pretext that this is [Israeli] self-defense to counter imminent
so-called terrorist attacks against Israel.

This paper added a phrase that was not originally in the Tenet plan, and
which contradicts the Tenet plan completely--that Israel will not make
incursions in the Palestinian Authority areas, unless they are in
self-defense or against imminent attacks. Who will interpret this? Of
course, the Israelis, who will consider every attack as self-defense and
say that they have information that a terrorist attack is imminent.

If we accepted this, we would be worse than [South Lebanese Army
commander] Antoin Lahad--not only an agent, but an accomplice with the
Israelis against our own people. The Israelis knew that it would be
impossible for us to accept such conditions and the Americans, either
with goodwill or full knowledge, fell into that trap.

Q: What about the Saudi proposal?

A: The Saudi proposal represents our policy. We have said from
the beginning that we want normalization of relations between the
countries of the region, but on the basis of international resolutions,
especially 224 and 338, and the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state within the borders of June 4, 1967 including East
Jerusalem.

This is our policy, in spite of the current difficult moment, in spite
of the bloodshed, the war crimes against our people, in spite of the
destruction we are facing in our cities and infrastructure, in spite of
the Israelis killing hundreds and injuring thousands and despite that
their army has entered every ministry and Palestinian institution.
Nobody should believe that they are targeting terrorism. They targeted
those who made peace with them and without whom there would be no peace:
the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian leadership.

For Sharon, the enemy is not terrorism, the enemy is peace. The
representative of peace on the Palestinian side is the Palestinian
Authority and its institutions. That is why they targeted them and did
great damage to the security services--the same security services that
the Americans are asking to control violence and put an end to the
situation.

They have created an atmosphere of utmost nationalist hatred among the
Israeli people against the Palestinian people and some of our extremists
helped them in doing this through the suicide attacks, which we condemn
and do not represent us, nor the Palestinian people. These have been
used to destroy the bridges of peace and to create channels of blood
between us. We believe that peace will be the future. The enemies of
peace, those who are ruling in Israel, will be defeated.
"
"Isr","Neut","It would be relatively easy for Israel to destroy the military forces of
the Palestinian Authority and reconquer all the territories. Yet not
only would this not decide the conflict with the Palestinians, it would
clearly endanger Israel's very existence as a democratic country with a
solid long-term Jewish majority. Israel would again find itself ruling
over more than three million Palestinians (in addition to more than one
and a quarter million inside the state), and embroiled in an accelerated
process of losing the Jewish majority in the territories under its control.

Within about a decade the Jews will lose their majority between the
Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. Given this circumstance,
Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat assesses that time is working in favor
of his people and there is no pressing need for a settlement. On the
contrary, in his view the absence of a settlement serves the
Palestinians' long-term interests, even if in the short-term it involves
great suffering. Hence, paradoxically, an Israeli withdrawal, separation
and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside
Israel have become an overriding Israeli interest and a desired
solution--while for the Palestinians this is at best a default solution
that in any event would be received with mixed emotions and a sense of
historic loss.

The Israeli-Palestinian confrontation differs from the Israel-Arab
inter-state conflict in several critical senses. One of these emerges
from the political connotations of communal identity. The sharp defeat
that Israel administered in 1967 to the Arabs, led by Abd al-Nasser, was
more than a typical military setback. The Six-Day War led to the demise
of the ideas that Nasser personified, and at their center his messianic
pan-Arab message. In parallel, the territorial Arab state became
institutionalized and even reinforced its public legitimacy. Arab
politics became more pragmatic, with the Arab states seeking to ensure
their particularistic political interests without ideological trappings.
The Arab states bordering on Israel have no interest in waging a
perpetual war against a strong Israel. Moreover, there is an
international juridical foundation of inter-state borders that can serve
as at least a legal basis for reaching peace settlements that in effect
embody finality.

Palestinian territorialism does not limit the conflict to known and
recognized international borders, because there are none. And
Palestinian territorial identity does not stop at the 1967 boundaries.
Hence agreements that embody finality with the Palestinians are much
more difficult to achieve, and may indeed be unattainable. Further, the
Palestinians' very communal identity was molded in the course of a
bitter conflict between Jews and Arabs over the fate of the Land of
Israel. Their defeat in 1948 was a traumatic formative experience.
Defeat and exile are the conscious pillars of the Palestinian shared
fate and national cohesiveness. In the conflict between Israel and Arab
states it is possible to reach agreements by solving the problems
created in 1967, by withdrawing from territories conquered then, without
challenging the existence of the State of Israel. But on the Palestinian
track it is far more difficult, perhaps impossible, to do so.

On the Palestinian track, alongside the ""1967 questions"" that await
solutions there are also ""1948 questions"" whose resolution is liable not
merely to detract from Israel's territorial dimensions, but to strike at
its very existence as a Jewish state. At the top of the list of ""1948
questions"" are two fundamental problems that Israel will be hard put to
solve in ways that satisfy Palestinian national demands: one is the 1948
refugee problem and the right of return, and the other is the national
identity of Palestinians who are Israeli citizens and have increasing
difficulty coming to terms with Israel as the national state of the
Jewish people. Hence on the Palestinian track it is more realistic to
think only in terms of managing and controlling the conflict rather than
solving it with ""finality.""

Under these circumstances, Israel cannot allow itself to leave Arafat or
any other Palestinian leadership the right to veto fateful
decision-making for the State of Israel. They must not be permitted, in
view of their avoidance of a settlement, to lock Israel into a status
quo that works to its detriment. The establishment of a Palestinian
state alongside Israel, even as a consequence of unilateral separation,
is thus specifically in the Israeli interest. Separation in this sense
means not only an enhancement of Israel's near-term security through the
construction of a security fence, dismantling of isolated settlements
and more rational military deployment. It also means ensuring the very
long-term existence of the Jewish state by guaranteeing its Jewish
majority and creating a controlled and restricted border.

Failure to take these steps will sooner or later lead Israel into the
South Africa model. No longer two states for two peoples, but rather one
country between the river and the sea where Palestinian Arabs are a
growing majority. At that point Israel will find itself struggling with
a Palestinian demand that is already being heard on both sides of the
Green Line, for majority rule in a single country. If the State of
Israel wishes to survive, it must do all in its power to avoid such a
sorry reality of tragic bloodshed for both sides, caused by their lack
of awareness or incapacity to make fateful decisions.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: Do you believe in solving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict
by establishing one secular, democratic state?

A: Ideally, yes. I believed in a one-state solution because I do
not think that religious beliefs can constitute legitimacy for any kind
of political state. All along, that is why the Palestinians refused the
partition scheme.

But now we are at this stage in history. I feel that once the United
Nations was conceived and established as a haven for the oppressed and a
safeguard for injustice everywhere and as a venue for resolving
conflict, this became the most legitimate forum for resolving our
problem. I therefore believe that the next step should be a two-state
solution based on all the relevant United Nations resolutions. All of them.

Whether these states will eventually become one, nobody knows. I am
talking about the resolution at this time in the history of the
Palestinian question.

Q: Has the intifada changed your views on this in anyway?

A: The intifada has actually reaffirmed my conviction that the
Palestinian people will never remain still until their rights are
restored. The question is not merely a matter of state or statehood.
Statehood is a culmination of a restoration and recognition of
Palestinian rights.

The Palestinian right of return, self-determination, rights to
compensation for the pains--there are so many rights that have been
totally ignored. Once these rights have been confirmed, restored and
recognized, then naturally we are going to have a state because
self-determination is one of these rights. The question is, of course,
how and when.

This is something that I would like to emphasize. Negotiations have been
taking place, but one does not negotiate over rights. One negotiates
over means and timetables. That's it. Once these inalienable rights are
recognized, then we start coming to the negotiating table.

Q: How can Palestinians make this happen?

A: Now we are entering a very low ebb in our struggle. The Israeli
military machinery, the American machinery, overwhelm us.

Maybe we will not be able to achieve anything now, but we should be
visionary about whatever solution we are going to have. The power of the
masses is sometimes much stronger than military power because it is more
legitimate. It emanates from conviction and belief and has deeply
imbedded historical roots.

If oppressive powers continue to really undermine human values and
principles of justice, they will be isolated. I probably will not see
that happen during my lifetime, but I have faith in the future.

Q: Right now, due to the Israeli closure, families are
divided. In a short while, people from Gaza won't even know Palestinians
from the West Bank. These are now facts. How do Palestinians get past
those things?

A: By sheer resilience, endurance, solidarity and a staunch belief
in the eventual victory of justice. I hope that there are voices inside
Israel that will realize that this is very detrimental to the future.
And I hope that the world will wake up one day and concentrate on the
basic issue of occupation, and not on side issues. All of these issues
emanate from the occupation and the dispossession of the Palestinians.
The problem did not start in 1967, mind you, it started in 1948. Half of
the Palestinian people are out of Palestine. Do these people not exist?

Israel is trying to create facts on the ground using the most oppressive
means in the hope that we will start licking the bone they are throwing
us. We are not asking for charity. We are not a people--as Mr. Bush
says--who need a better life away from our day-to-day problems. If our
rights are restored, we do not need anyone's charity.

We have our land, we have our human resources, we are enterprising
people, we have been building our country despite all hardships and
obstacles. There is no horizon for anything at this moment, but I always
believe in miracles. I always believe that out of this darkness a flash
of light will come and shake the whole world into awareness of what is
taking place.

If you are going to ask me now what I see for the next year, I don't
know. What is happening is surreal. And what is worse is that the whole
world is watching in silence. What they are talking about--reforms?
Democracy? What is this nonsense? Is this democracy when the United
States is interfering in our leadership? Is it not corruption when
congressmen are being bought by various lobbies in the United States?

The most important thing is to end the occupation and liberate
Palestinian land from settlements. We can't even breath. Even at the
peak of the peace process, the first thing that they did was to isolate
Jerusalem and Gaza from the West Bank. Gradually we became cantons here
and there. So it was a process of dispossession, not a peace process.
And fait accompli established by aggression and oppression and state
terrorism.

Q: Is it correct to say that the restoration of Palestinian
rights means that Israel will no longer be a Jewish state?

A: They planted themselves in our land. If they had their own land
that they had not confiscated from us, and they wanted it to be Jewish
or Muslim or Buddhist, I would not care less. But they have taken our
land and whether their state is Jewish or otherwise is not my concern.

What is happening is like a fire consuming everybody in the area. We who
have lived on this land and seen the suffering of the people, we have
seen the fire of Israeli aggression consuming the self. I wish they
would wake up to what is taking place. I wish they had the wisdom to
stop and look deep within themselves to recognize the historic crime
they committed against the Palestinians. This should be the starting
point.
"
"Isr","Neut","The Oslo agreements                                             were not
a coincidence of history. In practical terms, the Israeli and
Palestinian leaderships finally agreed that violence got them only
deeper into trouble. In political terms, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
and Chairman Yasir Arafat needed the legitimacy of a deal. In conceptual
terms, the Oslo agreements, signed in September 1993, had been conceived
15 years earlier, in September 1978, when Prime Minister Menahem Begin
and President Anwar Sadat signed the Camp David accords.
                                            

After twelve years of political stagnation and the unleashing of a
steadily growing vicious circle of violence, the concept of the Camp
David accords was revived, and was put on the table in a moderate form
during the second secret meeting held in Norway. At the first meeting,
in January 1993, heading the very small Israeli team, I made it clear to
my Palestinian interlocutors that Palestinian self-government in
agreement with Israel would lead to a two-state solution, Israel beside
Palestine, and Palestine beside Israel, both committed to good
neighborly relations.

Following one hundred years of bitter conflict, none of us imagined that
the way to peace would be easy. We also understood that the two-stage
concept defined in the Camp David accords of 1978 created two major
problems:

First, it was open-ended, i.e. the difficult issues of sovereignty over
territories, borders, settlements, Jerusalem and refugees were all not
dealt with and the search for a compromise solution was postponed, by
agreement, to the next stage. And secondly, the two-stage approach gave
plenty of time for both sides' spoilers to get organized and to
undermine the Oslo agreements.

We knew all of this. We also knew that the most logical way out, to go
immediately to a single stage comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreement, was not doable; no preparatory work had been done and neither
the Israeli nor the Palestinian leadership was yet willing to tell the
public what the price for peace would be.

We thought that the way out would be to start immediately with the
preparatory work and then move very fast from the first interim stage to
a comprehensive peace agreement. This work took 14 months, and was
concluded at the end of October 1995. Earlier the same month, Prime
Minister Rabin announced in the Knesset that he wanted to conclude a
comprehensive peace agreement with Arafat before the next elections,
scheduled for October 1996. Rabin informed President Clinton that he had
chosen to move along the ""Palestinian track"", and hence would not
negotiate with Syria. We also knew that by moving towards a two-state
solution we destroyed ideological beliefs on both sides--the dreams of
greater Israel and of greater Palestine. Those who were committed to
these dreams would not easily renounce them.

Today we are in a similar situation to that of 1978. Then we had the
Camp David Accords. Today, we have the Clinton proposals
                                               , the roadmap and the
Arab plan                                               .

Failed negotiations can be of great historical relevance as they often
produce concepts and ideas that do show the way for conflict resolution.
The Clinton proposals suggested the restitution of 97 percent of the
territories of the West Bank and Gaza occupied in 1967, a comprehensive
plan to deal with the Palestinian refugee issue and the division of
Jerusalem into a Jewish and a Palestinian city.

The roadmap, issued almost two years later and supported by the US
government, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations, devised a
three-stage plan to get there. First, end violence and create
stabilization; second, establish a Palestinian state with provisional
borders; and third, go for a comprehensive peace deal.

In spring 2002 in Beirut, an Arab summit conference agreed on a
complementary plan that could actually lead the way to peace between
Israel and all 22 Arab states, in the event that the roadmap and the
Clinton proposals were put into practice.

At the moment, every side still fears that the other side is out to
trick it. Yet on the Israeli side, most of the taboos preventing a
permanent status agreement have been broken. The PLO has been
recognized, the majority of Israelis supports the two-state solution,
the partition of Jerusalem is no longer a taboo, and the understanding
on territorial arrangements is that they will have to be based on the
June 4, 1967 line with equal exchange of territories. It is not certain
that the taboos have been broken on the Palestinian side. In order to
reach a deal, the Palestinian side will have to recognize that the
Jewish people has the right to exercise its right of self-determination
in Israel. Regarding the refugee issue, in the common search for a fair
and just resolution, both sides will have to recognize that the right of
return of the Palestinian people is to their homeland the State of
Palestine whereas the right of return of the Jewish people is to their
homeland the State of Israel.

Any student of history knows that the moment when both the Israeli and
Palestinian peoples have conceptually agreed on the guidelines of a
peace agreement, getting there will only be a question of time and
political architecture.

In my view, we should all agree that the time has come to redouble our
effort and get there as soon as possible.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: When you remember the time that you spent negotiating
the Oslo accords                                            , do you
remember it fondly, or is it troubling?

A: This is an experience that I am not totally happy with and
also not totally unhappy with. After many years of total Israeli
blockade on the recognition of Palestinian rights, to come
forward--regardless of how--and sit on the other side of the table and
start talking with the Palestinians about their rights and aspirations
was in itself a serious undertaking, one we got into hoping that we
would eventually come to everlasting peace.

Of course, during the negotiations, we had many ups and downs because on
the one hand, so many ""trivial"" issues (from the Palestinian
perspective) were met with total Israeli denial. We realized that the
Israelis were able to stall the negotiations and delay a lot of
progress, just because they are the mighty power and we are a very weak
partner.

On the other hand, we came to know more of the worries of the Israeli
side, their aspirations for the future, and we managed to pass on to the
Israelis the kind of aspirations that we have for our people and the
fact that the Palestinians are equally worthy of a state on their own
soil, after all.

Q: Can you give an example of one of these ""trivial"" issues?

A: For example, as far as the Palestinians are concerned,
historic Palestine is Palestinian territory. For us and the Israelis to
spend so much time discussing whether we have legitimate rights in the
West Bank and Gaza, including Jerusalem, from our perspective was a very
trivial thing. From the Israeli perspective, on the other hand, it was
negotiable. Whenever they questioned the content of [United Nations
Resolution] 242, whenever they tried to deny it or give a special
explanation to 242, it was for us a triviality used by the Israelis to
stall the negotiations.

But we also came to know many Israeli negotiators who, on a personal
level, were understanding and maybe in agreement with our aspirations,
but on an official level were not able to even come close to recognizing
Palestinian aspirations.

Q: It is now ten years later and in many respects Oslo has
been voided. What achievements do Palestinians still cling to?

A: The fact that we are no longer discussing whether or not
we have legitimate rights, the international consensus that there is a
need for a Palestinian state--although with some requirements--are both
direct results of Oslo. Some of the relationships that the Palestine
Liberation Organization had with some members of the international
community were very much conditional, compared to today when members of
the international community deal with us on almost equal footing.

Q: In hindsight, what aspects of the accords have proven to
be disastrous?

A: There is one fundamental aspect: the fact that the Oslo
agreement was based on the principle of good will and good performance.
The Palestinians didn't perform well in terms of realization of the Oslo
agreement vis-a-vis their entity and also, the transitional aspect of
the agreement has proved to be very seriously defective because there
was a lot of bad faith.

I think that the agreement was fully dependent on the good faith of both
sides. Each side had its own clock in terms of how to deal with the
agreement and the applications of the agreement. When it came to
reality, we realized that these expectations and modalities were not
necessarily based on good faith.

Q: If Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had not been
killed, would it have worked?

A: I think the difference between Rabin and the rest of the
Israeli leadership was that he had a fundamental change of direction
vis-a-vis his perception of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship. He was
keen on reaching some kind of an arrangement that would be acceptable to
Israelis with minimum harm, and that would be able to provide the
Palestinians with the minimum requirements for establishing a state. I
cannot say that if he had not been killed, the situation would be
fundamentally different. I think that each side had theorized a
compromising situation that was not close enough to the other sides?.

Even with Rabin, we would have had problems, but at least the
Rabin-Arafat relationship was a little more frank and candid. They could
have avoided some of the mishaps that we are seeing now.

Q: How would you say that the Oslo accords altered the way
that Palestinians think about themselves?

A: First of all, before the Oslo agreement, we knew very
little about what we could really reach with the Israelis. We had the
[UN] resolution; the resolution has some very theoretical strategic
goals that it wants to achieve.

Suddenly, out of the blue, we have come to realize that an agreement
will definitely test what constitutes the Palestinian population. It
introduced, probably for the first time, the very real challenge of
looking for a potential solution to the refugee issue. The Palestinians
have started to realize that the Palestinian state will be a state of
the population of the West Bank and Gaza, with some arrangements for the
diaspora. The Palestinians, for the first time, have started to look
inward to see what compromises they will have to make concerning the
rest of the [issues] that have been postponed.

This is why I think that the Oslo agreement has presented a very serious
challenge to the Palestinians in terms of settling some questions that
they have avoided: concerning their identity, their relationship to
Palestinians outside Palestine, their relationship to Israeli
Palestinians in Israel and so on.

Q: Palestinians often give their prescription for a real
return to negotiations: Israel's demonstration of intent through troop
withdrawals and a prisoner release and a halt in settlement
construction. But in your mind, how can Palestinians contribute to that
transformation of Israeli society? Or can they only wait?

A: Palestinians are committing one of their biggest mistakes
in not reaching out to Israeli public opinion. I think the Palestinians
have a very serious and just cause, but the problem is that they are not
demonstrating to the Israeli public, through various mediums, that they
mean business and that they have produced the historic compromise of
accepting Israel as a neighbor and that much of the violence and
fundamentalism that is taking place is due to the harsh realities within
Palestinian society and economy and the harsh treatment by the Israeli
military of the Palestinian population.

The Israelis have consistently failed to realize that the Palestinians'
experience with Israelis is always one of shame and humiliation. The
Palestinians' first-hand experience with an Israeli is either with
settlers or jailers or army officers or employers in Israel. In all
these cases, there is a huge inequality in terms of treatment. This is
true for the Israelis, too; they typically see a Palestinian in the form
of a terrorist or a suicide bomber.

The Palestinians haven't had their big leap forward in reaching out to
Israeli society, and Israelis have not worked hard enough to earn the
privilege of being a good neighbor to the Palestinians.
"
"Isr","Neut","Three almost-simultaneous events--the reelection of George W. Bush, the
demise of Yasser Arafat, and the Knesset passage of Ariel Sharon's
disengagement plan--provide a stellar opportunity for advancing Middle
East policy not seen since the American victories in the Cold War and
the Gulf War in 1991. The new constellation of events brings us full
circle, since the last one resulted in the mistaken bet on Arafat,
through Oslo, as the founder of a Palestinian state-in-the-making.

The last order, that of relying upon Arafat to take Palestinians to
their ""promised land"", collapsed when Arafat turned down the state
offered to him at Camp David and launched a terror war against Israel.
That war was itself discredited by the attacks of September 11, which
created a global divide between states and entities that support
terrorism, on the one hand, and their victims, led by the United States
(and Israel), on the other.

In June 2002, Bush applied the new global order to the Arab-Israel
conflict when he called on the Palestinians to ""elect new leaders,
leaders not compromised by terror"". Bush simultaneously deepened the
American commitment to Palestinian statehood while, for the first time,
making that commitment contingent on Palestinian actions--democratic
reforms and ending terrorism.

Unlike in Afghanistan and Iraq, the US did not set about trying to make
regime change happen, and may or may not have prevented Israel from
doing so. The result was a stalemate in which all there was to do was
wait for Arafat to leave the scene, one way or another. Now he has.

Initially, the old adage, ""if you don't know what to do, do what you
know"", is likely to hold sway. This means attempting to revive the
frozen American-European roadmap. But if new/old leaders maintain
Arafat's refusal to use the ample political and military forces at their
disposal to combat terror, the roadmap will remain as stuck as it ever was.

Rather than follow the roadmap into the same old dead end, it would
behoove the parties to take this moment to think slightly out of the
box. For the Palestinians, this would begin with absorbing the wider
context.

As far as Bush is concerned, America has much bigger fish to fry than
forcing the Palestinians to accept a state that, under Arafat, they did
not want and wouldn't take action to bring about. Unlike his
predecessor, Bush does not believe that transformation of the region
revolves around the Arab-Israel conflict, but the opposite. It is now
obvious that Bush and even Sharon believe in a genuine two-state
solution more than Arafat ever did, but they are content to wait until
there is a Palestinian leadership that believes in one as well.

The main litmus test for Palestinian seriousness on this score is not
just the abandonment of terrorism, but of the ""one state solution"", also
known as the ""right of return"". When a Palestinian leadership abandons
the challenge to Israeli sovereignty posed by the Palestinian claim of
the right to live in Israel, the conflict will, in principle, be over.
Ami Ayalon and Sari Nusseibeh have (unlike the ""Geneva Accord"") already
provided such a formula: ""Palestinian refugees will return only to the
State of Palestine; Jews will return only to the State of Israel"".

Regardless of what Sharon says, disengagement and perhaps even the
completion of the security fence will in fact be entirely tied to
Palestinian actions. So if a Palestinian leadership wants to stop these
unilateral Israeli actions, it has the power to do so by taking the
steps that would make a negotiating track desirable and irresistible.

The tactical challenge for the international community, including the
Bush administration, will be to avoid doing the Palestinian leadership
the ""favor"" of lowering its standards of compliance with the roadmap's
stop-terror-first sequence. This would ensure yet another Arafat-style
stalemate, not to mention the loss of more Palestinian and Israeli lives.

The strategic challenge, if the promise of this moment is to be
realized, is for the US to demand that the Arab states help pull the rug
out from under Arafat's old one-state game. This means saying out loud
that the demand of ""return"" to Israel won't fly because it is
inconsistent with the world's two-state vision. A good start would be
for President George W. Bush, though he has already said it once, to
repeat this principle enough to make it a central pillar of his
second-term Middle East policy.

Arafat's demise holds the promise of ending Palestinian helplessness.
The outside world can assist by saying so, and by shining a spotlight on
the root cause of the conflict: the inability of the Palestinians and
the Arab world to reject the one-state fantasy, in the form of the
assertion of an asymmetrical Palestinian ""right"" to immigrate to
Israel.
"
"Pal","Neut","In politics there is a vast difference between the ability to influence
the policy-making process and simply hoping for change. At the moment,
that difference is grossly in evidence with regard to the position of
some Palestinian and Arab circles toward the re-election of George W.
Bush. Over the past four years, these circles have suffered tremendously
from Bush's policies in the region, his unquestioned support for Israel,
his war on Iraq, and the ramifications of the so-called war on
terrorism. However, they have never actively stood up to these policies.
Rather, they meekly waited in, as it turned out, the vain hope that Bush
would not win a second term.

After Tuesday's vote, these people will now cling to the possibility
that changes will nevertheless occur over the next four years. This
wishful thinking is based on the assumption that, in his second term,
the US president will be free of the pressures from special interest
lobbies and influential electoral groups whose votes he no longer needs.
As such, some people argue that Israel's influence on President Bush
will decrease along with the influence of the pro-Israel lobbies. This,
they reason, will ultimately lead to him taking on more positive and
balanced policies, especially when it comes to a political settlement
and the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian
state on the 1967 borders. As evidence of the validity of their theory,
such people point to the concerns and fears expressed by Israeli circles
in this regard.

It would be a terrible mistake, however, to resort to such a superficial
argument. It is true that Bush could free himself from electoral
pressures in his second term, but this depends on his desire to do so.
Hence, the question remains: does Bush really want to change his policies?

The answer, in my opinion, is a resounding no. There are three reasons
for this. First, Bush's perspective in his policies toward the region in
general and Israel and the Palestinian cause in particular are guided by
ideological and religious beliefs and not only political and
interest-based politics. This ideological vision springs from the
convictions of the American right, particularly the neo-conservatives,
and will continue to determine America's policies toward the region.

Second, Israel has become an integral part of domestic rather than
foreign policy in the United States, and Israel enjoys wide popular
support. Hence policy decisions are made not only in the White House but
also in Congress, and any American president or even a presidential
candidate cannot afford--even if he wanted to--not to take this into
consideration.

Third, in order for there to be any radical change in American policies
toward the Arab region in general and the Palestinian case in particular
the total absence of any Arab effort in applying pressure on Washington
must be rectified. The Arab effort in this regard has been reduced to a
matter of pleading. Pleading is evidence of weakness and will not change
any policies. On the contrary, it only invites exploitation.

Having said that there will be no change in Bush's policies toward the
region and the Palestinian cause during his second term, however, does
not mean there will be no action toward a political settlement behind
the scenes. On the contrary, Bush is very interested in this especially
since Israel has a stake in it and given that Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon wants his withdrawal plan from Gaza to be a success.
Sharon's interest lies in his desire to determine the form of any
Palestinian state according to Israeli interests.

In addition, Bush's allies, Britain in particular, want to mend
American-European relations and they want to address the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, as well as the reckless policy toward Iraq
and the Arab region in general. In this regard, the US may push for a
political settlement to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict to appease its
European allies, especially since both Washington and Israel believe
that the absence of President Arafat from the political scene will open
the door for a Palestinian acceptance of a minimal settlement.

However, those Palestinians and Arabs who express optimism in this
regard should prepare themselves for tremendous pressure to accept a
settlement according to Israeli conditions, which would grant them only
a nominal ""state"" with limited ""autonomy."" If these people expect Bush
to pressure Israel into accepting the establishment of an independent
and sovereign Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, they will remain
what they always have been--delusional.
"
"Isr","Neut","Israeli-Palestinian relations have visibly entered a new phase, as the
two exhausted sides appear to be rethinking their conflict policies
after over 38 months of stalemated fighting. The indicators of the
change are obvious. On the Palestinian side, the rise of Abu Ala (Ahmed
Qurei) as prime minister has led to a new ceasefire initiative, which
could serve as a platform for upcoming negotiations with Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon. At the same time, there is a growing recognition
in Israel that a decisive military victory over the Palestinians is
beyond reach, and that therefore some compromise could serve the
country's interests better than a prolonged war of attrition.

The mutual fatigue, which has already brought both Israelis and
Palestinians to lower the conflict's intensity, gives the current effort
to stop the violence a better chance to succeed than previous, failed
attempts. Other factors support this optimistic assessment. Sharon has
lost his magic grip over Israeli public opinion, and lags behind in his
approval ratings. The Israeli consensus over the war has been torn
apart, as the previously mute left wing regained the political
initiative with a series of endeavors, from the refusenik pilots to the
Geneva accords and the public warning by four retired security chiefs.
Under domestic attack, Sharon pledged a new diplomatic initiative, and
hinted at a possible removal of settlements in Gaza as part of a
unilateral package.

Sharon faces strong criticism from the right and within his Likud Party,
but powerful players have adhered to his new, moderate tone. The Israel
Defense Forces, which have long advocated a forceful showdown in order
to ""burn the Palestinian consciousness"" against using terrorism, have
changed course. Instead of using more force, the military now advocates
a quick withdrawal from Palestinian West Bank cities and entry into
negotiations, fearing that ""time is on the Palestinians' side"". Ehud
Olmert, Sharon's loyal deputy, calls for a deep unilateral withdrawal
from the occupied territories, in order to save Israel's Jewish majority
and character. Olmert's call is heresy by Likud standards; nevertheless
Sharon tacitly backed him, signaling that Olmert is his political
pathfinder.

Abu Ala has tried his best to avoid the hurdles which ruined his
predecessor Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) and led to the latter's swift
resignation. The new premier avoided meeting Sharon before forging a
Palestinian consensus. He even refrained from asking for American
support, while Washington was careful not to ""hug"" him. And most
importantly, instead of appearing to oust Yasir Arafat, Abu Ala has
willingly bowed to the veteran leader's authority and declared himself
his loyal subordinate. By giving away any claim to wield security
authority, Abu Ala aimed to keep Arafat on his side. Sharon has
grudgingly accepted the new-old order, and even praised Abu Ala's
political experience and shrewdness as good signs.

Alas, the same factors also work against the new calming efforts and
diminish their chances for success. Sharon's weakness guarantees that he
will find it difficult to recruit political support for compromise. True
to form, following an initial moderate opening Sharon resorted to his
usual threatening mode, and warned the Palestinians that if they fail to
make a deal with him, they might be locked behind fences and remain in
control of less than half of the West Bank.

Israel treats Abu Ala in a cold, businesslike manner, without the summit
atmosphere that enveloped its dealings with Abu Mazen. But this obvious
lack of enthusiasm makes it harder to convince the wary Israeli public
that there is a new opportunity. Moreover, Israel disapproves of Abu
Ala's declared policy of prolonged ceasefire rather than the uprooting
of terrorism, and rejects outright his demand to stop security fence
construction in the West Bank. And the Arafat patronage may have helped
legitimize Abu Ala domestically, but the old leader's return to center
stage is an assured recipe for trouble with Israel, especially since all
Palestinian security forces report to Arafat.

The American distance from the scene will only grow as the November 2004
presidential elections draw closer. Washington is still engaged in
micromanaging the conflict, mainly to prevent Israel from prejudging the
final status through fence and settlement construction. This is
insufficient, however, to draw both sides toward a genuine compromise.

But the main obstacle for a real breakthrough has not changed since the
outbreak of violence in late summer 2000: Israel's proposals are far
below the minimum acceptable to the Palestinians. Even the ""virtual""
Geneva accord                                               , which
bespeaks a better deal for the Palestinians than the rejected Barak
proposals of Camp David and Taba, failed to gain strong Palestinian
endorsement. Clearly, the Palestinians will never accept any less
generous proposition by Sharon, even if he continues down the path of
withdrawal and settlement evacuation.

Thus there is a good chance for a period of relative quiet. But the
underlying causes of the conflict are bound to undermine it eventually
and prevent any deeper change.
"
"Pal","Neut","If all things go as planned, Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei and
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will likely meet this week or the
following one. For some time, the peoples of the region and outside
officials and observers have been awaiting this important meeting. In
fact, this meeting has been awaited ever since Sharon took power in the
2001 Israeli elections. Since that time he has refused to meet with
Palestinian leaders until what he calls ""terror attacks"" end. Sharon
also vowed not to meet with elected Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
whom he has placed under virtual house arrest for the past two years.

True, Sharon met Prime Minster Mahmoud Abbas, but that event seems to
have evaporated like a morning mist, because obviously no issue of
substance was discussed.

It is unclear where the meeting will take place. Undoubtedly, Mr. Sharon
will pass on the suggestion that it be held in the /muqata'a/
(Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Ramallah headquarters) and Mr. Qurei
will undoubtedly refuse to meet on Palestinian lands that lie on the
other side of the wall. Geneva is of course out of the question for the
Likud leader, and the idea of Sharon's farm in the Negev will not gain
Palestinian approval.

The Palestinian and Israeli publics are too exhausted to pay attention
to the final location of the meeting. These last three years have seen
so much killing, destruction, fear and hatred that the slim light of
hope offered by any meeting will be much more important than most other
details.

Of course, there is no doubt that for Palestinians and Israelis this
upcoming meeting will mark an indirect recognition by both parties of
their failure. Neither side can claim to having succeeded in landing the
knockout punch to the other. Most Palestinians and Israelis are more
like tired boxers in the 100th round, in which neither is able to win
nor willing to admit defeat.

That is why the various political ideas (Yossi Beilin and Abed Rabbo's
Geneva), the signature drives (Sari Nusseibeh and Ami Ayalon's People's
Voice), as well as the various statements of the Israeli army chief of
staff, former security chiefs and the pilots all add to the pressure on
the leaders to get moving.

In order to break the cycle of violence, the idea of one side crushing
the other side must be removed. Israeli thinking that yet one more
assassination will cause the Palestinians to crumble and the Palestinian
belief that one more suicide attack will cause the Israelis to raise the
white flag have proved to be futile. India's Mahatma Ghandi once said
that an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth leaves the whole world
blind and toothless. There has to be a stop to this zero sum game and a
return to a sane policy based on reciprocity, compromise and reasonability.

Prime Minister Qurei is correct in trying to put an end to the craziness
of the past three years during which the cycle of violence has not
ceased. The past shows that the first order of business must be a
ceasefire between the Israeli government and all its military and
intelligence subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Palestinian Authority
with all the Palestinian factions, on the other. Such an agreement must
put an end to all types of military and armed attacks, as well as
assassinations. This agreement needs to be monitored by a neutral third
party. This could be done by the Quartet, led by the United States of
America.

Finally, such a ceasefire must be supported by concerted round-the-clock
negotiations aimed at ending the basic reason for the violence, namely
the occupation of the Palestinian areas and determining the issues of
borders, settlements, refugees and Jerusalem. At present the Palestinian
people and leadership seem to be genuinely ready for a settlement.
Israelis are also ready. The big question is whether the Sharon
government is willing and able to make an historic agreement.
"
"Isr","Neut","When Ariel Sharon revealed his plan to evacuate Israeli settlements from
Gaza and beyond, he was not simply shifting the focus away from the
scandals facing his family. The investigations may have accelerated or
delayed the process, but from an Israeli perspective, the logic of
unilateral disengagement is inescapable. As one of the founders of
Israel's post-1967 settlement policy, Sharon resisted this approach for
a long time. But if he had not announced this move, another leader would
have. If he is forced to resign, his successor is likely to follow a
similar course.

Public opinion polls and other indicators demonstrate that the majority
of Israelis view the territorial status quo, based on a Swiss-cheese map
of intertwined Palestinian cities and Israeli settlements, as
unacceptable. Israeli military responses to three years of terror have
been quite effective, but sporadic attacks continue, and the costs of
protecting small and isolated settlements are unreasonable. In addition,
the multiple checkpoints, frequent closures and other sources of daily
friction between individual Palestinians and Israeli soldiers contribute
to the tension. And the political status quo poses a demographic threat
to the survival of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.

At the same time, the efforts to end this situation through negotiation
of a stable agreement, from Oslo to the Quartet's roadmap, have had
catastrophic results. Until there is a credible Palestinian leadership
to disarm the various factions and implement a lasting accord based on
the two-state model, negotiations are not going to end the conflict, and
may add to the violence. The evolution of a pragmatic Palestinian
leadership anchored in basic societal changes will take many years or
decades. Until then, Geneva and other paper concepts discussed under
Arafat's watchful eye simply lack credibility, and public relations
campaigns supported by the EU will not change this situation.

Under these conditions, unilateral disengagement has become the least
bad option, as many Israelis, including Sharon, now recognize. In the
absence of what academics and policy makers refer to as ""ripeness"", in
terms of broad societal readiness to make realistic compromises, Israel
needs to define pragmatic de facto borders. This logic led to the
intense public demand for construction of a separation
barrier/fence/wall, which has proven effective in protecting the
northern coastal cities such as Netanya and Hadera from terror attacks.

The construction of a separation barrier, and a clear, if
temporary, boundary, only makes sense with the reduction in the points of
friction and greater contiguity for the vast majority of both
Palestinians and Israelis. This means the removal of isolated
settlements near Palestinian cities, and strengthening of Israeli
control in strategic areas, including Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley,
to ensure border control. (This is not a peace plan, and political and
diplomatic issues related to the 1949 ceasefire line, the ""Green
Line"", are irrelevant.)

However, despite the logic and support from the Israeli consensus, the
implementation of this process will be difficult and costly. Sharon's
long-term core constituency anchored in Judea, Samaria and Gaza
denounced limited unilateral withdrawal as ""appeasement"", and violent
resistance is expected. If the issue is brought to a referendum, it is
likely to gain approval, but this could delay implementation, and force
some changes.

Opponents also argue that withdrawal from Gaza will be seen by
Palestinians as a victory, and, like the IDF's sudden pullout from
Lebanon in May 2000, will encourage more terror. However, others counter
that in the long term, Israeli security and deterrence were strengthened
by this move. Attacks are far less frequent and Hizbollah's power base
in Lebanon was weakened, as recognized by its backers in Damascus and
Teheran. Furthermore, many Palestinians, including Mahmoud Abbas (Abu
Mazen), have declared that the decision to copy Hizbollah's tactics of
terrorism was a disaster. Israel's unilateral withdrawal will give the
Palestinians far less than would have resulted from an agreement with
Ehud Barak four years ago, and efforts to use terms such as ""apartheid""
to demonize Israel via the UN and the International Court will not
change the situation.

In addition, for Israel's Arab citizens, separation means an end to the
unfettered access to the West Bank that they have enjoyed since 1967.
However, in contrast to the period between 1948 and 1967, when this
territory was under Jordanian occupation and the armistice lines were
impassable, the current policy of unilateral disengagement includes
mechanisms for regulated movement at numerous crossing points. Jordanian
fears of a mass movement of Palestinians resulting from disengagement
are also unsupported.

As a result of these and other factors, the implementation of unilateral
disengagement, whether under Sharon's leadership or a successor, will
face many challenges. But unless a better option appears that provides
security, reduces friction and ensures the survival of Israel as a
Jewish democratic state, the course is unlikely to change.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What is your opinion on Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon's plan to evacuate the Gaza Strip settlements?

A: First of all, we will not oppose the evacuation of any
settlement. Therefore, we see any evacuation as part of an Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian Territories. However, there is
a difference between leaving settlements and that having a positive
effect on the ground. We believe that Sharon is trying to kill the
roadmap which was adopted by the United States, the Quartet, and the
international community, and to implement an alternative plan in the
region which is from a purely Israeli perspective. This is part and
parcel with the Israeli plan of ""separation"" from the Palestinians; yet
another example of unilateral Israeli measures.

Sharon is trying to transform Gaza into a ghetto by evacuating some
settlements. Remember, the Sharon proposal goes for only 17 settlements
out of a total of 21 in the Gaza Strip. Therefore, the proposed
evacuations will have no political value since four settlements will
remain in the Strip. It is clear that these moves cannot be seen as a
political evacuation, but a security one. For Sharon proposes
""relocating"" some of the settlers from Gaza to settlements in the West
Bank. You can say he wants to leave through the door in Gaza and enter
through the window of the West Bank. It's just moving from one occupied
Palestinian land to another.

We feel that Sharon's plan is dangerous because he is trying to sidestep
both international legitimacy and the roadmap. These are attempts to
impose the status quo on the Palestinians by locking them within
enclaves, whether in the West Bank or in the Gaza Strip. By doing so, he
is sending the message that the Palestinians are a people who do not
deserve a state. These steps would abort the chances of creating a
Palestinian state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and will have many
dangerous repercussions.

Q: What sort of dangerous repercussions?

A: First, this would open the door to the continuation of
the brutal conflict between our two peoples for generations to come. It
is well known that there are different solutions to the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict. One is based on the two-state solution.
The second is based on one, bi-national state. The third is based on
conflict, the removal of one or the other people. The separation wall
precludes the creation of a viable and independent Palestinian state.
That leaves us with the two remaining possibilities and we know that
Sharon doesn't want a bi-national state. Therefore, this opens the door
to a conflict which will last for a very long time. This conflict will
also reinforce the ideology of the radical Islamic elements within
Palestinian society who also says that conflict and war are legitimate
solutions. Sharon is trying to force the Palestinians to choose the
option of conflict instead of choosing peace through the two-state
solution. This is very dangerous.

Q: Do you believe that the Palestinians Authority is
currently capable of taking control of the Gaza Strip?

A: Look, the situation in the Gaza Strip is very difficult.
Gaza is a ghetto, besieged and destroyed. We don't really have any
security services in Gaza. Some were completely destroyed, and what
remains are simply individuals or disconnected groupings, some of which
are contradictory. This obviously has negative repercussions on the
security situation in Gaza.

Q: Does the PA have complete control over Gaza?

A: From a professional perspective, no. The Palestinian
Authority does not have the means to control the entire Gaza Strip at
this time. This only reinforces the position of the Islamic groups
there. Israel bears responsibility for the destruction of the security
infrastructure in Gaza and for the deteriorating situation. I can say
that if the status quo is prolonged, there are many doubts if the PA can
assume responsibility for the Strip in the near future.

Q: So what are you doing to counterbalance the weakness
of the PA?

A: Right now we are relying on the Fatah Movement as the
alternative to the destroyed Palestinian security forces. Therefore the
situation is quite precarious. If the siege of Gaza is not lifted, and
the PA is not given the opportunity to impose its authority in an
effective manner, then I am pretty sure that Gaza will be transformed
from a ghetto into a jungle.

Q: Do you believe that an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza
will lead to the strengthening of Hamas since it sees itself as an
alternative to the PA?

A: I want to clearly state that we are in favor of Israel
withdrawing from any inch of occupied Palestinian territory. If we have
the choice of and Israeli presence or Hamas in Gaza, of course we would
choose Hamas or any other Palestinian faction. But this depends on the
way that Israel withdraws from Gaza and their aims. It depends on the PA
having the opportunity to assert its authority and Israeli cooperation
with the PA. If Israel withdraws in an abrupt fashion and without any
prior coordination with the PA, this will surely help Hamas. But it
appears that Sharon wants to destroy the PA and had no need for the
Palestinian Authority. He wants there to be civil strife which leads to
a civil war in Gaza. A withdrawal based on bad intentions and without
coordination with the PA will transform Gaza into a living hell.

Q: If you could address the Israeli public and policy
makers directly, what would you say to them?

A: I would tell them there is no alternative for the two
peoples other than the return to the negotiating table. There is no
choice but to live together peacefully on this land. We know that there
is no military solution because Israel has tried unsuccessfully with all
its weapons to crush the Palestinian people. They cannot force the
Palestinians to surrender. All these unilateral measures will fail in
the end. The Israeli people must take responsibility and put an end to
these policies aimed at humiliating and oppressing the Palestinian
people. Israelis must reject the imposition of any security solution to
the conflict and strive towards a fair and just political one for the
good of the coming generations. We both need a political resolution
based on the right of Palestinians to an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza with Jerusalem the capital of both states.
"
"Isr","Neut","The history of American foreign and defense policy since the beginning
of the twentieth century comprises dramatic shifts between phases of
intensive involvement in the international arena, and periods of
relative or complete disengagement from the outside world. The intense
involvement phase originates in a desire to reshape the external
environment on the basis of new premises; the disengagement phase is
characterized by the absence of any effort to influence developments
abroad, as in the period between the two world wars.

United States President Woodrow Wilson sought to build a new world order
on the basis of his ""Fourteen Points,"" and viewed American entry into
World War I as the necessary springboard for promoting his sweeping
political, ideological and territorial vision. But the administrations
which followed his presidency largely avoided such a sweeping definition
of the changes required in the domestic structure and modus operandi of
the national units comprising this system. At the outset of the Cold War
several American leaders, such as John Foster Dulles, who served as
secretary of state in President Dwight Eisenhower's administration
between 1953-1959, did occasionally allude to the need to roll the
Soviet empire back from Eastern Europe. But their actual policy was
largely rooted in the defensive premises of containment, deterrence and
coercion.

An examination of the first eight months of George W. Bush's tenure as
president indicates that they were predicated upon these traditional
principles of containment and deterrence. The Bush foreign and defense
policy elites were initially predisposed to pursue a unilateralist,
largely exclusionist posture. They sought to minimize the risk of
military entanglements in third-world areas, and instead to rely upon
the tools of deterrence and coercive diplomacy in confronting threats to
American security, including in the Iraqi context.

Indeed, during the period which preceded the September 11 attacks, the
neo-conservative belief that American foreign policy should be prepared,
in confronting national security threats, to take the initiative rather
than merely to react, and thus in the absence of broad international
support to unilaterally launch preventive strikes by using American
military hegemony to destroy the forces of international terrorism,
amounted to nothing more than an intellectual platform. Notwithstanding
the fact that the neo-conservative agenda came to increasingly permeate
and shape the thinking of policymakers like Deputy Secretary of Defense
Paul Wolfowitz and defense planners and analysts at the Pentagon during
the last decade, it was only in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 that
it was translated into an official and operational guide for action.

Thus by virtue of its magnitude and impact upon American strategic
thinking, the tragedy of September 11 can be viewed as a formative
traumatic event which precipitated a change in the traditional modus
operandi of American foreign policy. From the conservative pole of
defending the status quo that policy moved to the revisionist extreme of
seeking to transform the entire international system so that it would
conform with American ideas, values and institutions. The Iraqi campaign
was the first step in this direction.

It is against the backdrop of this sweeping neo-conservative doctrine
that the recent American preoccupation with the Palestinian issue, most
clearly manifested in the Sharm al-Sheikh and Aqaba summits, should be
viewed. This doctrine envisions a direct linkage between the Iraqi
campaign and the subsequent transformation in the structure of other
regional social and political systems. Thus it was only natural for
President Bush to look for regional windows of opportunity for progress
along the route toward the Wilsonian goal of democracy. It is at this
juncture that the roadmap                         of the Quartet,
combined with the election of Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) as the
Palestinian prime minister, became the main springboard for the
administration in its effort to translate its strategic and ideological
thinking into a new regional reality.

The president brought to this effort new leverage as an undisputed
hegemon. He had recently comprehensively demonstrated, in Iraq, his
readiness to use force to combat the threat inherent in rogue states and
in international terrorism, as the means of laying the groundwork for a
new--and democratic--regional environment. While his initial effort in
the Israeli-Palestinian context may appear successful in the immediate
aftermath of the Aqaba summit, this does not guarantee, of course, that
the roadmap will be smoothly implemented. With the parties still
separated by irreconcilable views concerning core issues, and with the
president about to become increasingly preoccupied with the requirements
of the 2004 presidential campaign, the road toward reconciliation may
still be long and rocky, particularly as the shadow of terrorism looms
as a constant threat to the entire process.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: As someone who has observed United States involvement
from the 1991 Madrid conference till now, how would you assess its role?

A: I don't really see any important change from Madrid to Aqaba,
despite that American policy under President George W. Bush has been far
less involved than that under the administrations of presidents Clinton
and Bush Sr. Perhaps over the last few weeks there has been some
activation of the American role, but we have yet to feel any progress on
the ground. To date, American policy from this administration still
supports the Israeli point of view accusing Palestinians of being
""terrorists"" and accusing this struggle against occupation of being
""terrorist"", all of which negates the United Nations charter giving
people under occupation the right to struggle against that occupation.

Despite the many years of occupation--now exceeding 36 years--there have
been no effective measures implementing United Nations Resolutions 338
                  , 242                    and 1397                    ,
as well as others related to the Palestinian problem. Indeed, we hope
that this new activity of the Americans will be translated into a real
vision on the ground and real progress in terms of pressuring the
Israeli government to take measures to end the military occupation of
the Palestinian territories, while first stopping Israeli aggression and
settlement activities in those territories.

Q: Can you name some positive contributions that the United
States has made in the history of the conflict?

A: During Madrid and after, there was hope among Palestinians
that the Americans would adopt an effective role. After President Bush's
initiative in 1991 and the measures he took against Mr. Shamir at that
time, we expected positive things. [Ed.'s note: George Bush Sr. withheld
US loan guarantees until Israel agreed in part to stop some settlement
construction.] We were also impressed by Mr. Clinton's active role and
active sharing in solving the problem by receiving Mr. Arafat in the
White House several times and visiting Palestine, but we were shocked
after Mr. Bush came to office. He denied Palestinians the right to their
elected president and banned President Arafat, thereby interfering with
internal Palestinian affairs.

This negatively affected the Palestinian people, who felt that the
Americans were following the lead of the Israelis--as if Palestinians
were occupying Israeli land. Frankly, there is now mistrust between the
Palestinian people and the American administration, but we hope that the
American administration will take steps to restore trust. There must be
good trust between the two sides.

Q: What was your opinion of Prime Minister Abbas' speech
                          in Aqaba?

A: The truth is that Mr. Abbas' statement was cause for
criticism from the Palestinian people. Bush asked each leader to state
his commitment towards the other side, but Mr. Sharon did not do this.
It seemed to our people that Mr. Abbas was being pressured by the
Americans and the Israelis, while Mr. Sharon was not. This was what made
our people angry with this speech.

Maybe they expected Mr. Abbas to give a strong statement similar to that
of Sharon                           , but because Mr. Abbas was
addressing the Americans, international opinion and Israeli opinion, he
forgot the opinion of his people. Sharon, on the other hand, first
addressed his people. But this imbalance in the statements demonstrates
once again that Mr. Abbas is sincere in his commitment to the roadmap
                       , while Mr. Sharon is not.

Q: Do you think that the roadmap has failed?

A: I can't say that, but I think it is in danger. I think Sharon
and his friends are not sincere, but that the Americans can still make
this roadmap succeed if they pressure the Israeli side. They have
convinced Mr. Abbas, and even though his statement made problems among
Palestinians, he remains committed to this process. Now the American
role is to pressure Sharon.
"
"Isr","Neut","The rule of law is a core need of every state. When most people living
in a state accept the rule of law, they generally live in peace with
each other; all except for the criminal fringe, who scorn the law, and
upon whom the state seeks to impose criminal law. When a state fails to
impose the rule of law on all groups and clans, including independent
armed organizations, the state veers toward chaos and pervasive human
misery.

Such for example, is the condition in several African states that over
the decades since independence failed to develop the rule of law. Such
is also the condition of Iraq, liberated from the rule of a cruel despot
yet unable to establish a state with the rule of law.

Such also is the tragic path onto which Yasser Arafat has led the
Palestinian people since his return after the Oslo agreements. Instead
of seeking to develop a state with the rule of law, a state in which
only state organizations carry weapons, he preferred to let existing
groups, including armed groups, act as they wish. Moreover he failed to
establish an independent judicial system, thus subjecting the courts of
justice to the whims of politicians. The result is that externally the
Palestinian Authority is fast losing international credibility as an
effective partner in the peace process, and internally there is
increasing chaos, as different organizations and clans use violence
against their opponents.

What about Israel? When Israel was established Prime Minister David Ben
Gurion said the rule of law was vital for the survival of the state.
After the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) was created he ordered the
dismantling of all other armed organizations, such as the Palmach, Etzel
(Irgun) and Lehi. From the start, the judicial system was independent
and since the first years of Israel it has made many key decisions that
were not necessarily in accord with the government line.

Tragically, the continued occupation of Palestinian territory by Israel
has gradually undermined the rule of law as a core Israeli value.
Primarily this happens in the occupied territories, where dozens of
settlements were established regardless of any law and where groups of
settlers use deliberate violence against the Palestinians and against
their property. Also the IDF, which is obliged to fight against
potential murderers of Jews, often kills, harms and humiliates many
innocent Palestinians, including women and children. Inside Israel, the
courts of justice still make independent decisions, such as the recent
High Court decision obliging the government to draw back parts of the
separation fence now being constructed. Nevertheless there is a
continued increase in the number of cases where the rule of law is
completely ignored, as in the growing number of illegal links between
capitalism and government.

This double tragedy between Israel and the Palestinians does not bode
well for peace. Without the effective rule of law on both sides, there
can be no effective peace process. And the absence of a peace process
will further undermine the rule of law on both sides.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: How serious do you feel the breakdown of law and order
we seem to be seeing around us is at the moment? 

A: I don't think this issue should be exaggerated. What has
happened so far was easy to contain, for the time being. I think what
happened was an alarm for the Palestinian Authority and Palestinians in
general to take care of a large number of accumulating problems. It was
a warning to people to turn their attention to tackling these problems
before they explode in our faces once again, perhaps in a more serious
way. 

But I would not suggest that Palestinian society is on the verge of
collapse. This is not the first time Palestinian society confronts this
type of problem. There is the continuation of the Israeli occupation,
military incursions and the siege, and despite all these problems,
Palestinian society has demonstrated a great deal of resilience. 

Q: You talk of this as a warning to the PA. A warning to
do what? 

A: It's a warning that unless we turn our attention to fix the
Palestinian order in its entirety, in terms of political, security,
administrative, and legal reform, we may face problems similar to the
ones that we have encountered recently, illustrated in the state of
lawlessness and certain violations of the rule of law, even political
violence, that resulted in confrontations and the burning of PA or
security institutions, etc. 

Q: Particularly from the international community you often
hear the demand that the PA should assert itself to set its house in
order. To what extent is this possible, while Israel continues its
military incursion and checkpoints, etc? 

A: The Israeli measures against the Palestinian people and the
Authority, and the siege on the Palestinian president, the restriction
of movement and the continued incursions and assassinations, make it
extremely difficult for people to focus on fixing their internal
situation. However, there are things that are within reach and that
could and should be done. Of course, nobody is demanding that the PA do
things beyond its means, we understand this and the reason we want to
fix our internal situation is because doing so will make the Palestinian
people more immune vis-a-vis the Israeli aggression and the state of
siege. 

Q: Do you feel there is any significance in the news that
the police will now be able to carry arms again? 

A: Well, the preliminary, modest and partial deployment of the
Palestinian police force is significant from the political,
psychological and security point of view, i.e., that the tools of law
and order are back in Palestinian cities and villages. This is a good
step, but I think the success of this depends very much on the Israelis,
whether they will allow this modest step to succeed or not, whether they
want to enable the Palestinian police to reassert itself, which also
means a reassertion of the PA. It won't succeed unless the Israelis are
serious in enabling them to undertake renewed responsibilities in
maintaining law and order in the Palestinian areas. 

Q: Isn't there a danger that the police will be seen as
Israeli proxies? 

A: I don't think so. They will not receive orders from the
Israelis. Of course the Israelis will impose a number of restrictions on
the mandate, movement and work of the police, but these men will be
receiving their orders from the Palestinian leadership. 

Q: You mentioned judicial reform. How important is this
and what exactly is needed? Are we talking about the ratification of the
constitution, or where are we going from here? 

A: I think the reason we are seeing all these problems is
because the separation of powers has not yet been established in the PA.
If there was separation of powers of the legislative, executive and
judiciary, and if there was independence of the judiciary, we wouldn't
have seen these kinds of problems. That's why judiciary reform is
necessary, to get a separation of powers and also in terms of having
specific job descriptions for the people who work in the judiciary. 

Q: And are you optimistic that such reform will take place
in the near future? 

A: I'm not sure. This has been a standing problem for a long
time and I have no reason to believe that it will be solved tomorrow. I
hope it will, but I'm kind of skeptical. 

Q: Yet you feel it is one the elements that need to be
solved in order to avoid a repeat of recent events? 

A: Well, this is the mechanism to take care of the state of law
and order and due process in our society. I think that without a
reformed, effective and independent judiciary nothing can be fixed in
the Palestinian situation and violations of the rule of law will
continue. So this is one of the main pillars in reforming the
Palestinian order.
"
"Isr","Neut","I have no doubts; it is just a question of time. Once again we shall see
delegations of Israel and the Palestinians sitting around the table and
renewing their negotiations. The two sides seek it, need it and are ripe
for it. I don't know when this will happen, but we have to prepare for
that day, now. We cannot permit the process that begins again to end
again in crisis and deadlock.

I see three obstacles that the two sides will have to overcome.

First and foremost--the establishment of a national leadership on both
sides that really and truly believes in the need to reach historic
compromise; compromise based on painful bilateral concessions;
courageous concessions, without which there can be no settlement. We are
all well aware of the parameters of the anticipated agreement. We can
call it the Clinton formula, the Camp David or the Taba agreements. The
problem is not the content of the agreement, but rather a leadership
that understands that there is no other way, a courageous leadership
capable of persuading its people, Israelis and Palestinians, to choose
this path.

The second obstacle is the practical expression of the painful
concession. A political agreement, once achieved, will oblige the
leadership to enforce its decisions among domestic opponents. We know
well who the opposition will be, who will try to sabotage and thwart
these decisions by force. We know the extremists in Israel and the
extremists among the Palestinians. Again, the two leaders and the two
leaderships will have to call upon both courage and strength to do their
duty.

The third obstacle is perhaps the most problematic of all. Both Israel
and the Palestinians will have to convince one another of the sincerity
of their intentions. They will have to remove the psychological barrier
of lack of confidence that has been there all along, and that has grown
and expanded particularly during the past two years of insane violence.

Twenty-five years ago we witnessed the dramatic visit of Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat to Jerusalem. In his historic speech in Jerusalem
he spoke of the fact that 70 percent of the conflict is the
psychological barrier between the two sides. ""My visit here, in
Jerusalem,"" he continued, ""has toppled that psychological wall!"" I
expect the Palestinians to persuade me, as Sadat did, of the sincerity
of their intentions.

But I am well aware that we bear the same obligation toward them.

I will begin with a move that echoes Sadat's visit to Jerusalem. As
prime minister of Israel I will invite whoever heads the Palestinian
political entity at the time, to come and address the Israeli people
from the podium of the Knesset. True, the words will be addressed to the
people of Israel, but this will also be a first class gesture to the
Palestinian masses. The Israeli prime minister's reply will present the
main points of his plan for immediate action, even before negotiations
have begun and before any agreements are reached.

Again, as prime minister of Israel I will convene a cabinet meeting that
will confirm ""the end of the Israeli occupation of the territories of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip."" I'll make sure the language of the
resolution speaks specifically of the ""West Bank"" and not ""Judea and
Samaria."" This will be accompanied by a second resolution, the complete
cessation of expansion of settlements in these areas, and an additional
gesture: the removal of all Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip.

Immediately thereafter, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) General Staff
will meet in the presence of the prime minister. At this meeting the
prime minister and minister of defense will issue a directive for the
immediate withdrawal of IDF forces from areas A and B, and transfer of
full responsibility for the needs of the population to Palestinian
hands. Orders will be issued to IDF forces to cease addressing the
Palestinian people as enemies. From that moment on, they will become
residents of a neighboring Arab country with whom we intend to live in
peace. And as a symbolic step, this meeting will also decide on
cancellation of the position of ""Coordinator of Government Operations in
the Administered Territories""' and transfer of all liaison and
coordination operations from the IDF to a special civilian authority
under the Prime Minister's Office.

An additional gesture: the unilateral, massive release of Palestinian
security prisoners.

Utopia, you say? Perhaps. But in the words of the father of the Zionist
movement, ""If you will it, it is not a dream!""
"
"Pal","Neut","The Middle East conflict has no shortage of international law to guide
its resolution. What is missing is really the political will of
governments to undertake their responsibilities according to their
mandate within the body of international law and international
humanitarian law. This absence of political will has kept Middle East
societies, particularly Palestinian society, lingering too long in a
situation of perpetual fear and conflict.

Palestinian society has yearned for too long for peace and security. We
have yearned to be able to move around freely without asking permission
from young gun-toting Israeli soldiers placed practically on our
doorsteps. We have yearned for the time when we do not have to worry
about our children going safely to school. We have yearned for too long
for the security of exercising our right to self-expression and
self-determination without being thrown in jail.

I can say, as a representative of Palestinian civil society and the
women's movement, that despite these handicaps and with international
support, we had come a long way in developing institutions to address
Palestinians' social needs for a future Palestinian state.

For example, the Palestinian women's movement had succeeded at making
inroads in addressing cultural values and attitudes particular to the
Arab world that handicap the healthy development of girls and women. We
Palestinian women were in the process of engaging ourselves in
legislative development locally and internationally. And we were
witnessing the development of a budding but vibrant young feminist
movement, an essential sector for democratic development within
Palestinian society.

But the last Israeli ""reoccupation"" of Palestinian controlled areas has
resulted in the systematic destruction of all that we have achieved over
the last ten years. The military onslaught was aimed at dashing any
hopes for a coherent Palestinian state and identity.

In the eyes of the average Palestinian, our society has been effectively
left at the mercy of a hostile state that continually violates with
impunity through the illegal and endless Israeli occupation almost every
law in the book regarding the behavior of states in armed conflict.
Having no effective Palestinian state to defend our interests, nor an
effective international third party to ensure the respect of the law,
desperate elements in Palestinian society have felt they have no choice
but to resort to their own means for self-defense.

Israel's continued violations of the laws of conflict have resulted in a
likewise violent and illegal response by Palestinian non-state actors.
This cycle of action and reaction has allowed the Israeli state in the
name of self-defense to use formal state military strategies and means
against none state actors and the communities they belong to as
collective punishment, leading the Palestinian community to feel that it
has nothing more to lose. Palestinians understand that the political
objectives of this military campaign are to break the Palestinian spirit
and force them to accept an agreement that is no agreement at all.

For the sake of preserving life, and in order to make political
negotiations possible, it is essential to create an environment of hope
by immediately sending international peacekeeping forces with a mandate
of protection. Any future negotiations must remain under international
auspices to ensure respect for international frameworks. The two
parties--Palestinian and Israeli--are not equal and should not be left
on their own. Otherwise, the process will be dictated by the imbalance
of power that characterized the Oslo negotiations, whose bloody
consequences we are now witnessing.

Peace is made between peoples and not between leaders. A process leading
to a sustainable and consequently permanent solution should be just, and
should not be left to the confines of the generals, and should be
transparent to the relevant societies.

We have to address and understand each other's history with open minds.
Our leaders have a responsibility to educate their societies about the
other as a matter of policy. If we leave things only to government
officials, we get Israeli generals and Palestinians who will not be
defeated, and there is no room to negotiate. Women's participation in
any future peace process is essential to maintaining the connection
between each society's realities and its yearnings for peace and security.

We cannot afford to waste any more time, or any more lives. We need to
think of a new approach. We as women want to bring a new understanding
to the situation in the Middle East. We want to approach peace building
in a way that will promote long-term stability. But we cannot do it
alone. We are asking for the help of the international community. Women
know instinctively that the use of force will never lead to peace,
justice or even security.

Despite all the disappointments and recent setbacks, it is important not
to give up on the region and, indeed, to capitalize on the strong need
and desire existing in both societies for security and stability. The
rule of law is essential for peace and harmony. We have to replace the
rule of force, which has governed our region for too long, with the rule
of law. This is the challenge before the international
community.
"
"Isr","Neut","Paradoxically, as in the Palestinian Authority's first elections in
January 1996, the current elections for the leader of the PA, held
exactly nine years later, generated little interest among the Israeli
public. This indifference must surprise outside observers; ostensibly,
Israelis should be paying greater attention to elections on the
Palestinian side. After all, not only will the elections determine who
leads the PA in the coming years--hence, whether it seeks peace or more
armed struggle; but well run elections can testify to the PA's capacity
to govern and to the deep roots sunk there by democracy in the
post-Arafat era.

Two key factors can apparently explain this seemingly strange
disinterest. The first derives from the attitude of the average Israeli
Jewish citizen to events on the Palestinian side in general, and the
second is linked specifically to the current elections.

In the old days, many Israeli boys and girls used to inscribe one
another's autograph books ""between you and me, a kilometer, between my
heart and yours, a millimeter"". The ties between the Israeli Jewish
public and the Palestinians are the reverse: the geographic distance is
small, while the emotional and cognitive distance is huge.
Metaphorically we might say that the wall of consciousness is much
higher and more impervious than the concrete and steel of the separation
fence.

The few small fissures in the wall of consciousness are usually opened
by negative events, particularly terrorist attacks. Immediately after a
traumatic mass attack there is a brief burst of Israeli interest in the
perpetrator, his/her environment and the operatives who dispatched
him/her. But as the shock passes, interest in what is happening ""across
the border"" dissipates too--interest that has practically ceased to
exist since the green line was effectively erased. Particularly
successful ""targeted killings"" or IDF attacks that take a heavy toll on
the Palestinian population also here and there generate a hurried
glance, mainly by the media, at what is happening on the other side.

But broadly speaking, the average Israeli Jew takes an interest in
events among the Palestinians only when they are linked to issues of
security. The majority doesn't know and is not interested in knowing the
facts about the Palestinian side or its feelings. Only a few Israeli
Jews can cite the names of PA administrators or Palestinian journalists,
authors, singers, businessmen or ""celebrities"", unless they have played
a prominent role in peace negotiations with Israel or, to the contrary,
are notorious for the perpetration of or support for terrorist activities.

Against this backdrop, no wonder the elections, too, were seen as an
""internal Palestinian affair"", particularly when informed analysis
indicated that the winner was known in advance and from the Israeli
standpoint he was the preferred choice.

In contrast to Yasser Arafat, who with a few short exceptions symbolized
for the vast majority of Jewish Israelis the ""bad Palestinian"", Abu
Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) is considered, justifiably or not, the ""good
Palestinian"". Both in a previous round, when he was appointed prime
minister through American and Israeli pressure with the objective of
carrying out ""reform"" that would weaken Arafat, and in his rise to the
senior leadership position following the death of the ""father"" of the
Palestinian nation, the prevalent view in Israel is that he is ""good for
the Jews"". The Israeli media covered his election campaign in a positive
manner, and usually highlighted those campaign themes that the Israeli
Jewish public could ""live with"". Even when Abu Mazen repeated almost
without exception Arafat's nationalist credo and vowed to honor his
legacy--including the establishment of the capital of Palestine in
Jerusalem and the refusal to renounce the right of return--the Israeli
public's ""take"" was that this represented little more than an electoral
strategy. It is not a substantive position that must be taken seriously,
nor should it be a source of concern in a way that Arafat's
uncompromising positions were understood (see the Steinmetz Center's
Peace Index for November 2004).

Further, since it was clear who the leading candidate was, the Israeli
leadership disseminated an ""everything will be fine"" atmosphere. This
helped generate disinterest among the public, which in any case is
preoccupied with the question of disengagement and its domestic
ramifications. Presumably, had the current elections taken place in the
context of assessments that a different candidate stood a chance of
winning, particularly one genuinely hostile toward Israel, say from
Hamas, then tensions would have risen on the Israeli side, together with
greater interest in the PA elections.

The fact that the identity of the winner was known in advance was also
grasped by Israelis as an indication that this was not a truly
democratic process, and that these elections did not constitute a
turning point in the authoritarian (some would add, corrupt) nature of
the Palestinian Authority. Hence the elections were seen more as the
inaugural ceremony for a perhaps anemic but quite friendly successor.
All that remains is to wait and see whether he acts as anticipated in
terms of establishing his authority over the organizations that are
hostile to Israel, and returning to the negotiating table.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: Do you think the elections have been successful? 

A: Yes, relatively speaking. They were relatively successful because
they were organized in a very short time, in less than 60 days, and most
of the procedures were respected in spite of the circumstances of
despair, poverty, and the difficulty in getting from one place to another.

Q: There are several ways of reading the numbers for these
elections. On the one hand, there is a clear majority for Abu Mazen, but
on the other it was a low turnout. How do you see this?

A: Whatever the analysis, I think Abu Mazen today has new
legitimacy. Still, my reading of the numbers is as follows: There are at
least 1.4 million eligible voters, so we are only talking about a bit
more than 50 percent of the voters who voted. This is despite the many
efforts by the Central Elections Commission to get people to register
and the money that was spent on this, and it is despite the fact that
while Hamas and Islamic Jihad asked for a boycott, they were not very
active in enforcing it. Look at Iraq. There, opposition to participation
in elections can be violent. This didn't happen here.

So, in other words, there is a large percentage of the population who
decided not to participate, or simply thought it was not worth it to
vote. This is an indication that some people are fed up with the system.
In certain places, like Rafah, only 42 percent of eligible voters voted.
I think this should give Abu Mazen pause to think about his success.

Q: How important was the boycott by the Islamist parties
and Hamas in particular?

A: My estimation is that between 45-50 percent of eligible
voters didn't participate. Now, how much of this is due to Hamas? I
don't think this is a signal of Hamas' strength, or that those who
didn't vote were all supporters of Hamas. In fact, mainly, I think, it
was people who were independent but who think that elections will not
bring change.

Q: So people didn't vote because they are simply unhappy
with the system. Can you elaborate?

A: People thought Abu Mazen would win, so some thought, 'why
bother'. Some think that while we have a prime minister and a
legislative council, it is all under occupation and with no real
authority and so these elections are just to mask the occupation, and we
shouldn't bother, we should act like an occupied people.

There are also people who think that none of the candidates represented
their ambitions or aspirations or issues. People are also not satisfied
with the whole performance of the PA during the ten years since Oslo.

Of course, we must also take into consideration that even in the most
developed democratic countries you don't have a hundred percent
participation.

So there are a number of factors. The refusal to participate is a
response from different sectors and from different reasons. But this is
not a success for Hamas. It is more a failure of the Palestinian
Authority rather than a success for Hamas.

Q: One of the mantras of all candidates was to stamp out
poverty and corruption, but there seemed little by way of detail about
how to do so. Did you feel the different candidates provided clear
political programs that distinguished each from the other?

A: Frankly, I don't think people discussed the different
political programs. There wasn't enough debate. In fact debate was
completely absent from the campaign. This is a particular concern to me.
This doesn't mean that people didn't look to Abu Mazen as someone who
could be backed by the US and Arab states and maybe bring some peace and
quiet, while others voted for Mustapha Barghouti as someone who
represents the future, a technocrat who will build a state with solid
institutions, etc.

But I don't think people were very interested in political programs.
Most of the time, when candidates distributed their political programs,
I observed that most would not read them, apart from the key words. So
it wasn't like in the 1970s or 1980s, where people related to a
well-defined political program and supported factions for that reason.

Fateh, for example, is the main political force in Palestine, in society
and the national movement. From what I've seen from my students, who
previously were very, very critical of Abu Mazen, the minute he was
chosen as the Fateh candidate, that was it. I think people voted because
this was their group or clan. In general, even since the beginning of
this intifada, there was never a real debate about issues. Even when
someone writes an article, it's very rare to see someone answer or
criticize him in a constructive way, unless it is personal.

On the other hand, we didn't see things we see in most of the third
world, like direct intimidation or dirty tricks, although there are
things I would like to have corrected. They decided to extend the vote
for another two hours, and, in addition, we have information that some
pressure was applied to members of the Central Elections Commission to
do so. Now, Abu Mazen's victory was of such a margin that it wouldn't
have affected the result, but I would like to see this issue
investigated and find some answers to what happened. We need to correct
such situations for the future.

In general, however, I would say we can be proud that we had democratic
and free elections.

Q: How do you assess Abu Mazen's popular mandate now?

A: Abu Mazen has strong legitimacy after these elections,
which can be added to the historic legitimacy of Fateh. I hope that the
strong minority, those who didn't vote, will respect the majority who voted.

Q: How confident are you that this will happen?

A: It depends on two things. First on how Abu Mazen will
proceed and secondly on how the Israelis will respond. If the Israelis
don't just push Abu Mazen into a civil war, I think he has many cards to
play.
"
"Isr","Neut","There is a direct connection between the approaching American offensive
in Iraq and the penetrating Egyptian diplomatic intervention in the
violent Israeli-Palestinian confrontation that began some 30 months ago.
Egypt has attempted to compel the Palestinian factions involved in
terrorism against Israel to cease their fire, unilaterally and without
any linkage with Israel's actions.

The architect of this Egyptian move is the director of General
Intelligence, General Omar Suleiman, who of course received the
blessings of President Mubarak. General Suleiman, one of the most
influential personalities on the Egyptian scene, presented Mubarak with
three primary reasons that obligate Egypt to intervene in the conflict
at this juncture. All are linked with the approaching war in the Gulf.

First, the United States is about to take action in the Gulf and Egypt,
as an ally, must help out at this time by calming down the
Israeli-Palestinian arena. Secondly, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
is liable to take advantage of the offensive in Iraq to step up military
activities against the Palestinians, thereby rendering a possible future
solution all the more difficult. And third, an Israeli-Palestinian
escalation during a war in Iraq is liable to have a negative effect on
Egypt and incite the ""street"" to demonstrate against the regime.

Initially Suleiman tried to engage Israel as well in his initiative. In
a meeting with Prime Minister Sharon, the Egyptian general asked for a
commitment that if the Palestinians ended terrorist attacks, Israel
would reciprocate by ceasing to attack Palestinian terrorist activists.
Israel's reply: first let them stop, afterwards we'll see.

Interestingly, even after Israel refused to commit itself, the Egyptians
decided to pursue their initiative unilaterally. They reasoned that if
the Palestinians do indeed cease their fire, Israel will not be able to
justify to world opinion its ongoing military activity for long, and
will be obliged to cease fire as well.

The Cairo talks took place in a civilian facility that belongs to
Egyptian Intelligence. In one of the first meetings involving
representatives of the main Palestinian factions, General Suleiman
demanded that they sign a commitment to a full and unconditional
ceasefire (hudna) in both the occupied territories and inside the Green
Line for an entire year. In corridor conversations, the Egyptians
signaled that they would suffice with half a year.

The Egyptians pressured Arafat vigorously before he approved the final
version, and invoked additional pressure to get him to permit Abu Maazen
(Mahmoud Abbas), a very senior leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, to go to Cairo as head of the Fateh delegation. Hamas,
which opposed the hudna idea from the start, fell back on a series of
delaying tactics in order to avoid confrontation with the Egyptians:
once the Hamas leadership sent a very junior representative rather than
sending a senior figure like Khaled Mashal, head of their Political
Bureau. And once they were absent from the meetings to protest the
Egyptians' failure to invite ""all the Palestinian organizations.""

The Egyptians spared no effort in bending Hamas to their will. Mubarak
addressed Syrian President Assad and asked that he pressure Hamas to
send Mashal to Cairo. General Suleiman informed the Hamas delegates
unequivocally that if they refused to sign, Cairo would from herein
consider them ""enemies of the peace process.""

But Hamas did not bend, and the Cairo talks were stuck. Last week the
participants disbanded without issuing a joint statement. They spoke
vaguely about continuing to meet at an unspecified later date.

Iran is to some extent responsible for the tough stance taken by Hamas.
But the main reason is the organization's perception that it currently
enjoys broad support on the Palestinian street for its demand to
continue the suicide bombings. This view was clearly reflected in
comments made at the end of last week by Mahmoud a-Zahar, a senior Hamas
official, to the effect that the organization is prepared in every way
to replace the Palestinian Authority as leader of the Palestinian people.

If the failure of the Cairo talks produced any benefit, it may lie in
the realization on the part of the moderate elements within Fateh that
Hamas' policy of ongoing terrorist attacks reflects not only that
group's permanent strategy against Israel, but also a means of gaining
the upper hand in the struggle for leadership of the Palestinian people.
A few attempts by Fateh operatives in the Gaza Strip in recent days to
confront Hamas and stop the firing of mortars and launching of Qasam
rockets against Israeli settlements may indicate that this awakening is
an ongoing affair.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What was your impression of the Cairo talks between the
Palestinian factions?

A: In general, they were positive because this is the first time for
many years that there have been frank and honest talks around the main
ideas--not just the usual matters, but the main positions of the various
factions. For example, discussion of the political lines and ideological
programs of the factions was significant and frank. It was the first
time that the groups discussed the duties and differences between them.
It was important, but not extensive enough, and there should be more
talks in the future.

During the dialogue, the continuation of the Israeli aggression against
the Palestinians and areas under Palestinian control (in the days of the
dialogue, there were repeated clashes) created an increasingly complex
atmosphere for the factions that were involved in the discussion and
study. Indeed, perhaps an indirect cause and major contributor to the
failure [of consensus] over some of the issues was the Israeli escalation.

Q: What were the major obstacles to an agreement?

A: The factional representatives that were there and the main
subjects in the dialogue concentrated on three subjects: transforming
the political vision of this intifada, transforming the tactics and
forms of the struggle with Israel, and third, transforming to a
Palestinian national unity government and fixing the Palestinian house
and our internal Palestinian relationships. These three subjects held
the greatest possibility of frank dialogue, like I said, and it may have
been possible to reach agreement over them.

Directly and indirectly, there was partial agreement on the issue of
targeting civilians, that civilians are not part of the strategy of the
Palestinian struggle. That was one of the most important things we were
discussing. Of course, there was no final agreement, but this remained
the most important issue and there was partial consensus that the
targeting of civilians is not part of the Palestinian strategy. The
Palestinians want to neutralize the issue of civilians, to remove them
from the struggle, and to make this a Palestinian and Israeli obligation
with international supervision.

Q: Did some of the discussion focus on pressure from outside
parties, such as from the Egyptians or Europeans?

A: No, there was no visible direct interference from the Egyptian
government, but there was situational pressure, let us say. This came
out of the complex circumstances facing the region; the chances of an
aggression against Iraq; American control of international affairs and
the strategic alliance between Israel and the United States regarding
all of the ongoing events in the Middle East region.

All of this put indirect pressure on the dialogue, not to mention the
official Arab position and the many difficulties in the Arab-Palestinian
relationship. The fact is that the European position is also influenced
by, or to a certain degree follows, the American position. Also, there
was concern expressed at the dialogue over the strength of the Israeli
right wing, and its racist policies. These were the situational
pressures, but there was no direct pressure [from governments].

Q: What do you think is the importance of unilateral moves
like this, from either the Israeli or Palestinian side?

A: Recently, there have been statements from the Israeli side
indicating that the Israelis want to plant in the Palestinian
consciousness that the resistance and the intifada cannot lead to a
political solution. Of course, we don't agree with this at all; the
Palestinian people want to continue with the intifada. And it is
important that they [Israel] understand that given their force and
control and given their destruction of the peace process, they are not
going to get their security. There needs to be a true renewal of the
peace process and discussion and internal change.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: At a time when Israel's military penetration into the Gaza
Strip is escalating and Abu Maazen is likely to be chosen prime minister
of the Palestinian Authority, are we in fact witnessing the victory of
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's strategy of scoring a decisive military
victory and forcing the Palestinians to change their leadership?

A: In the conditions of uncertainty that characterize the Middle
East, we cannot know what will happen in the long term, hence can deal
only with tactics. Therefore Sharon does not in fact have a strategy.
But we can credit him with the success of implanting the recognition
that the Palestinian leadership must be reformed. Clearly it never
crossed the mind of [Palestinian leader Yasir] Arafat that he needed to
appoint a prime minister; he has bowed to pressure. Our penetrations of
Gaza are also a tactic--to put a stop to the firing of Qassam
rockets--and not a strategy.

Q: You support a purely military solution to terrorism.
Sharon integrates a political element. Do you disagree with his path?

A: There is no possibility for substantive negotiations prior to the
suppression of terrorism. Sharon was late in implementing a military
solution. He should have begun following the Dolphinarium attack (summer
2001). In the beginning his steps were hesitant and he held that
""restraint is strength,"" but in general he is acting correctly now. It
was a matter of a learning curve in the face of a new kind of terrorism.

Q: There are disagreements between the Likud (and within the
Likud) and the National Religious Party and National Union, over
Sharon's peace policy and the objective of establishing a Palestinian
state. Under these circumstances can the new government succeed?

A: In my view the government is very stable. The law limiting the
possibility of raising no-confidence motions enhances stability, and
there is every likelihood that this government will last out its days.
As for disagreements, the important thing is the public's overwhelming
decision in favor of the Likud, which is unprecedented in Israeli
elections. Thus politically Sharon is in a very strong position
vis-a-vis past situations where the prime minister's party was a
minority within the government.

Clearly there is no unanimity within the government over the Palestinian
issue. But Sharon's long-term vision of a Palestinian state at the end
of the process is not worth much and I see little purpose in this talk.
The real challenge is terrorism, and on this issue the government is
united.

Q: According to the roadmap and President Bush's June 24,
2002 speech, a Palestinian state will be established before the end of
2003.

A: If Bush hopes that terrorism will end during 2003, so do I. But
I'm not certain this will happen. In the foreseeable future we will not
reach a crossroads of political decision, because in the Middle East
developments are very slow, painfully slow.

Q: In your view is the Sharon vision, according to which in
the second phase of the roadmap a Palestinian state will be established
without final borders in about 50 percent of the territory and for a
period of about 15 years, a viable vision?

A: It's difficult to deal with this issue; we're very far from such
a solution that ends the conflict.

Q: The Shinui Party does not embrace the political solution
of the Israeli right. Is it the weak link in this government? Will it
register sufficient ""secular"" achievements in a government in which not
a few oppose its line?

A: Shinui is a single-issue party and they will stick to this issue.
I don't see them leaving the government over an academic/hypothetical
issue. My advice to Shinui is: you won't have a better opportunity to
fulfill your single issue platform outside of this government.
"
"Pal","Neut","After negotiations that lasted through the nineties, we imagined that
Israelis and Palestinians were very close to signing a historic
agreement to end their struggle and open up the possibility for more
agreements with other Arab countries. At that time, most Palestinians
and Israelis believed that the negotiations had achieved approximately
95 percent of what they were supposed to accomplish, and that nothing
remained but to agree on a few select issues--albeit issues important to
each side.

Ariel Sharon, leading the opposition Likud party at the time of the Camp
David negotiations, did everything in his power to undermine those talks
and preclude an agreement that would end the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict. He achieved dazzling success and more. The Al Aqsa Intifada
flared and put an end to the peace negotiations. Then, in Sharon's first
government, he exploited the Labor Party to wipe out all of its
accomplishments towards peace with Palestinians. The West Bank was
completely reoccupied, already-weak Palestinian sovereignty was nearly
abrogated, and the Palestinian Authority was virtually destroyed.

Despite Sharon's extreme right-wing character, he now stands in his
newly formed second government at the far left of its members. This is
not because he has changed his views, but because the new government's
members are either just as right-wing and extremist as he is, or even
more so. In order to understand this government's position on peace, we
must refer to two extremely important documents: the coalition
guidelines and Sharon's December 4 speech at the Herzliya conference.
The coalition guidelines can be summarized as follows:

1. The government will work towards peace with the Palestinians and Arab
countries, on the condition that this does not harm the national,
historical and security interests of Israel and the Jewish people.

2. The government will work towards strengthening the position of
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

3. The government will work towards strengthening settlement
construction in all areas of the land of Israel.

4. Peace demands difficult concessions from all parties.

On the other hand, the primary idea in Sharon's Herzliya speech is that
of Palestinian statehood. According to that text, Sharon is prepared to
accept the establishment of a Palestinian state in stages. There can be
no progression to another stage until the previous stage is fully
implemented, and it is confirmed that Palestinians have fulfilled with
integrity and good intention all that is demanded of them.

To outline these stages, in the first, Palestinians must end the
Intifada and all acts of violence. The Palestinian Authority must
collect all weapons from Palestinian organizations and put an end to
incitement to violence in the Palestinian curriculum, among other
things. In the second stage, there must be fundamental reforms in the
Palestinian Authority, particularly regarding the powers and duties of
various governing institutions, as well as in the areas of finance and
security. There must be strong security cooperation between the
Authority and Israel. In the third stage, there must be Palestinian
elections. Only afterwards can a Palestinian state be established, and
then only in Areas A and B (areas of Palestinian control under signed
interim agreements). All external exits and airspace will remain under
Israeli control, assuming that the Israeli government coalition agrees
to this state project. In the subsequent stage, which is not defined by
a timeframe, negotiations will be held to end the Palestinian-Israeli
crisis once and for all.

For Palestinians, the proposals of Sharon and his government are not
serious at all, rather intended to give the appearance of supporting
peace and forcing Palestinians to reject these ideas so they appear the
spoilers. More than anything, the lack of seriousness comes through in
ideas so full of contradictions, stipulations and demands that they are
too vague to agree on, much less comply with.

How can there be a Palestinian state as long as settlement activity
continues? Is it reasonable to impose a system of governance and
administration upon the Palestinians, when doing so may be intended to
meet Israeli goals before Palestinian vital interests? How can
Palestinians meet Israeli demands if the Israeli government is the party
determining Palestinian compliance, and with the knowledge that this
government does not want to progress to the next stage?

The government's guidelines stipulate agreement on a Palestinian state,
at the same time that the right wing parties are loudly announcing in
the media that they will not agree to a Palestinian state west of the
Jordan river. In only one example, the National Union party headed by
Avigdor Lieberman has stated repeatedly that it ""opposes the
establishment of a Palestinian state west of the Jordan river no matter
what its borders.""

Even stranger is that the leaders of this government opposed the Oslo
accords, did everything to invalidate them, and succeeded to a large
degree. Now they are proposing a peace between the two sides that has
many of the same characteristics of the Oslo accords. Is their intention
simply to change the accords in name, since the old name is connected to
the Labor Party and President Yasser Arafat? Or is the goal to start
over and stall, imposing new facts on the ground that will preclude the
establishment of a Palestinian state?

Following World War II, the most extensive war in the history of
mankind, there were hundreds of peace settlements and agreements signed
in the short period of two years. By contrast, Israel has imposed on
Palestinians negotiations now lasting over a decade that have still not
solved the problem of a piece of land one millionth of the global land
mass that participated in World War II. On the contrary, Sharon and his
government have returned the problem to square one and ignored the last
decade of talks. Here one must ask--how much time do the two sides need
to negotiate before the conflict is finally put to an end?

I believe that the fundamental flaw in the Oslo accords was the
principle of a stage-based solution to the conflict. The waiting factor
and fear produced by very slow talks have increased the anxiety of both
Palestinians and Israelis. The arena has been opened up to those who
oppose any settlement at all, placing both Israeli and Palestinian
societies in a position of anticipation, tension and apprehension, as
they interpret any act of violence as dissolving the glimmer of change
ahead.

What is strange is that Israeli and American politicians have apparently
not learned the lessons of Oslo, as it seems that they are soon to
repeat the same mistakes. In my view, the solution to the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict will ultimately cause sharp pain to both
peoples, just as labor pains or a toothache cause brief severe pain
before the body returns to normal. This conflict must be dealt with in
one blow, because a stage-based solution means continuous agony for
months and years on end.

Most of the members of the current Israeli government don't want to
begin peace negotiations before teaching Palestinians a lesson they
won't forget, so they don't return again to revolution and Intifada. But
the Israeli leaders must remember that Israel has crushed Palestinians
many times in the past and yet they always returned quickly to
revolution. This doesn't mean that the Palestinians are stupid or slow
to understand, it is simply that the great injustice done to them in
1948 far outweighs the pain of revolution.

I believe that every few years, the Palestinian people will return to
revolution and Intifada--just as they always have--as long as their
cause is not handled justly and humanely. What will Sharon's new
government accomplish if the Palestinian people--who now make up half
the population of Mandatory Palestine--quiet down? Will they disappear
from the face of the earth, or will they force future Israeli
governments to accept a democratic bi-national state? Isn't this the
solution that Palestinians have advocated for decades, one Israel
rejects out of hand to this day?
"
"Isr","Neut","In order to whip up hatred for the settlers among the rest of Israel's
citizens, one of the areas where the left wing organizations have
focused their propaganda is the budgetary allotments invested in the
settlements instead of in the development towns. The recent terror war
witnessed the addition of a cruel, consensus-breaking propaganda
dimension: not only was money being wasted there, but blood was too.
Since the proportion of development town youth among the combat units is
growing, the development towns are paying not only the economic cost of
the settlements, but a cost in human lives as well.

Then came the Likud referendum and delivered a crushing blow not only to
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, but to all those who would sow dissent
between the settlers and the rest of the Israeli people, and especially
the development town dwellers. More than 70 percent of Likud members
from the development towns (compared with ""only"" 60 percent of the
total) voted against uprooting the Katif Bloc settlements. In other
words, they voted by a large majority in favor of continuing to invest
in the settlements instead of in development towns.

When the prime minister first conceived the disengagement plan he
assessed, in accordance with the atmosphere generated among the public
by the media, that Israelis opposed the settlers, were alienated from
their motives and were no longer prepared to sacrifice their blood and
their money for them. This, then, was the appropriate time for a
settlement removal plan. After all, it enjoyed widespread public support.

Indeed, during the early weeks of the disengagement plan Sharon's
concept appeared to be valid: at one point the polls showed that about
72 percent of Likud members supported it. But then, rather than giving
up, the Katif Bloc settlers decided to visit the homes of the Likud
Party faithful. They were quickly joined by volunteers from Judea and
Samaria; every settlement took responsibility for a voting region.

My settlement, Ofra, took on a tough Likud area, Holon, a lower-middle
class town near Tel Aviv. There, we were told, live a lot of ""new""
Likudniks who have no ideological sentiments. Polls showed that more
than 75 percent supported Ariel Sharon. In the course of my house visits
I indeed encountered few people who had links from the past with the
historic Herut movement (which spawned today's Likud), one of whose key
principles was the sanctity of Greater Israel. Most hold ""centrist""
views that are characteristic of Shinui voters or the mainstream of the
Labor Party. The vast majority had never visited a settlement, and few
had ever met a settler face-to-face. Nearly everything they knew about
the settlers was negative and was drawn from the media. The outcome in
Holon: 54 percent voted against uprooting the settlements.

The results show that the house visits staged by the settlers (around 50
percent of the registered Likud members who voted received a house
visit) generated among the Likudniks a cognitive shock. Nothing else can
explain the revolutionary transition from over 70 percent support for
Sharon around two weeks before the referendum to 60 percent opposition
to Sharon in the final count. Approximately 50 percent of registered
Likudniks changed their minds. The voters discovered--and I heard this
with my own ears--that their encounter with the settlers revealed a
totally different type of person than the monstrous image painted by the
media.

Based on this analysis of the ""non-ideological"" Likud voter--who
resembles, as noted, that of Shinui and the Labor mainstream--we can
assume that, were Sharon to be tempted in the near future, as he has
declared, to reveal a ""different"" plan and bring it to a national
referendum (he lacks a Knesset majority for holding a referendum, but
let's assume he has one), the results among the Jewish voters would be
similar. Because the settlers can be depended on to pay the voters
personal visits yet again. And no government in Israel, even one headed
by Yossi Beilin, can uproot settlements, even if it achieves a majority
in a referendum, without a Jewish majority.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What was Gaza residents' impression of Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon's ""unilateral disengagement plan"" prior to his
party's vote against it?

A: The moment Sharon presented his unilateral disengagement
plan, all types of Palestinians on all levels, political and public,
began to think about the expected withdrawal and to prepare their
future, believing that if the settlements were evacuated and if the
Israeli army pulled out, then their lives would be much easier than they
are now.

They were dreaming, and unfortunately Sharon and the Likud party made
this dream a nightmare. The suffering of the people in Gaza is mounting
day after day, with the building of a new barrier in the central Gaza
Strip that cuts the Gaza Strip into two near the junction of Kissufim
(what the Palestinians call Abu Holi), the junction leading to the
Jewish settlement compound of Gush Katif. What has made Palestinian life
even harder beyond the previous measures of closure imposed on the Gaza
Strip for more than three years is that people are currently unable to
travel abroad. Israel has issued a new security order saying that
Palestinians aged 16 to 35 cannot leave the Gaza Strip ""for security
reasons."" Also, it has shut down the Erez crossing in the northern Gaza
Strip. All of these difficulties intensified after Ariel Sharon began to
talk about his unilateral disengagement plan.

Q: What was the reaction of the Gaza political leadership?

A: All factions, including Fateh, the largest faction in the
Palestine Liberation Organization, and Palestinian Authority officials,
agreed that they should be united in the event of an Israeli army
pullout and evacuation of the settlements. For example, before Ahmad
Yassin, the spiritual leader and founder of Hamas, and his successor Dr.
Abdel Aziz Rantisi were assassinated by Israel, Hamas accepted the plan
in principle and began to prepare the ground for post-pullout and
evacuation.

You might say it was like waiting for Godot. But Sharon used his plan
only to gain more political achievements for himself, his party and the
state of Israel.

Q: Exactly what kind of agreement were the factions trying
to reach?

A: The factions began to change their strategies and change
their ideologies, in fact. They wanted to disprove what the Israeli
media was saying, which was that Hamas and Islamic Jihad would take over
the Jewish settlements that were to be evacuated in the Gaza Strip.
Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders were announcing in the media that they
did not seek to take control of the Jewish settlements, that they were
not greedy, but that we [Palestinians] should all be united in governing
and controlling Gaza. But everything was turned upside down, two leaders
of Hamas were assassinated, and all of the movements, Islamic and
national, are currently in a state of depression and disappointment.

Q: But would the factions have succeeded in creating a
unified position?

A: If Sharon was serious about implementing his plan as soon
as possible, they would immediately renew their dialogue. In fact, Hamas
itself announced many times that in the event of a pullout from the Gaza
Strip, it would have no objections to join in the Palestinian Authority,
to be part of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee.
Letters were exchanged between Khaled Mashaal in Damascus and Yasser
Arafat in Ramallah. Those letters spoke of Hamas' acceptance to join the
PLO after an Israeli army pullout from Gaza.

Q: Does the Likud vote mean the end of the plan?

A: Many Palestinians believe that Sharon was never really
serious. He knew in advance that the Likud party, with its great
influence on the Israeli government, would oppose it completely. He made
use of this plan to gain more achievements and get financial aid from
the United States.

This is the first time in the history of the Palestinian question that
the United States president has legalized Jewish settlements built on
Palestinian property in the West Bank. This is the first time that any
US president has spoken of canceling the right of return for Palestinian
refugees. He said that any Palestinian refugee who wants to return,
should return to the Palestinian state. Which Palestinian state is
George Bush talking about? The state of Gaza? Gaza already has 1.5
million people and would never be able to absorb another half a million
Palestinian refugees. They would never accept to return to Gaza.

Sharon wanted the number one man in the world to cancel the right of
return of the refugees. He cancelled Security Council resolutions that
gave Palestinians the right of return, the right to establish a
Palestinian state and the right to struggle against the occupation. That
was the aim of presenting such a false unilateral plan.

Q: In the short term, then, what do you think will happen?

A: The intifada is going to continue. Attacks will be
resumed against Israel. But the thing that worries Palestinians and
President Arafat personally is that the price of any suicide bombing
attack carried out by any Palestinian faction inside Israel will be
Yasser Arafat--either his head or his deportation to Gaza, what Israelis
refer to as the ""big garbage can of the Gaza Strip."" I believe that all
factions are united on this point [and are acting to prevent this].

Q: Doesn't the lack of response weaken Hamas?

A: Hamas leaders admitted that the assassination of Yassin
and Rantisi severely weakened the movement. But this might also be a
tactic. First, Hamas does not want the price [of its revenge] to be
Yasser Arafat because it needs him at this particular time. Second, a
Hamas leader released a few days ago from an Israeli jail was saying
that Hamas is planning a big earth-shattering attack to avenge the
deaths of Yassin and Rantisi and other Palestinians. In other words,
Hamas is only waiting for the right time.
"
"Isr","Neut","The broad, one might say sweeping, movement for building a separation
fence, ""tens of meters high, so that I won't ever see them again,"" in
the words of one interviewee on Israel national television, last week
even co-opted the institution that by all ideological and political
logic should have been the most aggressive and most vocal opponent of
separation: the settlement movement. In an Israel Radio broadcast on
June 6, 2002--the day Israel conquered, 35 years ago, northern Samaria
where Benzi Lieberman, the Chairman of the Council of Settlers in Judea,
Samaria and Gaza [known by it acronym, ""Yesha Council""],
lives--Lieberman announced that the Council, the premier institution of
the settlers, would not oppose (any longer) the construction of a fence
that will separate the State of Israel from the body of settlements to
the east, including Jewish settlements.

Is this the policy of the Yesha Council? Do the settlers whom Lieberman
represents really want to be separated from the rest of the Jews inside
Israel? Don't they understand that separation begins as a functional
act, then becomes conscious separation, wherein the settlements of
Samaria and Judea are seen as a separate entity in all senses of the
word, and ultimately renders it easier to enact political separation?
The Yesha Council's acquiescence in a separation fence reflects--even
more than the acquiescence of politicians who ostensibly have to satisfy
public opinion--the mental state that has gripped the vast majority of
Israelis for some 21 months since Chairman Yasir Arafat initiated a
terror war that has succeeded in wearing them down. The Yesha Council,
seeking somehow to bridge the disconnect that divides it from most of
the frightened public (some of whom actually believe that vicious
terrorist attacks are being carried out because of the settlements),
feels obliged to cease swimming against the current. And ""if the mighty
have succumbed, how shall the weak emerge unscathed?""

The first Israelis to demand the construction of a fence for physical
separation, as high and thick as possible, between Israel and the
Palestinians, were paradoxically the heads of the Labor Party, men and
women of peace; they who signed the Oslo agreement with Yasir Arafat,
which was supposed to put an end to all the bloodshed and render any
physical barrier superfluous. And after Haim Ramon, Ephraim Sneh and
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, minister of defense and head of the Labor Party,
came the Likud ministers too. Surprisingly, these include Minister of
Internal Security Uzi Landau, an adherent of the Greater Land of Israel.
Finally, as public pressure built up, they were joined by Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon.

This is indeed astonishing: Sharon, in character, substance, military
practice and even political inclination, takes the offensive. He has
always sought to decide a conflict by attacking and overwhelming.
Defensive trench warfare, he used to say, is costly in both human and
budgetary terms. In particular, the defending side never wins. It is the
initiator, who enjoys mobility, who always has the advantage. During the
War of Attrition launched by Egypt in 1968 Sharon opposed construction
of the Bar Lev Line of fortified emplacements along the Suez Canal. When
the line eventually collapsed in 1973 Sharon took his detractors to task
very pointedly. Yet here he is in the position of supreme decisionmaker,
altering the concept he held his entire life. He has accepted--perhaps
surrendered to--the completely pessimistic mood sweeping Israeli public
opinion.

He knows what the results of the separation fence will be: the de facto
determination of the border between Israel and the Palestinian state
along the Green Line, without Arafat even ceasing his terrorism. And if
Arafat achieves this prize of the Green Line without a ceasefire, why
should he stop the violence afterwards, since the Jews have demonstrated
to him that [Hizballah leader] Nasrallah's spider web formula works,
despite the achievements of Operation Defensive Shield.

The Bar Lev Line along the banks of the Suez Canal was constructed
hundreds of kilometers from Israeli population centers. The ""Sharon
Line"" is being built by Ariel Sharon within rifle and machine gun
distance from Israeli cities and villages like Kfar Sava and Kochav
Yair, where hundreds of thousands of Israelis live. Judging by its
sweeping support for a separation fence (over 80 percent), Israel has
despaired, at least for the foreseeable future, of achieving any kind of
agreement with the Palestinians. Accordingly the terrorist attacks among
the Jewish population of Israel and the settlements, especially the
suicide attacks, will not cease. And the settlers, following Ariel
Sharon, are lending their support to a step that will not bring peace
and, certainly in the long term, will not bring security, and which
demonstrates to the Arabs, like after our flight from Lebanon, that
terrorism pays. And how it pays!
"
"Pal","Neut","Israeli officials are reported to debate extensively the best possible
plans for securing their citizens and boundaries. The media covers these
discussions, including the daily incursions into Palestinian towns and
cities, the time period and intensity of force needed. Usually, we are
told, the controversy is over whether to occupy all or part of the
territory, ""isolate"" or remove Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, as well
as how to create the conditions needed for negotiation.

There is no controversy, however, that puts a dent in the nearly
unanimous feeling of Israelis that the reason for these military actions
is to defend both Israel and the Israeli people. While some individual
""mistakes"" are acknowledged here and there, the majority of Israeli
officials continue to dodge the questions ""where are the lands of
Israel?"" and ""what are Israelis doing in the occupied territories?""

Under cover of these discussions, the Israeli government has initiated
the first steps in creating an isolation wall. Thousands of dunums of
land are being expropriated from Palestinians for that purpose and the
final plans are to be completed within 24 months. After that time
period, Palestinians will be living in their own ghettos, unable to
leave and only partially accessible. According to these plans, it
appears that the current government in Israel would redefine the
boundaries of the state to be everything outside and around Palestinian
cantons. These cantons will only be allowed vital needs. Should the
Palestinians then declare these cantons their state or empire will then
prove irrelevant.

There are some crucial steps that must be taken in order to facilitate
widespread acceptance of this final resolution. These steps, already
begun, include the subjecting of Palestinians to a system of closures
and permits to move that are unprecedented, even when compared to those
of former South Africa. The result is to make the daily lives of
Palestinians an inexhaustible source of ordeal and uncertainty.

Following are some excerpted affidavits collected from Palestinians:

* ...I am the father of Aya, 12 years old, and Hanin, 10. Both have
Thalassemia and require blood transfusions at Ramallah Hospital at least
once a month. For the past month, even the alternative dirt roads have
been blocked, not even ambulances are allowed to reach the nearest
checkpoint...I do not know what to do... (Amin Masoud from Der Ammar
village, usually a 20-minute drive from Ramallah)

* Samar Tawfiq, 31 years old...Had bleeding in her ninth month of
pregnancy. Was delayed for more than four hours before finally reaching
Rafidia Hospital. The woman's life was saved but the baby died... (from
Beit Furik Village, seven kilometers from Rafidia Hospital in Nablus)

* ...My father had earlier in the day tried to take my sister Aisha, who
suffers from renal failure, to Ramallah Hospital. She is required to
undergo dialysis three times a week. His efforts to talk to the soldiers
at the checkpoint proved futile. They even started shooting...later that
afternoon, as her condition deteriorated, I tried to take her out again
using a different route, but the soldiers would not allow us anywhere
near them...An ambulance was also unable to come to the checkpoint...we
had to go back and later that evening, my sister died... (Amjad Ali, the
brother of Aisha Ali from the village of Qibya, normally a 20 minute
drive from Ramallah)

These are only excerpts from only a few sample cases collected by
lawyers and field workers at the Jerusalem Legal Aid Center--only one
Palestinian human rights group. They were collected in the hopes that
these voices would be heard and that the United Nations Secretary
General or High Commissioner might find time or courage to speak up
against these acts that can only be termed ""crimes of war."" They were
collected in the hope that signatories to the UN Charter remember what
that Charter was all about. In the hope that all this might have an end.

Unfortunately, these cases are those of the common people. No statistics
count them and their daily lives are on no one's priority list. These
are the people that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon says must be
thoroughly beaten before they accept their fate.

When human rights groups have petitioned representatives of the world's
""most humane army"" on behalf of Palestinians with illnesses who must get
past Sharon's walls, the army responded that these people can apply for
travel permits from Bet El military administration center near Ramallah.
But if these people cannot even get to the next town, how then can they
apply at Beit El?

More cynical yet are official responses to complaints that the army is
preventing medical aid or movement in contravention with the Fourth
Geneva Convention or humanitarian law. The army has responded that this
situation is a result of Palestinian violence and, therefore, that the
referenced conventions do not apply due to the nature of the armed
conflict. It is as if the Geneva Convention was intended to apply in
times of peace rather than in war!

All of these fences are not aimed at protecting the Israeli citizen, but
rather fulfilling the ingenious criminal fantasies of Prime Minister
Sharon. They have not succeeded in foiling even one suicide bombing, but
provide motive and the desire for revenge for hundreds more.

As this policy continues, beyond the fence will lie more than three
million Palestinians held captive in the newest racial segregation
system in the world.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: What is the Shinui Party's new peace plan?

A: We think that we should do something about the peace process,
and our initiative is to encourage Palestinian moderates, including Abu
Alaa, the new prime minister, by proposing a ceasefire and, after a
period of quiet, evacuating the settlement of Netzarim and leaving it as
a military base, then evacuating the military, and by releasing some
prisoners, removing the siege on many Palestinian cities, enabling some
Palestinians to enter Israel, and starting new joint economic ventures.

Q: Some reports indicate you want to change the location of
the security fence.

A: We know the Palestinians don't like the fence. The aim is to
prevent terrorists from getting into Israel. We're flexible on the
location, for example it should not go around Ariel, but be more or less
parallel with the green line. But we know that if we start to discuss
the location with the Likud, in the end we'll have no fence.

Q: Can Shinui lead this government to a new peace initiative?

A: Our agreement with the Likud is based on the roadmap
                        and Prime Minister Sharon's Herzlia speech
                   , according to which in the end there will be a
Palestinian state. But we know that within the government there are two
parties that oppose a Palestinian state, and we know that even some
Likud ministers are actually more to the right than we would like. We
are the moderate part of the government, trying to move toward concessions.

Q: How do you understand Sharon's strategy on the
Palestinian issue?

A: It's difficult to judge Sharon and to describe his real
feelings. We do know now that unfortunately we have no Palestinian
partner. During my period in the government we've seen that the
Palestinian Authority is not serious about security. Abu Mazen [Prime
Minister Mahmoud Abbas] had to resign, and the chances for progress are
slim. If we have a partner, I believe the Sharon government will move
with it. Sharon has stated he would, and there's a lot of pressure from
the US and the EU. I want to believe that in the end he would like to
have an arrangement with the Palestinians. In addition the economy is a
main factor. Hotels are empty and investors aren't coming because of the
political situation. So the government has an interest in peace.

Q: Do you see any likelihood of a coalition switch--Labor
replacing the two right wing parties?

A: It's hard to say. A big mistake was made by Labor under Mitzna
in refusing to join a national unity government. Now this does not seem
relevant, and unfortunately Labor does not have a leader. But if a peace
process starts and Israel is asked for concessions, then the National
Religious Party and National Union might leave and Labor could be asked
to join.

Q: You voted against yesterday's cabinet decision to carry
out a prisoner swap with Hizballah that includes hundreds of Palestinian
prisoners. How do you think such a swap will affect the Palestinian issue?

A: I think that if we look at the Arab world we see, on the one
hand, the extremists, Islamists, headed by Iran, including Hizballah and
Hamas and Islamic Jihad, down to the Israeli Islamic movements.
Releasing 400 prisoners to Hizballah is a sign that Israel understands
only force. It strengthens the extremists.

Q: Do you think the new Palestinian government under Abu
Alaa (Ahmed Qurei) can renew the peace dynamic?

A: Not really. We wanted to believe that Arafat had become ""passe""
and would accept the role of honorary president and give power to a
prime minister. Now we hear that the security forces will still be
controlled by Arafat and he is not taking the necessary steps against
terrorists. I think some negotiations will begin with Abu Alaa if he's
ready, but negotiations by themselves are not the goal, we need results.
If the Palestinians are able to stop terror in some way, then the
process can go on. The Israeli government will not say no to a ceasefire
if it's voluntary.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What will be the political program of this Palestinian
cabinet?

A: The ministers' first tasks are establishing a policy to
confront the segregation wall, the settlements and the Judaization of
Jerusalem. Then they must make reforms to get to the point of
presidential, Legislative Council and municipal elections as soon as
possible, and to continue as much as possible with determining a
development policy, despite occupation conditions.

Q: How do you intend to respond to the separation wall?

A: A new strategy must be established in order to expose this
Israeli settlement policy and to enlist the world and the Arabs to
pressure Israel to put a stop to the wall. It must occupy a broad space
in the media and in popular activities, as well as support the citizens
living in the wall region and those who have been recently harmed by it.

Q: What will be the difference between this government and
its predecessor headed by Mahmoud Abbas?

A: In program, there are no significant differences. The
difference is perhaps over the issue of the interior [minister] that has
been resolved by keeping security in the hands of the Higher Security
Council, which is headed by the president and represents all the leading
factions. This is a new formula and perhaps handling the issue [of
security] will be easier when the president himself is in the picture.

Q: Do you believe that the Legislative Council will approve
the cabinet selections?

A: Nothing is guaranteed. The Legislative Council may approve
it--or may not. If there is broad participation, the government will
attain the council's vote of confidence. If there are comments [to be
made] on the government program and budgeting issues for next year--but I
must remind you that recently the atmosphere has been one that assists
the government in gaining a vote of confidence.

Q: How will the government handle the issue of security in
light of American pressure?

Q: I think that there is an exaggeration of the issue of
security that originates outside and is imposed on the Palestinian
street. Israel is disseminating this [view] and the United States and
the international community have adopted it in an attempt to focus first
on security.

However, the first problem is not security, but the existence of
occupation. There are no policies [at work] that offer Palestinians the
hope of a political solution. I believe Palestinians are ready to
compromise and to honor the agreements and provide the security demanded
of them. However, if we go back to the old-new story of ""security
first"", then we must determine whether one has done enough concerning
security--only then will [Israel] think of easing measures and
reconsider the wall and the settlements.

This standard has proven to fail; it will not succeed today or tomorrow.
If security is not joined to the political issues and with restoring an
obvious political track that gives Palestinians guarantees for escaping
the suffering they live in, nothing in the security arena will change
and no Palestinian government will be able to change it, because this is
something that we do not control.

How can they [Israel] demand security from us, when they invade Jenin
and Rafah daily? If they were to halt their aggression and withdraw from
the cities and reconsidered the security issue, then the Palestinians
would have something to protect in the [resulting] relative sovereignty
of the Palestinian population. The experience of Bethlehem is an
example: since the Israeli withdrawal, not one security incident has
occurred. This is proof that if Israel were to withdraw from the West
Bank and Gaza, stop killing Palestinians, and [stop] its aggressive
policies, the Palestinian Authority would be able to preserve security.

Q: When does the Palestinian Authority become unfeasible as
an agent of the two-state solution in light of the Israeli settlement
policy?

A: The potential [for independence] lives on in the Palestinian
people on their land, and thus they maintain the international
legitimacy for self-determination with which to establish their state
and acquire sovereignty and independence once the occupation is removed.
The Israelis will not attain normal economic and security conditions
until they deal with the Palestinian issue in seriousness. This is what
we rely on as we search for new people who believe in peace to come to
power in Israel, those who believe in returning to the June 4 borders
and granting Palestinians a state in order to achieve peace and
security. There is still hope.

Q: What are your expectations for the future?

A: As long as the occupation and the aggression against our
people goes on, there will be uprisings from our side against this
occupation, and resistance in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. There will
be undesired retaliations. The last operation in Haifa (which we were
opposed to) initiated in Jenin, which has been occupied for more than a
year and a half. No one can throw the responsibility for security at the
Palestinians, since it doesn't reside there.

Q: There seem to be some new faces among the ministers
representing Fateh on the cabinet.

A: If a referendum were to be carried out in the Palestinian
street, the vacuum to be filled by new faces [in the cabinet] would be
wide. The current change, in fact, is small. I would not call this a
generational struggle, but a natural process of regeneration. To resolve
this internal issue, we must return to holding movement conferences and
conduct an election in the bodies of Fateh to elect [new] leadership or
reelect the current leadership. Democracy and elections would revive
this movement.
"
"Isr","Neut","The past two weeks have been the most violent since early 1996, and
marked what may be the final phase in the disintegration of the Oslo
process. The suicide bombings and other terror attacks in Israeli cities
came a few days after the new American peace initiative that that been
demanded by the Palestinians and their supporters in the region. The
wave of terror attacks coincided with the beginning of United States
envoy Anthony Zinni's mission to implement earlier ceasefire agreements,
and posed a direct challenge to the Sharon government and to the Bush
administration.

These attacks triggered a fundamental change in the balance of political
forces. Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasir Arafat's
strategy since September 2000 has been to use violence to press Israeli
leaders into responding with ""excessive force,"" in order to justify
international intervention and change the dynamics of the situation in
favor of the Palestinians. In contrast, Ariel Sharon has sought to avoid
this trap, while also leading a policy designed to prevent Arafat from
claiming any political gains through the use of violence and terror.

The carnage in Jerusalem and Haifa fully exposed the mythology of a
""popular uprising,"" and the leadership of the Palestinian Authority was
seen as responsible for allowing and encouraging terrorism. In response,
Israel launched the broadest military operation to date. The goal is to
force the Palestinian Authority (PA) to implement its commitments, or,
if necessary, to prepare the way for Israel Defense Forces' (IDF)
intervention to destroy the terrorist infrastructure. The Sharon
government's policies are supported by a wide Israeli consensus, and
have the explicit endorsement of the US, as well as broader
international acceptance.

It would be a mistake to view this confrontation simplistically as a
final shoot-out between Sharon and Arafat as individuals, like the
climax of a classic gunslinger movie. The IDF has not sought to kill
Arafat or force his exile--if this was the objective, it could be
readily achieved. Instead, Arafat's escape routes were closed in order
to prevent him from fleeing the scene, for a change. Arafat is being
forced to choose between directing the PA's security forces to dismantle
the terrorist infrastructure, or demonstrating once and for all that he
has no interest in, or capability to fulfill his end of the agreements.
The Oslo process created and granted legitimacy to the Palestinian
Authority, as a nascent state to be developed through interim agreements
and the permanent status negotiations. Israel accepted Arafat's return
from Tunis to lead this process, and the large security forces under his
command were equipped with thousands of automatic weapons. This force
was explicitly designed to provide stability in the territories under PA
control, and to prevent terrorist attacks against Israel.

Instead, from the Israeli perspective, this experiment is now widely
viewed as a disaster. The failure of the Camp David talks in July 2000
showed that Arafat's demands, particularly on the refugee issue, were
tantamount to demanding the end of the Jewish state, and had not changed
since 1947. The incitement and rejection of Israeli legitimacy--as seen
in textbooks, official media, and speeches before international
frameworks such as the United Nations--still fuel violence and terrorism.

At the same time, repeated pledges to dismantle the terrorist
infrastructure have lost credibility. On the contrary, Arafat and the PA
have allowed and encouraged periodic waves of bombings over the past
eight years, as well as other forms of violence. Working with Hamas,
Islamic Jihad, and other groups, the PA itself is viewed as a main
source of terrorism, and warnings of anarchy or the dangers of extremism
after the Arafat era are viewed as no worse than the intolerable status
quo.

Nevertheless, Sharon's decision to use ambiguous terms in defining the
PA as ""an entity that supports terrorism"" gives Arafat one final
opportunity, and also limits the strain within the Israeli coalition
government. The option still exists for an immediate and fully
transparent change in policy. This time, Israelis, Americans, and even
many European leaders expect far more than the empty words, revolving
doors, and house-arrests of top Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders.

However, in the absence of a drastic change, Arafat's status will revert
completely to that of terrorist leader, stripped of political standing
and the benefits of international recognition. Similarly, until the
terrorist infrastructure is visibly dismantled, Israel will treat the
Palestinian Authority as a hostile and dangerous enemy. And if this
stage is reached, the chances for stability and management of this
conflict, and for the establishment of a Palestinian state, will be held
in abeyance for many years, or perhaps generations. This is Arafat's
final opportunity to fulfill his end of the Oslo agreements, and
belatedly begin the long and difficult process of transformation from
zero-sum conflict to stable coexistence and cooperation.
"
"Pal","Neut","For almost four decades, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has dominated
the Palestinian national movement. Arafat himself, and his kuffiyeh,
beard and khaki clothes, have all come to epitomize the Palestinian
people and their national struggle. It is he who has determined the
traits and direction of the fight with Israel and this longevity despite
one obstacle after the other is not only due to Arafat's charismatic
character and good luck, but also to his strategic instinct and tactical
ingenuity.

Arafat's strategic will to survive revolves around three interrelated
areas. These are: self-preservation; preventing the dissipation of the
Palestinian cause; and the achievement of real gains for the Palestinian
people on the land of Palestine (it is often said that Arafat likes to
compare himself to Haj Amin Husseini, in that he, too, desires to leave
behind tangible and concrete accomplishments for the Palestinian people,
however limited).

Tactically, Arafat is a master. He will do whatever it takes to maintain
his hold on the reigns. For this reason, Arafat early on realized the
importance of controlling money and the media. He has commanded them and
used them to achieve his tactical purposes and strategic goals. Although
Arafat is possessive and has authoritarian inclinations, he is not a
dictator.

Instead, from the beginning Abu Ammar has been pragmatic, able to talk
and willing to maneuver. He has also been willing to offer the necessary
concessions even when they came too late, burdened the Palestinian
people and cost them heavily. Still, Arafat has never been dogmatic. He
understands his limits and has tried to stretch those limits, with
varying success. At the moment it appears that he is trying to stretch
those limits farther than they can handle.

As a pragmatist, Arafat has been conciliatory and not dismissive.
Although he always made political decisions on his own, he tried to make
these decisions by preserving legal frameworks and appeasing the
political factions, powerful people and VIPs around him. In turn, this
meant he was always the center of an internal polarization that
led--among other things--to Arafat's turning a blind eye to great
excesses. There have been double standards in policies, which reaped
corruption and the buyout of personal interests. Palestinian public
finances reflect this situation (by no means a problem particular to
Palestinians, but one that is growing).

In short, Abu Ammar has always constituted the compass among
Palestinians for determining what is possible. He has worked to expand
possibilities and whatever internal problems this caused for him, he
always patched things up with incredible conciliatory talents. While he
could not be diverted from his aims, his conciliation guaranteed him a
satisfactory level of acceptance and loyalty among Palestinians. Hidden
within this cycle are an amalgam of internal dysfunctions and problems
that continue to multiply. This is the anomaly--troublesome, but enduring.

The Palestinian condition is desperate and complex. In a region where
ultimate pride lies in statehood and a world deeply involved in the Cold
War, Abu Ammar set off on a national liberation movement, using all of
his tactical abilities, political pragmatism and conciliatory talents.
Despite the tremendous difficulties he faced internally, regionally and
internationally, he has always able to maneuver and create the allies
needed for his survival. He adapted himself to change and moved from one
phase to the next absorbing every loss as if it were a victory.

In this fashion, Arafat was able to paint himself as the one and only
leader of the Palestinians, imposing himself not only on the region, but
on the entire world. He was able (as he always says of the Palestinians)
to impose himself as an indispensable quantity necessary in every
equation related to the fate of this region or others. Arafat has,
therefore, achieved his first two goals of survival and the preservation
of the Palestinian cause. Now he must produce the third component of
lasting results in order to secure his place in history.

Despite repeated political concessions (in 1969, 1974, 1979, 1988), the
world has not yet allowed Arafat to achieve this last component. That
was his goal when he lay the groundwork for a Palestinian state. He
realized the price that would be paid, but thought, as always, that once
he put down the first bricks, the building would grow.

Abu Ammar was able to maneuver much and expand the patch of land under
the Palestinian National Authority little. But he was not able to expand
his political abilities into achieving the aspired-for Palestinian state.

Until, of course, Ehud Barak came to power in Israel. After the
assassination of the skeptic Rabin, and the tenure of a hesitant Peres
and loud-mouthed Netanyahu, Barak began talking about a comprehensive
deal that would result in a Palestinian state. Arafat (now over 70 years
old) was the closest that had ever been to his last goal. Still, Barak
demanded one condition--an end to the conflict.

As usual, Arafat tried to maneuver. But Barak refused and, with active
American help, he trapped Arafat. His offer to accept a Palestinian
state came with a number of conditions, most importantly, those related
to Jerusalem and the refugees. Arafat rejected the offer at face value,
but not in essence. He wanted Barak to come back with something better.
But Barak did not really want to reach a settlement and instead burned
himself out politically. He and Clinton painted a negative picture of
Arafat and international support for Palestinians began to crumble.

The situation called for a Palestinian uprising and it came. But with
it, it brought Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. The two bitter
enemies met again and the conflict, previously camouflaged by the peace
process, rose to the surface and exploded.

Sharon's personal vendetta against Arafat and political objections to
the Palestinian cause are married together. As such, Sharon launched an
escalating systematic campaign to eliminate the possibility that the
Palestinian Authority would become an independent state, preferring a
framework of autonomy under Israeli sovereignty. At the same time, he
began to politically strangle Arafat, weakening him towards
collapse--either by forcing him to carry out Israeli demands to act as
an Israeli tool, or by bringing him down.

Arafat is trying to use all his tactical talents in maneuvering with
Sharon to get out of the present crisis. But the situation, internally,
regionally and worldwide, does not leave him much leeway. Rather, he is
only facing more pressure. In light of a disintegrating relationship
with the Arab world, Arafat has lost all of what he needs to move. What
is required of him exceeds the limits of his pragmatism and his ability
to justify compromise.

As such, Arafat has come back to defending, not the last of his three
strategic components, but the first--his own leadership. It is a battle
that will determine his own fate, and therefore, the future of the
Palestinian cause.
"
"Isr","Neut","In the course of the past two weeks we have been the target of parallel
media campaigns launched from headquarters in Jerusalem and Ramallah.
Prime Ariel Minister Sharon has been interviewed by the Israeli media,
even in his bedroom slippers, to mark the first anniversary of his
election victory. Palestinian leader Arafat is obliged by circumstance
to invite Israeli journalists to visit him in order to speak through
their good offices to the Israeli public. Both, it should be noted, are
speaking only to the Israeli public.

Sharon pats his sheep and displays fistfuls of earth to prove he is in
touch with reality. Arafat reassures us that his order of priorities for
the right of return involves ""only"" 200,000 Palestinian refugees from
Lebanon. The impression is that Arafat is trying first and foremost to
show that the ""punishment"" imposed on him by Sharon two months
ago--confinement to Ramallah--has in no way bowed the leader of the
Palestinian people.

Neither of the two is convincing. Like Sharon, Arafat comes across as
someone constrained by his PR advisors to do what he doesn't enjoy
doing; he would much prefer to dispense with the media. Sharon, too,
will continue to prefer to talk ""off the record."" When confronted with
journalists' tape recorders he falls back on his well-known concepts:
Arafat is irrelevant; without seven days of quiet, political talks won't
be renewed; no one will partition Jerusalem. Arafat, in response,
needles Sharon cautiously, exploiting the cameras to display just how
popular he is. All this, against a backdrop of reports on the
orchestrated pilgrimage of Palestinians to Arafat's besieged
headquarters in Ramallah. Totally unconvincing we already mentioned?
Where is the political plan?

Arafat, like Sharon, emerges as a stubborn client: bad for the
interviewer, very bad for the interviewee. You come to him with a list
of questions and he responds with partial sentences. Instead of answers,
you receive worn out slogans. And all the while, hundreds of thousands
on both sides are desperate to see some white smoke at the end of the
tunnel of violence. How, they ask, can we break the vicious circle of
mutual recriminations? Can someone in Jerusalem or Ramallah reassure us
that this conflict won't escalate yet further?

One of my internet conversation partners, a hard up teacher in a West
Bank refugee camp, writes me two or three times a week and describes
what he and his family go through with the roadblocks, the tanks, the
terrible economic distress. His descriptions, in elegant Arabic, are
very hard to digest. ""Does Arafat have a solution?"" I ask him. It turns
out my correspondent is looking for answers only on the Israeli side.

Under present circumstances it's hard to find media on our side that
will stand up for Arafat. Israelis are more attracted by the latest
idea: to move on to an alternative leadership drawn from Arafat's
entourage. Abu Alaa, Abu Maazen, Sari Nusseibeh, Rajoub, Dahlan--all
have been presented to Israeli news consumers as people who have become
acquainted with their politics and politicians, and who can
realistically identify the red lines, the room for maneuver in the game
of power. They address the Israeli in his own language; none of them
threaten us with more martyrs.

The Israeli man on the street looks ready to grab onto a new Palestinian
persona. Meanwhile Arafat just adds new furrows to our brows every time
he pulls out of thin air accusations of ""depleted uranium"" and poisoned
wells. Better, honorable Rais, to explain the Karine A affair. Believe
me, Chairman Arafat, if you just looked straight at the camera of Israel
TV Channel 1 or 2, stopped throwing out empty promises, and talked about
what is really bothering you and what you intend to do about it in
energetic cooperation with the Israeli peace camp, you would win it over
in minutes.

"Pal","Neut","When two rivals were in conflict in the Middle Ages in Europe, they
resolved the issue in a duel. In the Arabian Peninsula, from the
beginning of time, two adversaries battled in poetry until one claimed
victory over the other.

Here in the Middle East, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon came to life two months ago, each throwing
down the gauntlet and landing punches through statements and press
conferences. Journalists don't attend these press conferences in search
of new developments (they are always the same thing), but only to be a
part of this historic face-off and add a line to their resumes.

All of a sudden, Arafat and Sharon have become generous in granting
interviews and statements without prepared speeches. Everything is now
clear to them and their eyes are turned away from notes diligently
prepared by their advisors.

""Sharon will not reveal his vision of the relationship with the
Palestinians or of a final solution except at the negotiating table,
which will be after the security situation allows,"" we were told when
Palestinian journalists asked an advisor close to the prime minister
what Sharon really wants but hasn't disclosed. ""This way he leaves
himself a margin for negotiation.""

The Palestinian president's position was also an amazing silence.
Palestinians had begun to see his position as a giant riddle--the
silence puzzled them, at the same time that conflicting signals were
coming from other Palestinian leaders.

When university professors asked President Arafat why he had stopped
addressing his people during the more than one year of confrontations
with Israel, he shrugged, ""What should I say?"" He then went on to
express not bewilderment, but a conviction that it was necessary to
refrain from speaking at times when his words would be echoed in
Washington, Tel Aviv and European capitals, misinterpreted by the media
and his own words turned against him.

The leaders' advisors had been worried that each would make statements
not serving their cause. Suddenly, however, there was an about-face. The
flow of statements from Sharon and Arafat gushed out in repetition--they
made themselves very clear.

Now Sharon says, ""Arafat is not a partner; he is a terrorist and we
cannot work with him. We must look for an alternative."" Too, Sharon has
begun to boast that he agrees to a Palestinian state, to be established
after all, after some time and after changes among Palestinians.

Arafat, for his part, says over and over again, ""The Israeli tanks do
not scare me and will not stop me from continuing on this path to
liberate my country, even if a million martyrs result...One hundred
percent of the lands occupied in 1967, with a just solution to the
refugee problem.""

Why has Sharon disclosed what he wants without arriving at the
negotiating table? And how did Arafat conclude that he should unveil his
reasons for insisting at Camp David on a state with real sovereignty, on
100 percent of the land occupied in 1967 (or its equivalent), with a
just solution to the refugee problem? Perhaps for the first time in the
history of his leadership, Arafat has resorted to writing articles in
American newspapers to communicate his words and position to the
American administration, which refuses to listen to him.

After Israel convinced the American administration of its version of the
Karine A ship affair, and the Arab leaders stopped addressing the
Palestinian leader, Sharon saw before him the long-awaited chance to
wring Arafat's neck. It was time to make him surrender--or cause him
death. That is why Sharon has finally relaxed and broken his silence.

But at the very moment when Arafat had nothing more to fear, when
Israeli tanks were practically on his balcony, the barrels of their guns
pointing in the window of his Ramallah presidential headquarters, Arafat
began to sing a different chorus. It was, ""We welcome martyrdom for
Jerusalem"" and its message was strong and fearsome, implying that the
political back and forth had reached its brink and deciding point.
Arafat was threatening the rules of the game, loathe to surrender and
telling the entire world that he does not fear death.

When the laws of classical warfare do not apply, negotiations take place
in the media. Arafat seemed indifferent to Israeli military force and US
support for Sharon's position. He felt that his adversary was not
leaving him any room to maneuver, thus forcing him to reverse the rules
of the game, refusing to surrender and meeting death fearlessly.

Arafat may have used primitive methods to express this, but they were
effective. Even the United States got the message (though it was
whispered that the US wished Arafat would not discuss martyrdom or jihad
in front of his supporters.)

Arafat's declarations vacillated between addressing his supportive
masses in language sending hints to Israel and the United States and an
enormous flow of newspaper articles, culminating in his article on ""The
Palestinian Vision of Peace.""

It is not surprising that ""The Palestinian Vision of Peace"" was written
in English and in the pages of the New York Times--and not in the pages
of the Palestinian publication Al Hayat Al Jadida. Nor is it any
coincidence that most of Sharon's articles were written in English, as
well.

The target audiences of these media negotiations are Washington and
European capitals, above anyone else.
"
"Isr","Neut","In 1991 the coalition victory over Iraq in the Gulf War paved the way
for the Middle East peace process. That process started with the Madrid
Peace Conference in October 1991 and culminated during the '90s in the
conclusion of an Israeli-Jordanian peace agreement and a series of
Israeli-Palestinian partial agreements within the framework of the Oslo
process. Oslo collapsed in 2000 and was engulfed by violence after the
government of Ehud Barak failed in its vigorous attempts to conclude a
permanent agreement with the Palestinians as well as a peace agreement
with Syria.

The assumption that the United States has chosen war on Iraq as the next
stage in the war on terrorism raises an intriguing question: Is this
future war going to have an equally sweeping effect on the Israel-Arab
relationship, and in what manner?

The goals of the war would be the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime and
the resumption of United Nations monitoring regarding weapons of mass
destruction (WMD). These goals are more ambitious than the goals of the
1991 Gulf War. That difference, and the different political environment,
may have several repercussions:

- First, it will be a more risky operation and the possibility of
failure should be taken into account.

- Secondly, the threat to his very existence may lead Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein to react in a brutal and unconstrained way. This could
include the use of weapons of mass destruction against US allies in the
Middle East, Israel and others. That in turn might generate reactions by
Israel and the US that would have a lasting effect on the entire Middle
East.

- Third, this war is not likely to be a coalition war. Most probably it
will be carried out by the US alone, perhaps with some limited British
participation and the passive cooperation of some US allies in the
Middle East.

If the US operation fails, this will undermine the US position in the
Middle East. It will strengthen the radical anti-American regimes and
movements, and will send a very negative signal to the moderates. They
will understand that they cannot count on US protection and that the
only way left for them is to accommodate the radicals and yield to the
anti-US sentiments that are so popular in broad Arab audiences.

This in turn will have a negative effect on the Arab-Israel
relationship. Those who prefer the use of violence against Israel will
gather more confidence while the moderates in the Arab world will be
afraid to challenge them.

Although this possibility of failure has to be considered, it is more
probable that the US will succeed in achieving its goals. The proven US
military capabilities, the weakness of Iraq's armed forces and the fact
that Saddam's regime is hated by so many Iraqis, all give credence to
the assumption that with careful planning, equal to the level of
planning of the Afghanistan operation, the US can succeed in this mission.

Success will have the opposite effect of failure. US allies in the
Middle East will be encouraged, US deterrence will be strengthened, and
the anti-American regimes and movements will probably be more cautious
and less provocative. Iran, for example, has a record of behaving very
pragmatically when it faces high risks and high costs. A US victory may
have a great restraining effect on it, including on its willingness to
support and encourage anti-Israeli violence. Syria certainly will
continue with its present relatively cautious policies and will try to
restrain Hizballah. The Palestinians will probably understand that they
have to be more cautious. It is also possible that the Iraqi defeat will
dampen the enthusiasm of the Palestinian extremists. On the other hand
Israel will probably feel more confident and less threatened by the
threat of escalation with Arab states. This implies that Israel will
assume that it can concentrate on the more urgent issue of the conflict
with the Palestinians.

These probable results of a US victory may create an opportunity to
effect a real change in the development of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. This could take either one of two opposite directions. One
possibility is further escalation; Israel may decide that this is an
opportunity to get rid of Yasir Arafat and the Palestinian Authority and
to re-conquer the Palestinian areas, based on the assumption that such a
complete reshuffling of the cards will improve Israel's capabilities to
prevent violent attacks on its citizens and perhaps even create an
opportunity for a new political process.

On the other hand, a US victory could create an opportunity for a new
effort to stop the violence and resume negotiations, with improved
chances of success. This will not be easy, insofar as the leaders of the
two parties are gradually losing control over the escalation, and are
locked in a vicious circle of actions and counter-actions.

The direction that the conflict takes following a successful US war
effort against Iraq depends to a great extent on the role the US plays.
US prestige and power in the Middle East will reach a peak that can be
used to resume leadership of the Israeli-Palestinian process and the
peace process as a whole-the way taken by Secretary of State Baker in
1991. The US will have to coerce the parties involved to change
direction, and will have to be willing to invest the necessary resources
and commitment for such an initiative to succeed. Recent experience,
including the post-September 11 period, shows that the two parties alone
are not capable of exploiting opportunities for a genuine reversal of
the situation.

Will American leadership rise to the challenge, or remain a passive
bystander? This is the real question.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: Do you think the United States will attack Iraq?

A: I think that the United States desires this, but an attack
will depend on many factors. One of these is how the Iraqis will behave.
If [Iraqi President] Saddam Hussein does things the way he did in 1990
and 1991, then obviously he will give the Americans the opportunity.

I do not think that the positions of the Arab states will assist the US.
Let's be frank, the attack against Iraq in 1991 was only possible
because Kuwait and Saudi Arabia financed the whole operation. The
Americans at that time were interested in oil supply, but also in
getting rid of all the munitions stock left in German after the end of
the Cold War.

I am not sure that Saudi Arabia or Kuwait will now finance such an
adventure. The second thing is that I am not sure that the Saudis or the
Kuwaitis will offer the use of their bases. The Americans can launch an
attack without those bases, but it will not have the same impact and
efficiency. The third factor is the position of the Europeans and the
Russians.

Q: What will happen in the Middle East in general, as a
result of an attack?

A: I think it will be a tragedy, first of all, because I am
sure that the Iraqis are not developing weapons of mass destruction. To
develop such things, you need know-how technology. This technology is in
the hands of either the Europeans, like the French who twice gave the
Iraqis nuclear reactors, or China or some advanced states. I am sure
that none of these advanced states, whether the Europeans or Russia or
even China are ready to supply the Iraqis with the components for
weapons of mass destruction.

We have to understand why the Americans want to hit Iraq, which is to
redraw the map in the Middle East. I think the Americans want to get rid
of all who are against American policy in the area and even to create
new territorial entities, maybe to divide Iraq, and to push the Saudis
or Gulf States in general to apply new policies that do not breed
fundamentalists like those we saw in the events of September 11.

Q: How might Palestinians and Israelis try to manipulate this
issue?

A: I think that the Israelis are already trying to exaggerate
the Iraqi capacity. In 1991, they created a great deal of propaganda
about the Scud missiles and succeeded in getting many millions of
dollars as a result. In reality, we were talking about 39 missiles. I am
not approving that, but let's be frank, we are talking about 39
missiles, each of which only has 250 kilograms of TNT.

That means that all the missiles launched against Israel combined
carried less than one half of the munitions dropped in one B-52 bombing
raid, which drops 21 tons in one air raid alone. Today, Iraq has even
less capacity.

The UN inspections teams spent seven years in Iraq and what they will
now find, they already know about. I am not saying that Iraq was not
entertaining biological or chemical weapons, but I think that most of
these have been destroyed and rendered insignificant. Still, the
Israelis are trying to influence the Americans.

The Palestinian capacity to influence American decision-making is
insignificant, but I think that the Palestinians, through their Intifada
and maybe taking public positions against hitting Iraq, could have some
impact.

In the Gulf War, I argued very strongly that the Iraqi invasion was an
aggression and that we as Palestinians could not accept that a stronger
power would invade a smaller state even under the pretext of uniting the
Arab world. But this time, things are different. The Iraqis are not
invading anyone and they have suffered a huge loss. It is enough.
Despite the fact that I really would like if Iraq were to get rid of
Saddam Hussein, I don't think that this will happen through the
destruction of Iraq. As a matter of fact, I think that the economic
embargo mainly helped Saddam Hussein in becoming the only financial
power inside Iraq and in manipulating internal politics.

But Palestinians seem not to be relating a lot between what is going on
in Palestine and Iraq. We have to understand that there will be an
important relationship, to think about it and how to deal with it. When
the Americans hit Iraq and succeed at destroying Saddam and changing the
regime, I think they will give the green light to the Israelis to
destroy the Palestinians. I think that there is some relationship
between what is going on in Palestine today and what will happen in Iraq.

Palestinians have to, on the one hand, convince the Iraqis to be less
hard-line, and on the other hand offer their position loudly and
frankly. Our role is to try to prevent an attack against Iraq, but not
appear at all to be allies of Saddam Hussein. And if the Americans are
really ready to do something good for Palestinians, let it be before a
strike on Iraq, not after.
"
"Isr","Neut","Judging by the number of statements made by United States President
George W. Bush regarding the separation fence, or ""wall"" as he termed it
a while ago, one might conclude that this is one of the central problems
confronting American foreign policy. Indeed, based on the diplomatic and
media interest displayed in the fence in western Europe, we could assume
that this is one of the central problems of the world.

We recall that the primary impetus for constructing the fence came from
the Israeli political left. Beyond enhancing security, the left had two
principal objectives: 1) once again to separate the State of Israel from
Judea and Samaria, and thereby to ensure that in Judea and Samaria there
would arise a Palestinian state; and 2) to isolate the settlers, to
cause them to feel ""beyond the fence""--a loaded term from the standpoint
of Jewish history, meaning removal from the community--so their will
would break and they would abandon the settlements, or at least the more
distant and isolated ones.

We also recall that, for precisely the same reasons that the left
supported the fence, the settlers opposed it. But they had a problem:
they feared lest their opposition be interpreted as sectorial
selfishness--as if, in order to prevent the political fallout from the
fence, they were ready to detract from the overall security of Israelis,
most of whom, including supporters of the settlers, saw in the fence a
genuine source of salvation. Indeed, the Yesha Council (Council of the
Communities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza) took a position contrary to that
of the majority of residents of the ideological settlements, and ceased
opposing the fence. Notably, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon initially
opposed the fence for the same reasons as the settlers. But he changed
his position under massive pressure from a panicky public, orchestrated
by the media with its decisive leftist influence.

The separation fence does not lie precisely on the green line, as the
left and the Palestinians wanted. In at least one area, Ariel, it is
planned to curve some 20 kilometers deep into the region that they,
along with their Israeli and American supporters, see as the future
Palestinian state. Not surprisingly, this has turned the tables: the
left and the front organizations it generated to ""push"" the fence (e.g.,
regional councils comprising villages connected organizationally
directly to the Labor Party, various non-governmental organizations,
etc.) have now begun to follow the American lead and oppose the fence.
After all, America is the source of authority; its plans, such as the
roadmap                                                 , are supported
by the left, which depends mainly on American pressure in order to
realize its political schemes.

Yet it is on the right, particularly among the settlers, that the more
dramatic turnabout has taken place. The settlers' support for the fence
has evolved from ex post facto tactical acquiescence to something
approaching strategic support. Their detractors, including the analysts
of Israeli affairs in the intelligence and foreign offices of Europe and
the United States, can now draw far-reaching conclusions:

First, Sharon's fence, the fence that has provoked such strong protest
from the president, the Palestinians and the Israeli left, leaves under
Palestinian sovereignty large portions of the historic Land of Israel.

Secondly, the settlers' support for the current course of the fence
ostensibly proves, at least judging by the policy of their
representative body, the Yesha Council, that at the deepest ideological
level the primary motivation for the massive settlement movement of the
past three decades--maintaining the territory of the Land of Israel
under the sovereignty of the State of Israel--is no longer the central
objective.

Accordingly, preserving the settlement status quo, i.e., the existence
of the settlements, is from herein the central goal of the Yesha Council.

On Sunday, August 10, Israel's activist foreign minister, Sylvan Shalom,
announced that ""even friends can disagree"" and that Israel, despite
considerable American opposition, ""will continue to build the separation
fence as planned."" Here the Sharon government's objectives dovetail with
those of the settlers, who have a realistic assessment of its ability to
maneuver. The government cannot and perhaps does not wish to challenge
the Americans regarding the roadmap, i.e., concerning the establishment
of a Palestinian state. Regarding the fence, on the other hand, the
government is prepared for a confrontation. The reason: most voters,
worn down by the past three years' vicious terrorist war, will support
it over the fence, even if this means confrontation with America--but
will not support confrontation over a Palestinian state. Perhaps, too,
someone senior in the Israeli government knows that regarding the fence,
despite the harsh exchanges, the Americans will not enter into all-out
confrontation with Israel.

The important issue for the administration is the roadmap. If it can be
implemented, the American taxpayer will in any case have to fork out
tens of billions of dollars. So it makes little difference if two or
three billion are added to cover the cost of dismantling the present
fence and building a new one--a fence that follows the course of the
border which, the Americans calculate, will be agreed upon in accordance
with the roadmap.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What is the current status of the wall?

A: Israel has now completed one-third of the wall, from Salim to
south of Qalqilya [in the northern West Bank]. This section is more than
110 kilometers long. A week ago, Israel approved another $100 million to
build the section of the wall that will attach the settlement of Ariel
to Israel.

The wall is now more visible than at any time before, and it is more
clear what the Israelis intended this wall to be. We were told that
there would be 26 gates in the wall [to allow Palestinians access to
their land on the other side]. Of the six gates that have been built,
two are totally closed. Other gates are partially closed [by barricades]
and trucks can't cross to bring the produce from the fields. Most of the
gates are only open for certain hours, and not the proper hours. For
example, one gate is open from 7 to 8 in the morning and from 4 to 5 in
the afternoon. But it is hot here, and farmers usually work from before
dawn until six, then return to their fields in the late afternoon and
come home late in the evening.

The other thing that we are seeing is that farmers crossing the gates
are being treated as if they are crossing into Israel, and are therefore
being asked to show a permit.

Lately, Israel has started to work on a road connecting Israeli land to
a settlement just behind the wall [in the West Bank]. They didn't tell
the Palestinian farmers [that owned this land] that the land would be
confiscated but are behaving as if that land is now part of Israel.
There was no notification, no confiscation order, nothing.They are doing
what they want with it. It has become quite clear that Israel intended
this to be a border, intended to confiscate this land, and intended to
prevent the farmers from coming to their land.

Q: What is your perception of the Bush administration's
comments about the wall?

A: We have had bad experiences with the US, even with what might
have been called a more liberal administration. I think that these
comments came out of the administration's frustration after it received
criticism over the war in Iraq. After [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel]
Sharon arrived in Washington, Bush reversed himself and said that there
was an understanding that the wall was for Israel's security.

Q: What do you see as the greatest challenge in the
campaign to fight the wall?

A: To mobilize the entire international community. We would like
to believe that an apartheid system can no longer exist in this century,
but now we are witnessing much worse. I think that we should work
together to prevent this, but it is happening so quickly.

In a very short time we will see the West Bank divided into three major
cantons and ten other enclaves and all the Palestinian people will be
surrounded and besieged. Because of past experience, we won't now
believe someone who only /talks/ about this issue, because it seems that
in this ""peace"" we are always paying the price. People have now learned
that ""peace"" is meant only to satisfy Israel's needs, while no one seems
to care about the occupation.

Q: Why should the average American or European care about
this wall?

A: If we look at the second intifada and how the world has
deteriorated, this region is one of the main reasons for this
deterioration. We can't deny that September 11 was related to what is
happening here. To solve the problem of the wall is to solve one of the
fundamental issues in the region.

I don't think it is very difficult; what is needed is for the
international community to force Israel to apply international law. We
don't want anything more than that. But what we are seeing now is that
the decision-makers, those who /created/ these laws, are just ignoring
them and establishing new rules to satisfy Israel.

Q: Are you satisfied with what the Palestinian Authority is
doing on the issue?

A: Unfortunately, the Authority's actions came late, but we saw
what happened when the Authority presented the issue, and how the
Americans reacted. One of our main demands is that there be no
negotiations without first stopping construction and dismantling this
wall. Otherwise we will be falling into the trap of the Oslo accords.

The first thing that Israel did after Oslo was to open the bypass roads
[connecting the settlements to Israel] and to double the number of
settlers. Now we are stuck because of this. If we go to negotiations
now, the same thing will happen. We will talk for one or two years, the
wall will be finished around us and we will be stuck again. But this
time, they are putting the final touches on the conflict.

I don't think that Palestinians will accept living in ghettos. This will
not be the reward for their struggle and sacrifice. We were struggling
for our freedom and for our identity and we won't accept to live as
slaves controlled by a bunch of racist settlers, so I think that
Palestinians will be much more aggressive, much more determined and much
more together.
"
"Isr","Neut","Since October 2000, Palestinian-Israeli relations have gone through a
deep crisis. This crisis may lead either to a total deterioration in the
whole area or paradoxically form a catalyst for peace. As other cases of
deep conflict in the world show, the ""status quo option"" is not viable.

There are many indications that we are approaching some sort of
resolution of the conflict, which might be temporary (once again
transitional arrangements before the next explosion) or a more
comprehensive resolution with the backing of Arab countries and the
world community. In any event, there is an overriding need to speak
about the dynamics of relationships between the external conflict and
internal conflicts within both Palestinian and Israeli societies. In
what follows, we will briefly delineate the repercussions of possible
settlement of the Israel-Arab-Palestinian conflict on Jewish-Arab
relations in Israel and the measures that should be taken in order to
create a reasonable atmosphere, which may serve as a stimulus for peace.

The status and conditions of the Palestinians in Israel have been deeply
affected by the Israel-Arab conflict, and mainly the conflict with the
Palestinian people. Despite the many difficulties and contradictions,
the Palestinians in Israel have developed over time an identity with two
main components: national (Palestinian-Arab component) and citizenship
(Israeli). This unique compound identity is the result of the
simultaneous existence of two reference groups--the Jewish majority in
Israel at the citizenship level and the Palestinian people and Arab
world at the national level. In both spheres, however, the Palestinians
in Israel are only partial members. As a result, their status is that of
a ""double periphery"" located on the margins of both Israeli society and
the Palestinian national movement.

No far-reaching change in the formal policy toward the Palestinian
citizens of Israel can take place unless this external conflict is
resolved. Accordingly, the peace process is expected to considerably
improve the status of the Palestinians in Israel.

Unlike the common misconception, we argue here that any peaceful
settlement for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict that does not take into
consideration internal social issues, including the expansion of the
borders of legitimacy of Israeli society (beyond the present
ethno-national character of Israel) would just deepen the status of the
Palestinians in Israel as a ""double periphery,"" thus creating a great
potential explosion that might even endanger the whole process.

Judging by the Oslo agreements, the main motivation for peace on the
Israeli side was the need for separation between the Palestinians and
the Israelis, so as to preserve the Jewish-Zionist character of the
state and prevent its conversion into a binational state. This argument
has been voiced by Jewish leaders of both the Zionist right and left.
Hence the start of the implementation of the Oslo accords and later the
acceptance of these accords by Netanyahu's Likud government brought
about a significant decrease in the differences between the Zionist
right and left in Israel.

The Oslo accords increased the confusion and distress of the Zionist
left, since it has no clear social agenda. Social issues (associated
with class gaps, women, Arab citizens, etc.) have never been a main
interest of the Israeli left. Therefore, the Israeli left's lobbying on
behalf of peace has been divorced of any social-citizenship content.

One may conjecture that even though (as several polls show) there is a
majority among the Jewish public supporting a compromise for the
Israel-Palestinian conflict (based on separation), the Jewish majority
is becoming more closed on the civil level, which is associated with a
change in the nature of the state and the policy toward the Palestinians
in Israel. Therefore, the idea of transfer is gaining more support and
legitimacy over time among the Israeli Jewish public and policymakers
alike.

It follows that the crisis in Jewish-Arab relations in Israel today is
not the result of the October 2000 events, in which 13 Palestinian
citizens were killed by Israeli security forces. Rather, these events
are the issue of a gradual crisis that has accelerated since the start
of the ""peace process,"" just as the al-Aqsa Intifada erupted against the
backdrop of gradual frustration and a deep crisis in the peace process.

Therefore, if a genuine change is to stand a chance, there must be a
radical shift in the Israeli strategy of conflict resolution. The
resolution of the external Israel-Palestinian-Arab conflict should be
accompanied by a social agenda that aims at nurturing a civil society in
Israel (and of course in Palestine). The assumption that social rifts
can be allowed to fester until the external conflict has been dealt with
has proved to be false. As experience elsewhere indicates, the
resolution of external conflicts tends to sharpen internal divisions
rather than reduce them.

Developing such a combined strategy for conflict resolution at the
external and internal levels is not easy to achieve, especially under
existing circumstances. One of the crucial conditions for the start of
such a process involves the construction of a wide coalition for peace
and equality through continuing dialogue, grassroots projects in the
fields of civil society and multicultural education, and a series of
activities to make policymakers and the public at large more aware of
the repercussions of the various future scenarios.

"Pal","Neut","The Arabs in Israel were an inseparable part of the Palestinian people
until 1948. After the wars that led to the establishment of the state of
Israel and the dispersal of the Palestinian people, this community was
separated from the other Palestinian communities in neighboring Arab
countries. Before delving into the history of Arabs in Israel, however,
it is useful to examine the results of the1948 War, which still form a
basis for the socio-political status of Arabs within Israel and indeed,
most of the greater Palestinian community.

After the 1949 ceasefire agreements signed between Israel and the
neighboring Arab states, there were approximately 150,000 Arabs still
living within the Green Line. This community comprised nearly one-sixth
of the Palestinians that had been living in the area that became the
state of Israel. The war had dispersed some 750,000 Palestinians, who
became refugees in neighboring Arab countries.

The Arabs who stayed in their homeland found themselves in an unenviable
situation. While the Arabs in Israel became citizens and enjoyed some of
the rights of citizenship, they were also completely cut off from the
rest of the Arab world--in particular, the Palestinian people. Inside
their homeland, they were treated with hostility, large tracts of their
land were expropriated and they lived under military rule until 1966.
This was the most difficult period for Arabs in Israel, who were
struggling just to survive under the oppressive policies enforced by
military authorities in Arab areas.

The 1948 War destroyed Palestinian society and its cultural and
political elite. When the leadership was dispersed and only vulnerable
segments of the Palestinian people remained, Israel was able to Judaize
the Arab areas and dispossess the Arabs within Israel of their
Palestinian identity. The Israeli authorities then imposed their
policies on the Arab areas, which were completely isolated from the rest
of the Arab world.

A very small minority of Arabs within Israel challenged Israeli policies
under that military rule. The most prominent among them were the
Communists and Pan-Arabists, who rejected Israeli policies towards the
Arab community. But in general, until 1967, the Arabs within Israel paid
dearly for holding fast to their homeland. They were isolated from the
Arab world and were subjected to Israeli policies of the military
administration specific only to the Arab community.

After the disastrous 1967 War, the Arabs within Israel emerged from
their isolation and renewed their contact with the Palestinian people
and the rest of the Arab world. The 1966 end of military rule and the
Israeli authorities' subsequent preoccupation with controlling the
Palestinian areas occupied in 1967 had an overwhelming effect on Arabs
within Israel. Starting in the mid-seventies, they gained
self-confidence and shaped a clear political agenda.

This agenda still stands today, although it has been refined over the
last three decades. It is based on two fundamental demands: peace and
equality. Peace is to be based on the establishment of a Palestinian
state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip under the leadership of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, and civil equality is to be created
between Arab and Jewish citizens of Israel as a condition for reaching
historical reconciliation and an end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

The overwhelming majority of Arabs within Israel supported the Oslo
Accords in 1993 because they broached the possibility of ending the
occupation and establishing a Palestinian state. At that time, the
government of Yitzhak Rabin sought to bridge the gaps between Arabs and
Jews by applying a policy of gradual parity.

These policies of the Rabin government enraged Israel's extreme
right-wing opposition. Rabin's assassination on November 4, 1995 was the
beginning of the end for the policies of equality and peace. Today,
years after Rabin's assassination, it is fair to say that the assassin
and his supporters in Israel's extreme right have succeeded in their
mission.

The future of Arabs within Israel and their attainment of equal civil
rights are inextricably tied to the future of the struggle between
Israel and the Palestinians. The continuation of the occupation and the
bloody conflict between the two peoples threatens even the few gains the
Arabs within Israel have achieved since the seventies. On the other
hand, ending the occupation and establishing a Palestinian state in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip only realizes one demand of the Arabs within
Israel. Their second demand is total equality. They demand an end to the
discrimination inherent in a state ""solely for Jews,"" and demand that
Israel become a state for all of its citizens, both Arab and Jewish.

Today, as Israeli society stands on the threshold of new elections, its
citizens must choose between peace and equality, or occupation and the
continuation of conflict. If the successive government chooses the
latter, then the political right will have succeeded in blocking the
path to peace and equality based on dividing historic Palestine and
establishing two states. In that case, the Arabs in Israel, and
Palestinians in general, will be forced to create a new political
agenda. For example, this agenda might press for the establishment of a
democratic binational state on the entire land of Palestine from the
Jordan River to the sea, rather than an oppressive regime of racist
policies and apartheid.

Ending the occupation and establishing a Palestinian state in the areas
occupied since 1967 is a condition necessary to enable the Palestinian
minority within Israel to obtain total equality as citizens. Accepting
that solution would be a major concession, one made in order to reach a
historic reconciliation between the Jews and Arabs. If the political
right wing succeeds in thwarting this solution, it will not only
undermine chances of peace between the two peoples, but will also
threaten the stability of Israeli society and the Israeli political
system.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: What is your demographic forecast for the year 2020?

A: First we have to clarify what we are discussing. The
population figures are confusing. We have ""Palestine"" from the
Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River, we have official Israel, and we
have unofficial Israel including additional foreign workers and
Palestinian illegals who crossed the green line in the last 35 years in
large numbers. Moreover in Jerusalem the Arabs are citizens not of
Israel but of Jerusalem.

If we talk about the area from the river to the sea, at this moment Jews
are a minority vis-a-vis non-Jews, because we count about 300,000
foreign workers. Jews are about 48-49 percent, and will decrease to
about 39 percent in another 16 years.

If we withdraw to the green line or to a unilateral separation line, we
are now 77 percent Jews in Israel, and in another 16 years will be 71
percent--the rest being Arab citizens of Israel--or 64 percent if we
include non-citizens, i.e., foreign workers and Palestinian non-citizens.

Q: Israel has an active program of deporting illegal
foreign workers.

A: In no western country have they managed to solve the problem
of foreign workers; they'll live with us forever. It's the same all over
the globe.

Q: What is the scope of illegal Palestinian migration into
Israel since 1967? Will the fence reverse the trend?

A: Based on official statistics and my own surveys, I calculate
that more or less 300,000 Arabs have managed to ""return"" since 1948.
Prior to 1967, some 40,000 came illegally and legally; since then entry
has been by migration, lawful and unlawful, fictitious marriages, and
displaced West Bank Palestinians from 1967 who come as tourists and half
of whom stay here. Not all come because of ""return"". Between Mexico and
the US, the GNP gap is one to four, while between Israel and the West
Bank it's one to 17.

Q: So you're describing a north-south phenomenon? The
Israeli economy needs the workers?

A: Indeed, much of this has nothing to do with the conflict, but
rather with the economic gap. In our case it has been very easy to cross
the border. The fence will stop this so we can regulate this phenomenon
and separate it from ""return"". Note that 14,000 [West Bank] Palestinians
used to work in Umm al Fahm [an Arab town on the Israeli side of the
green line, now separated by the fence]; now only 3,000 remain.

Q: Looking at Israel's internal demographic problem, what
are the ramifications of Palestinian (Israeli Arab) population growth
inside Israel, especially in the Galilee and the northern Negev?

A: The mountainous Galilee area assigned to the Palestinian state
in the 1947 partition plan still has around 65 percent Arabs and 35
percent Jews despite all the incentives [for Jews to settle there].
Jewish youth are leaving Misgav and the Galilee for the Tel Aviv area.
From Biranit at the Lebanese border along the mountain spine through the
Galilee and the Afula area there is a link to Jenin and from there via
the West Bank to Jerusalem (an Arab city, depending how you define the
boundaries) down to Hebron and the Israeli Bedouin in the northern
Negev, with a potential to link up with Gaza, though there is still
Jewish territory in between. The problem with the Bedouin is a rate of
five percent annual natural increase, thereby doubling the population
every ten years--the highest rate in the world.

Q: How do you propose for Israel to counter this?

A: At the geographic level, I would create a new wedge of Jewish
settlement in the Jezreel Valley/Taanachim/Afula area, and again between
Gaza and the Israeli Bedouin in the Ashkelon/Sderot area, and along the
green line ""seam line"", the ""stars"" settlements west of the green line.

At the national level, we must begin by Judaizing all the non-Jewish
Russian immigrants, who now number 231,000. We can further reduce the
potential hostile internal population by co-opting the Druze and the
Christian Arabs. Turning to Jerusalem, why do we need east Jerusalem? We
should separate east Jerusalem from the rest and annex the holy basin
unilaterally. This would leave another 250,000 Arabs on the other side
of the fence. Then [only] 1.5 million Muslims would remain under Israeli
control in 2020.

Q: And between Israel and the West Bank and Gaza, what is
your demographic solution?

A: I'm ready to wait for a negotiated peace, but if I put myself
in [Palestinian leader Yasser] Arafat's head or that of any proud
Palestinian, they are asking: ""what will the Jews leave us if they
withdraw to the green line? A prison called Gaza, one called Hebron, and
another called Nablus or Samaria. They [the Jews] won't accept the right
of return and will retain a mighty army. We Palestinians will have
corridors to Gaza within Jewish territory. This is unacceptable. We have
to just wait another ten years and we'll have a majority in all of
Palestine and an apartheid situation where the world will support us.
Israelis will leave. Time is in our favor.""

Thus I don't think we have a partner for real negotiations, and we need
to take our own steps, to return to the green line, plus the settlement
blocs, minus Umm al-Fahm. The green line is not an international line,
it's a ceasefire line, and to avoid a Jewish civil war we need the
settlement blocs.

Q: Shouldn't both Israel and the Palestinians be reducing
their rates of population growth?

A: Yes. Just the effects of sewage and the ecological impact of
another three million people in Eretz Israel are a disaster that will
put us in the third world. We, both of us, are committing suicide, yet
the Palestinians are encouraging natural increase and so are we. For our
part we should not have restrictions on immigration, but we should
encourage the Singapore law, under which parents who have more than two
children have to pay all their educational and other expenses. It's
moral for President Mubarak of Egypt and Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran to
talk birth control, but not us?
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What do you make of the recent flurry of Israeli reports
and predictions concerning Palestinian and Israeli population growth?

A: I think this is purely a reflection of their nightmare
concerning their own concept of the Jewishness of the state. They don't
want to recognize that the only way to preserve the Jewishness of the
state, if one looks at the way Israel was created, is to conduct a
comprehensive, persistent and regular [forced] exodus of the Palestinian
people because historic Palestine has one indigenous population and one
implanted population. Otherwise, the best way for Israelis to wake up
from this nightmare is by creating a Palestinian state next door.

Q: Which of these recent Israeli demographic assessments is
most accurate, in your opinion?

A: Historic Palestine has two populations, Israeli and
Palestinian. As of today, the Palestinian population is not the
majority. But in two years time--only two years time--we will be
reporting that the two populations are equal, regardless of what the
Israelis do. In the year 2006, 50 percent of historic Palestine will be
composed of Palestinians, and 50 percent will be composed of Israelis.
Every year that follows, the majority will be for the Palestinians. I
know that [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon has been making his own
plans to bring in one million Jews by the year 2010. Even if this
happens (which I doubt), the Palestinians will continue to grow as a
majority in historic Palestine.

As for the Palestinians that are now Israeli citizens, their percentage
is somewhat stable, but slowly growing. Now they are around 20 percent
of the Israeli population. Gradually this will increase because the
Palestinian population reproduces much faster.

Q: This poses a lot of political questions for the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, but is it also a policy problem for
Palestinians?

A: Indeed. With every additional Palestinian, we will have to
produce a lot of resources that we may not have. It is a fact of life
that Palestinians are more fertile than Israelis, they grow [as a
population] much faster than Israelis and with this, there are pros and
cons. In my opinion, we will have to face a special music of our own in
feeding all these babies and this is a very serious challenge facing
Palestinians from a socio-economic perspective.

But the question here is not one of Palestinians trying to overcome
Israel through demography, it is a question of Israel trying to preserve
a specific nature using means that will have terrible consequences.
Therefore, the problem should not be looked at from the Palestinian
perspective.

The question is, what will Israelis do? What kind of a state do they
want to have? If they want to have a Jewish state, they have only two
options. One is to accelerate their own efforts to help create a
Palestinian state within the borders of 1967, which means that Israel
will retain a majority of Jewish blood and have to live with the fact of
a Palestinian minority. But under the current Israeli political and
settlement plan, they are only making it impossible for Israel to be a
Jewish state.

Q: Do you think that the Palestinian birthrate has
increased with the intifada and do you have data to support that?

A: We have historically observed that whenever there is an
increased threat facing the Palestinian population, they tend to
increase their fertility rate. We witnessed this immediately after the
Lebanon war, after the first intifada and we do have a slow increase in
the fertility rates nowadays. Of course, this reflects socioeconomic
conditions--a high number of unemployed Palestinians, women not finding
opportunities in the marketplace--these are the typical parameters for
increasing fertility rate in any population. We also have limited
outward migration, especially during the last few years (before that we
had serious inward migration) and a low infant mortality rate, which
also affects the size of the population.

Q: One of the complaints of some Palestinian citizens of
Israel about the Geneva accord
                                               was that it granted
legitimacy to the concept of Israel as a ""Jewish state"", which in turn
damages their own quest for rights as equal citizens.

A: I think that this concept is a racist concept. Israel
should raise the slogan that it is a state for all its citizens--Jews,
Christians, Muslims, etc. If they must have a ""Jewish state"", then they
will have to deal with the immense problem of a growing minority that is
basically stripped of its rights. In my opinion, I would rather see next
door a state that grants equal rights to its citizens and allows all its
citizens to prosper.

Q: How was Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei's recent statement
concerning a one-state solution related to demographic issues?

A: This was a statement of what the facts may lead to: if the
default on the peace process continues, the Palestinians will eventually
find themselves struggling to survive within the boundaries of a state
that is keeping them in large segregated areas. With the diminishing of
the chances for establishing a viable independent sovereign state,
Palestinians will have no choice but to claim their rights.
"
"Isr","Neut","It appears as if the Bush administration has finally reached its moment
of decision on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the wake of the
American triumph in Iraq, the conflict in the Holy Land has been
repositioned as problem number one for Washington's foreign policy. But
will President George W. Bush rise to the challenge and prove his
determination and toughness on the Israeli-Palestinian quagmire, or will
he make do with the lower intensity ""conflict management"" that he has
adopted until now?

On the surface, all the ingredients are there for a courageous
diplomatic effort to stop the bloodshed and push Israelis and
Palestinians toward a renewed peace process. There are high expectations
for change from the two conflicted societies, fatigued after over 30
months of continuous violence. There are political debts to pay to
America's allies in the Arab world and London, who supported and
participated in the removal of Saddam Hussein and begged Washington to
deal with the Palestine issue. There are the prime ministers in
Jerusalem and Ramallah, who pledge their commitment to peacemaking. And
unlike in Iraq, where the United States encountered strong opposition
from many countries to its planned regime change, there are no real
opponents to the Bush vision of two states, Israel and Palestine, living
side by side in peace, security and prosperity. Regional extremists are
at their low point, and the rest of the world follows the American lead.

All these factors are well recognized in Washington and throughout the
Middle East. At this point, however, the Bush administration prefers not
to take the plunge, but rather to remain on the safe side of diplomatic
daring. Its policy formula could be termed ""semblance of intervention""
or ""safe-side engagement."" It looks like the real thing, with
presidential speeches, an internationally accepted peace plan (the
roadmap                                                 ), and
high-level trips to the region. But so far, it has stopped short of
moving Israelis and Palestinians beyond empty gestures.

The model of post-Iraq American intervention is not new. It was invented
by the elder Bush administration in 1991, when the United States used
its coincidental victories in the Gulf War and the Cold War to drag
Arabs and Israelis to the Madrid Peace Conference, which launched a
first-ever direct peace process. Madrid and the ensuing negotiations,
from Oslo to Camp David, have not ended the conflict. Yet they brought
about a decade of relative calm and better stability in the region, and
managed to delimit the areas of dispute between Israel and its two
adversary neighbors, Syria and the Palestinians, so that the blueprint
for any future settlement is on the table.

The younger Bush administration refrains from grand gestures and prefers
to move the process in a ""bottom-up"" manner--starting from mutual small
steps, which are supposed to lead to larger steps, until both Israelis
and Palestinians restore their shattered confidence and are ready to
discuss the tough issues. This approach is presumably tailored to the
absorptive capacity of the rival leaderships, as it delays their tough
political struggles at home. However it carries a great risk of
disruption, since any progress is measured in inches at best. Thus the
public can hardly feel the movement, while adversaries of peace, or
stubborn leaders, are able to derail the process with relatively little
effort. At the same time, the responsibility for any failure lies with
the quarreling duo, while the Americans can walk away unharmed.

Upon his arrival in Jerusalem last Saturday, US Secretary of State Colin
Powell tried to avoid friction and conflict and emphasized agreement on
the need to start implementing the roadmap. He called upon the
Palestinians to uproot terrorism and the Israelis to ease the
Palestinians' humanitarian and economic hardships. The larger issues
discussed in the roadmap--which sets a three-stage, three-year plan to
establish a Palestinian state and solve outstanding disputes--were
shelved for the time being.

One can argue that Powell has no real choice, as he faces two difficult
interlocutors. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is all but committed
to peacemaking and ""painful concessions,"" but only in the far future;
right now, his gestures are timid, as he demands changes in the roadmap
and seeks to avoid political trials at home. His record puts his
sincerity in doubt: he has thus far successfully blocked any peace plan
during his term. His government has avoided any real move to restrain
settlement growth in the West Bank and Gaza, despite its repeated
half-hearted pledges to do so. Israelis feel they are winning the war,
and this is not a good recipe for compromise. And last but definitely
not least, Bush's perceived support for Israel helps him win crucial
Jewish votes and contributions as he readies himself for his reelection
campaign.

On the other side, Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen)
still lacks serious authority; he could not even host Powell in
Ramallah, the de facto Palestinian capital, for fear of the shadow of
his leader Yassir Arafat. It is doubtful whether Abu Mazen will be able
to rein in the terrorist groups in the West Bank and Gaza and fulfill
Sharon's tough demand for ""100 percent effort"" on security. Moreover,
craving legitimacy, Abu Mazen will have great difficulty compromising
with Israel.

Given these hurdles, no wonder Powell and his master in Washington are
reluctant to take big risks. But their cautious approach may deliver a
stillborn vision. Bush has proven his ability to take considerable
diplomatic and even military risks--on missile defense, transatlantic
relations and Iraq, to name a few--but he appears to lack this
determination on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. While solidifying
America's commitment to the two-state solution as none of his
predecessors ever did, Bush has refrained from expending serious
political capital to implement that vision. His prudence may strengthen
the forces on both sides that only want to prolong the status quo.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: Yesterday, you and other civil society leaders met with
United States Secretary of State Colin Powell. Can you describe what was
discussed?

A: First, Mr. Powell gave a statement about the American position
on the roadmap                                                 , trying
to give us confidence that the Americans are willing to work towards
this since the Iraqi war. They are pleased with the appointment of
[Palestinian Prime Minister] Abu Mazen and other things related to the
roadmap, but there are still things that remain to be done: in his
words, ""uprooting terrorism.""

He also said that that they asked the Israelis to implement their part,
to relieve the difficult conditions that Palestinians are suffering under.

Q: What about the Palestinian response?

A: For our part, we tried to express the difficulties of the
roadmap versus people's expectations that this time things might go
forward. There were several maps given to him, one showing Israeli
settlements and how they are dividing the country and depriving
Palestinians of their right to build a state that has continuity. The
settlements, in fact, are putting a final status agreement at risk and
our fear is that the transitional state that is part of the second phase
of the roadmap will also putting the final status at risk. The Israelis
might use this as a defacto final status, as was done during the Oslo
accords.

Also, there was another map that showed that settlements and bypass
roads [connecting the settlements] give continuity to the Israeli state
and integrate the settlements into Israel, which also threatens the
final negotiations. Another map on settlements showed that there are
some ""political settlements"" that might be dismantled in the first phase
[of the roadmap]. There are only 14,000 Israeli settlers living there,
but this would make a big difference [for us].

We worry about the relationship between democracy, and supporters of
peace who believe that Abu Mazen can deliver something. If their
expectations are not met, then they will be frustrated and believe there
is no future, which puts the peace process in danger.

Q: How did you feel these comments were received?

A: He didn't talk very much; he was mostly listening.

Personally, as I read the roadmap and compare it with the different
experiences that we have had--starting with Oslo, then the Wye River
Accords, and all these agreements, I feel that Palestinians are always
getting less than we had before. Palestinians always have to lower their
expectations. Who will be monitoring this situation? The partners are
not on equal ground.

Q: If you feel that the roadmap is just one more concession
by the Palestinians, do you think that Palestinians have any other
choice other than to work with it?

A: No. We are not rejecting the roadmap, but I cannot say that we
are accepting it as it is. If the roadmap is going to end the conflict,
there are some things that should be discussed. We have to look at the
implications of the establishment of the state of Israel on the
Palestinians. Just one of these implications was the creation of the
refugee problem. How can that be solved?

The people as a whole, as well as individuals, have a right to decide
what they want to do about this. If we take look at it from a
perspective of peace, then it is easy to solve the refugee problem
without endangering the state of Israel. Israel has to accept the right
of return, but the modalities of the right of return can be discussed.
Palestinians are still living as refugees, not only outside historic
Palestine, but there are also 22 refugee camps in the West Bank and
Gaza. These people live in misery.

How can we solve that problem, and that of the refugees in Jordan and
Lebanon and Syria? For 60 years, many of these people have been living
without citizenship and without rights.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: How do you explain the radical difference between the
fence decisions/recommendations of the Israel High Court of Justice
                                             and The Hague International
Court of Justice                                            ?

A: The subject we are dealing with is not purely judicial. As a
matter of fact, every judicial expert will tell you that you cannot
disconnect the judicial process from its social, human, and economic
environment. This is one of the cases that can demonstrate how two
independent judicial systems come to different conclusions based on the
same set of facts. The international court was constrained from the
beginning by the way the case was presented for its judgment. The
international court did not use the judicial tools that the Israeli
court used.

Q: Let's begin with the Israeli court.

A: The Israeli court used the mechanism of balancing between two
principles and rights. On the one hand, the right of Israel to defend
itself from terrorism, its right of self defense, and its humanitarian
approach that justifies measures in order to save lives--and there is no
doubt the fence has succeeded in saving lives. And on the other, the
fact that the fence caused inconvenience and damage and was a massive
intrusive element in the lives of groups of people. The question the
Israeli court dealt with was the best route to balance these two factors.

Q: And the international court?

A: The international court decided to concentrate on another issue
and deal with the fence through the question of the rights of an
occupying power. By ruling that Israel should destroy the present fence
and move it to the green line, the international court took a one-sided
and extreme decision that is political because it prefers the political
aspect over the security aspect.

Q: What could the Sharon government have done to prevent
the decisions?

A: Regarding the Israel High Court of Justice decision, they could
do nothing. Israel is a democracy committed to the rule of law, and High
Court decisions are binding for the government. In The Hague, Israel had
no chance of getting a fair and reasonable comprehensive approach to the
problem.

The whole idea of building the fence was a response to barbaric
terrorist acts. Around 1000 Israelis were killed and thousands wounded
before Israel started to build the fence. The court didn't mention this
and did not note the terrorist phenomenon, which was the only reason to
build the fence. As Israelis we can say that in spite of the
inconvenience and even humanitarian suffering that the fence has caused
to many Palestinians, it has saved hundreds of Israeli lives and the
same number of Palestinian lives: after, every suicide bomber succeeds
in taking Israeli lives, Israel responds by launching attacks on
Palestinian villages and terrorist centers that also take a toll in
Palestinian deaths.

Q: What can the Knesset and your committee do in the
current situation?

A: Our committee deals with many aspects of the Israeli presence
in the West Bank. We try to do our best to maintain human rights even in
the war against terrorism, and are supervising the conduct of the
Israeli security forces in the West Bank and trying to influence this
conduct according to morality and international law. When you are
fighting terrorism you face very complex dilemmas.

Now, after the courts have had their say, the issue becomes a political
one. We have to remember that the Israeli court decision is binding on
the Israeli government, but The Hague court decision is only a
recommendation and doesn't bind Israel. The decision will be transferred
to the international political arena, to the United Nations, presumably
by the Palestinians and their supporters. This is the next arena where
Israel will have to fight against the practical results, if there are
any, using political tools. I hope that the many democracies that
opposed or expressed reservations regarding The Hague judicial process
will now make more effort to block any attempt by the UN to impose
sanctions on Israel.

Q: Will the fence end up on the green line?

A: I don't think it's possible for Israel. The Hague court didn't
take into consideration the fact that there are many Jewish settlements
near the green line that Israel should protect. There are more than
100,000 Jews living on territory that, according to international and
Israeli law, is beyond the green line but is still under the authority
and jurisprudence of the State of Israel. Taking this position and
ignoring the political dispute is an attempt to isolate the judicial
process from real life on the ground; it risks the lives of more than
100,000 Jews that are living adjacent to the green line, for whom the
fence on its planned route is their only security guard.

We have to take into consideration that almost everyone in the area and
in the international community that has some involvement in the
continuous dialogue between the Palestinians and the Israelis knows that
under any final status agreement this dense Jewish population will be
included within the sovereignty of Israel. We are talking about
territories that constitute perhaps four or five percent of the West
Bank.
"
"Pal","Neut","Even prior to its ruling on the illegality of the wall, the
International Court of Justice (ICJ) was denounced by Israeli government
pundits as a ""kangaroo court."" After the ruling, one commentator opined,
""The court is biased,"" while another proudly proclaimed that the ICJ
decision                                             would ""find its
place in the garbage can of history."" The same stance was not, however,
taken with respect to the Israel High Court decison
                                            . Justice Minister Yosef
Lapid aptly summarized Israel's position on these two decisions: ""We
will comply with our High Court decisions, and not with the
International Court, whose decision is in any case a legal opinion for
the United Nations."" Herein lies the fundamental problem: Israel
reserves the right to act both as defendant and judge of any suit
against it and will not accede to independent adjudication of its crimes.

It would be easy to dismiss the decisions of the Israel High Court on
the basis of its track record. This is the same court that has failed to
outlaw completely the use of torture against Palestinians; legitimized
the presence of Jewish-only colonies built on stolen Palestinian land
(now a war crime under international law); and legitimized the
demolition of homes of suspected offenders and their families as a form
of punishment (a tactic also used by Saddam Hussein in Iraq).

Yet this decision of the Israel High Court should not be dismissed
outright. The court rightfully acknowledges that Israel is in
""belligerent occupation"" of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and correctly
demands that Palestinians be compensated for Israel's illegal actions.
In an eloquent statement, the court noted, ""Only a separation fence
built on a base of law will grant security to the state and its
citizens. Only a separation route based on the path of law will lead the
state to the security so yearned for.""

Remarkably, despite this statement, the High Court failed to do the very
thing that it was asked to do--determine a wall route based on the law.
Why? Not because of malice on the part of the court but due to the fact
that the court is, in essence, adjudicating the very crime that its
authorizing state claims is for its benefit. ""Our task is difficult,""
Justice Barak writes, ""We are members of Israeli society."" This
statement speaks volumes.

In determining what impact Israel's actions have on Palestinians, the
High Court examines only what is best for Israel (a country that was not
only built on the dispossession of others but has, for 37 years, tried
to expand its territory) and not the rights of the people subjugated by
Israel. In other words, the application of international law (with its
inherent principles of justice and equality) is optional, not obligatory.

Because the Israel High Court views international law as optional, it
fails to contest the military establishment's pronouncement that the
wall is necessary. More importantly, the High Court fails to adjudicate
the most important questions: Why has Israel not built the wall on its
pre-occupation border (the green line)--a shorter and more easily
defended line? What is the link between the wall and the colonies? If
the wall is truly about security, why will the proposed path of the wall
leave more than 200,000 Palestinians trapped between the wall and the
green line? It is therefore not surprising that the High Court only
confined itself to calling for moving (not removing) a mere 30 km of the
wall (less than 5% of the total length of the wall) because of the
""disproportionate injury"" caused to the Palestinians.

Juxtaposing the ICJ's decision with that of the Israel High Court, one
can clearly see the far-reaching power of an independent ruling based on
international law versus one based on domestic politics. The world court
correctly pronounced on the most basic (yet disputed) issues faced by
Palestinians: that Israel is, indeed, in occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip (which Israeli government officials cannot even acknowledge);
that the colonies are illegal, irrespective of whether they are in
Jerusalem or otherwise; and that Israel has flagrantly violated the law
for decades.

The world court went further than simply restating the law--it applied
it. By examining the current and proposed path of the wall, the 14-1
decision noted the following salient facts. The wall has been routed
around not only the colonies but also their planned expansion, in an
attempt to leave 80 percent of the settlers (320,000 Israelis) living in
the West Bank colonies. More than 200,000 Palestinians would remain
trapped between the wall and the green line. Of the more than
650-kilometer wall, only six percent (39 km) would be within 100 meters
of the green line. Over 16% of the western side of the Occupied West
Bank would be ""de facto"" annexed into Israel.

With these staggering facts, the ICJ could only conclude that the wall
built in occupied Palestinian territory is not there for military
necessity; it is there to consolidate Israel's hold on the colonies.
Though ""security"" is the proffered excuse, coveting Palestinian land
(and water) is the real reason behind the wall. Because the colonies are
illegal, so too is the very structure that is designed to ensure
Israel's hold on them--the wall.

Unlike the Israel High Court, the world court did not confine itself to
a mere 30 km stretch of wall. It demanded that Israel demolish the
entire wall built in occupied Palestinian territory; return the land,
orchards, and olive groves it seized to build the wall; and pay
compensation to Palestinians for all damages and losses.

The victory of the World Court decision lies not in the decision itself
but in the reframing of the conflict. No longer is this an issue of two
equal parties who cannot get along; it is about Israel's 37-year
military occupation and the inherent power imbalance. Many will dismiss
the case as ""non-binding,"" and indeed, the decision is non-binding.
However, the decision is based on law that is binding: UN resolutions
and international humanitarian law. Accordingly, the World Court's
ruling affects not only Israel but also the international community.

Israel has, for 56 years, viewed itself as above the law and the
Palestinians beneath it. That will not change. Israel will continue to
trample on the Palestinians' rights. It will continue to build
Jewish-only colonies on Palestinian land, and it will continue to build
the wall--unless it is stopped. The real test will be not what Israel
does but what the international community will do: will it apply the
power of law or the law of power?

I recently relayed to a friend Israel's labeling of the World Court as a
""kangaroo court."" ""If it is,"" he responded, ""it is only because even a
kangaroo would recognize that the wall is illegal."" It is a pity that
the Israel High Court did not.
"
"Isr","Neut","The dismissal of two Israeli scientists, Professor Gideon Toury and Dr.
Miriam Shlesinger from the editorial board of the periodical The
Translator in accordance with a boycott against Israel declared by
several hundred academics, has generated a renewed wave of comparisons
between Israel's policies and the policy of apartheid. The attempt
several weeks ago to legislate a law in the Knesset permitting the
construction of communities for Jews only also reminded many observers
of the ""whites only"" signs in South Africa under apartheid.

The comparisons, or course, are not new. We still recall the United
Nations General Assembly Resolution of 1975, ""Zionism = Racism =
Apartheid,"" which was cancelled by the same General Assembly 15 years
later. Even the map of areas A, B and C in the future Palestine provoked
waves of criticism because it reminded many in the world of the map of
Bantustans in racist South Africa.

The term ""apartheid"" has in recent years become synonymous with two
phenomena that at times do not even overlap. In the literal and perhaps
socio-geographic sense, apartheid means different categories of people
living separately by law. To some extent the American term ""segregation""
captures this meaning of the term ""apartheid."" In its second, more
political sense, apartheid means the perversion of the law that derives
from the brutal rule of a minority over a majority. White rule over the
blacks of South Africa from 1950 to 1994 is the clearest example of both
phenomena in the modern era.

Even without the aid of the two dismissed experts on translation,
Professor Toury and Dr. Shlesinger, we can now undertake a serious
attempt to analyze both usages of the term ""apartheid"" relative to the
Israeli-Palestinian context.

Regarding the first meaning of the term--living separately--we must
acknowledge that in the region between the Jordan River and the
Mediterranean Sea there is almost no motivation on the part of the two
communities, Jewish and Arab, to live together in terms of society,
culture and religion. For the most part they live separately of their
own volition and not because of legal compulsion, reflecting the two
communities' closed and conservative nature and their desire to preserve
their cultural and religious individuality. There is almost no joint
education for Jewish and Arab children and there are virtually no mixed
marriages. True, both establishments present administrative barriers to
socio-cultural integration, but it is important to note that the
establishments of both sides are involved here, and that there is a high
degree of cooperation between the two communities and their respective
establishments. The attempt by the Muslim Qaadan family to purchase a
home in the exclusively Jewish community of Qatzir (which gained
worldwide publicity and produced the abortive attempt to legislate
regarding Jewish communities) is not a common phenomenon in Israel.

Turning to the second meaning of the term apartheid, its political
context, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is near boiling point. There
are today some five million Jews and over one million Arabs inside the
1967 borders of Israel. In the Gaza Strip, West Bank and East Jerusalem,
which are intended for the future Palestinian state, there are some 3.5
million Palestinian Arabs and half a million Jews. In other words, in
the disputed territory between the Jordan and the Mediterranean there
are around 5.5 million Jews and 4.5 million Arabs. For the time being
this constitutes a clear Jewish majority inside Israel and a bare
majority throughout the entire territory.

Factoring in population growth trends, coupled with the near total
decline in immigration to Israel, we can project a situation of parity
between the two populations around 2010, and an Arab majority from the
second decade of the 21st century. In other words continuation of the
status quo, in which Israel exercises security--and in practice economic
and political--control over the entire territory, will place Israel in a
political apartheid situation in the Israel-Arab conflict in the
foreseeable future.

Since the clock is ticking, and bearing in mind that the current
Palestinian leadership has lost the confidence of the US administration
and the Israeli public as a consequence of the Intifada, the inclination
among Israelis toward separation from the Palestinians is in fact a
struggle against the gathering danger of political apartheid. At
present, political and physical separation (including the removal of
settlements beyond a fence) is the only way to avoid rule by a Jewish
minority over an Arab majority in just a few years. Accordingly, the
construction of that fence between Israelis and Palestinians should be
seen throughout the world as separation to prevent apartheid.

Linguistically this sounds absurd. But it is decidedly not absurd to
anyone who understands the reality of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
in 2002, and who wants the State of Israel to remain both Jewish and
democratic.
"
"Pal","Neut","When it is clearly time to work on laying the foundations of democracy
in Palestinian society (for this society has a clear stake in laying
these foundations--so do its neighbors and the world), the bargaining of
interests and powers is dictating a ""compromise."" Competing powers,
fighting over the Palestinian ""style of self determination,"" always
manage to reach a compromise that steps on the toes of democratization,
since democracy cannot compromise with the enforcement of something
against the will of a nation. This, unfortunately, happens to be the
history of Arab-Israeli struggle, of occupation, and of the ""war-like
peace process"" that Oslo turned out to be.

One of the problems of democracy is that it has not stopped being
nationalist by nature, and tends to be localized rather than global. In
practice, democracy controls relations within a state/society, but not
between nations. If national interest and democratic processes and
values come into contradiction, national interest dominates because of
democracy's localized nature. Hence, there can be nothing democratic in
a conflict, other than the democratically-made choice to be non-democratic.

The answer to the rhetorical question of whether it is easier for two
dictators to reach peace than it is for two leaders democratically
representing two nations is, unfortunately, not only rhetorical. On the
other hand, the harder choice (to make peace by democratic will) is the
more lasting one. But this choice presupposes the existence of two
democracies in a conflict, which cannot be the case when one nation is
subordinated to the other by occupation. This may explain why
decolonization is typically not a democratic process.

This was the case with each decolonized Arab Nation, throughout Africa,
and in Latin America. It seems that the effort put into the struggle
against occupation, the colonizers' destructive force, and the means
required to face colonial power and violence leaves societies with
political traditions, an economy, education, and set of values that make
it very hard to democratize.

We should also bear into account that democracy is not an automatic
choice. We should be able to imagine nations that would willingly choose
a non-democratic system for their lives. There are certain conditions
when democracy is ""the right choice"" for a nation. These conditions boil
down to the fact that people should have a stake in democracy, or else
some other system might happen to be more suitable for their lives.

The main interest at stake that democracy protects and sustains is power
to-be-shared and wealth to-be-distributed according to a certain social
contract. Hence, powerlessness, poverty and lack of sovereignty cannot
produce democracy. The lack of democracy, as a result, is not likely to
produce a sustainable peace. This logic leads to a well-known
conclusion: colonialism is a vicious circle for both the colonizer and
the colony. Both sides will pay a price for each day that passes without
breaking this vicious circle, although that price may be more affordable
than bloodshed, which will only grow and accumulate and be more
difficult to settle.

The mechanism of build-up for this vicious circle is blindness. The
seeking of revenge (hatred due to an emotional reaction to violence)
creates a situation where people tend not to see the long-term effect of
the damage on themselves, and the attention is deflected from the
original goals: parties tend to put more effort into harming the other
than into reaching their initial goals. If the political leadership
works only on the pulse of the street, it, too, becomes blind. (Note
that if it does not, it risks losing popularity.) This seems to explain
why damaging the future is the ""modus operandi"" of Middle Eastern
politics. It is a result of the shortsightedness or cowardly nature of
its political leaders.

What we need are leaders who are truthful enough and dedicated enough to
have a political vision of peace and justice, who are willing to lead
and then to give up their political careers for a while after signing a
genuine peace treaty that is designed to last. Only such a leadership
can lead the two nations of Israel and Palestine into genuine
democracies of the future, where the limits of the democratic system
extend further than those of the army.
"
"Isr","Neut","Because of the great size disparity between the Palestinian and the
Israeli economies, the character of the economic relationship between
them is of much greater importance to the Palestinians than to Israel.
Decisions regarding this relationship should, therefore, be left in
their hands.

In view of the short distances between the population and business
centers of the two parties, the length and geographically convoluted
nature of the border between them, and the fact that there has been no
customs boundary between them in the last three decades, the desirable
trade arrangement for the Palestinians seems to be a customs union. This
allows the free movement of goods between the two parties, unhindered by
any economic control or barrier, but also requires imports from the rest
of the world to be taxed at the same rates in both.

The high probability of Israel not admitting Palestinian workers in
large numbers in the foreseeable future lends great importance to the
substitution of exports of Palestinian labor by exports of goods
produced by this labor in the Palestinian economy itself, which a
customs union will facilitate marketing in Israel. The security barrier
now being established creates a physical border that also makes feasible
various degrees of economic separation, such as a free trade area
agreement (FTA), or even a trade regime that does not discriminate at
all in favor of imports from the neighboring country.

The sharp economic decline in the Palestinian territories since Oslo,
following the deterioration in the security situation, has given rise
there to the mistaken impression that the cause of the economic troubles
is the customs union set up by it. This impression was furthered by a
World Bank study that failed to separate the impact of the closures and
the security restrictions from that of the customs union itself. But
whatever the result of the Palestinian debate on this matter, the two
economies seem bound to drift apart in the future.

It is difficult to envisage today a reasonable mechanism for joint
decisionmaking, such as a customs union requires, that would be
acceptable to both sides. Furthermore, the mutual lack of trust and the
perceived power imbalance can be expected to result in attempts by
individual Palestinians to evade the agreed upon rules, provoking an
over-reaction of the Israeli customs authorities that will impede trade
flows. The experience of the past two years might also make the
Palestinian authorities prefer an arrangement that does away with
Israel's power to withhold from the Palestinian treasury the customs and
VAT revenues collected for it by Israel.

Economic separation might, however, have serious adverse effects on the
Palestinian economy, making it undesirable for both the Palestinians and
Israel. Even if the slide toward it is unavoidable, all effort should be
made to minimize the damage it causes. In principle, the security
barrier can be consistent even with a customs union. But in practice, by
raising the transportation and transaction costs of Palestinian exports,
it renders them less profitable.

There are, on both sides, those who welcome the setting up of a physical
border as providing the opportunity for establishing the permanent
economic relationship on an FTA basis. Such an agreement allows each
party to pursue its own customs and indirect tax policies, but exempts
from customs duties goods produced in the other one. The definition of
what constitutes local production for this purpose greatly restricts the
import component that can be embodied in it. Palestinian exporters can
be expected to encounter considerable difficulties in satisfying the
Israeli authorities? demand of proof that their merchandise fulfills
these ""rules of origin."" These difficulties cannot be dismissed by
arguing that a physical border in any case creates a trade obstacle, as
the costs of obtaining certificates of origin, of their examination and
of the verification of the goods conforming to them raises this hurdle
further.

But the greatest danger in turning the physical border also into an
economic one, even within an FTA agreement, is that it will invite
pressures for the further widening of economic separation. There are
those in both economies who wish to be protected from competition from
the other. In particular, for some years already there have been calls
in the Palestinian economy to impose protective tariffs on ""infant
industries,"" supposedly requiring a period of hothouse conditions to be
able to compete with Israel's. Such a step can be expected to raise a
demand for retaliation in the form of a protective tariff on Palestinian
goods, and pretty soon the FTA agreement might start to unravel in
practice, if not in theory.

There is no real alternative in sight today to the markets Israel
provided for the Palestinian economy. Restrictions on its access to them
are bound to take a heavy toll in poverty, misery and widespread
unemployment, making it imperative to minimize their scope.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: The original economic agreements between Israel and
the Palestine Liberation Organization were based on the idea of
integrating the two economies. In hindsight, do you feel that was a good
idea?

A: I think given the constraints at the time, there wasn't much
that we could have done better.

Q: When you look forward towards future negotiations,
then, do you see other arrangements being made?

A: There are several ways to improve on what was achieved in the
past, but we have to remember that the political setting has changed
immensely. The physical setting has also changed dramatically. I don't
think that we have arrived yet at the starting point for our future
discussions.

There are new realities on the ground and we will have to work a lot
harder and imaginatively to arrive at something tangibly different. But
that does not mean it will be better--it will be far more complicated,
far more security-oriented and definitely the magnitude of economic
relations between the two sides will be a lot smaller than it was years
ago.

Q: Can you give some concrete examples?

A: The most important components of economic cooperation between
Palestine and Israel during the past years, especially after Oslo, are
employment and trade. As you probably know, for several years after the
outset of the peace process, wage remittances contributed significantly
to the Palestinian income, at the rate of some 30 percent of the GNP.
Some 35 to 40 percent of the labor force was directly employed in
Israel. This is one area where we cannot go back to where we were. We
will have to try to structure or initiate some sort of labor relations,
but I do not expect the Israelis will accept a free flow of workers from
the Palestinian territories across the green line.

The same is true in regards to trade. For the past ten years or so,
Israel accounted for more than 90 percent of our exports. It was by far
the most important destination for our exports. Again, the security
implications of trade are important and I think that we will have to
structure these relations on new grounds. Definitely, it will be more
difficult to move commodities from the Palestinian territories to
Israeli markets.

Q: In terms of the customs relationship that has been in
effect, do you see that continuing despite the physical barrier that is
being constructed between the West Bank and Israel?

A: In theory, and even in practice in many countries, the mere
presence of a physical border does not imply that a customs union is
impossible. But I do not think that now we can realistically expect a
customs union in the near future.

On the other hand, both sides realize that trade between them is very
important. It is simply hard to do it. The question of security--or what
is described as ""security"", as the Israeli side has a terribly inflated
sense of what security means here--Israel can always say that because of
security, they cannot let this shipment through and so on. I think it
would be possible to have a new arrangement whereby the question of
security inspection is conducted by modern technology. Otherwise, one is
likely see a flow of goods in only one direction--from Israel to Palestine.

Q: In the short term, the restriction of movement, the
building of this wall, are all devastating the economy. Is there
anything that Palestinians can do themselves to alleviate this situation?

A: I think the question of the wall has not attracted adequate
attention at the international level. I think that Palestinians have to
struggle harder to oppose the wall. It is very clear that the wall is
not only a security invention, it is a political border that does not
coincide with the armistice line that was recognized as the dividing
line between the territories. The new wall is in several places several
kilometers east of the real border. We all know that the wall has been
installed taking into consideration political and economic and water
issues. I don't see any real reaction to the wall project at the
international level, in fact not even at the Palestinian Authority
level. They have to take it much more seriously and take it to the
Security Council.

Q: Can you give a general picture of the Palestinian
economy and where it is going?

A: We have all heard all kinds of figures about the economic
impact of the Intifada and the corresponding Israel sanctions. It is
quite clear that living standards have dropped dramatically.
Unemployment is in excess of 55 or 60 percent. Poverty is well in excess
of 60 percent and in Gaza, it must be in excess of 75 percent.
Businesses are in very bad shape and an increasing number are rendered
insolvent.

Banks are suffering and, despite the advantage of several years of good
business and huge reserves, they are now in very bad shape because of
the difficulties encountered by their customers. I am afraid that the
Palestinian banking system is literally shaking now. It would be a shame
if we witnessed a collapse of the banking system, like the private
sector at large. The Palestinian Monetary Authority is monitoring what
is going on and taking very tough measures, but banks are suffering and
if things stay as they are now--anything could happen.
"
"Isr","Neut","The belief in the need to impose a temporary government on the
Palestinians is based on the following judgments about underlying facts.

The existing regime by its nature--and as demonstrated by its
record--will never be interested in making a real peace with Israel
based on an acceptance of the legitimacy of two peoples with valid
claims to this land.

The existing regime is less concerned with the interests or wishes of
the Palestinian people than with its effort to destroy Israel, and will
resist with force any internal opposition or efforts at fundamental reform.

The deep corruption of the regime makes economic development virtually
impossible.

The regime's commitment to inciting hatred of Israel and Jews, through
lies and other deception, which is part of its strategy for staying in
power, is incompatible with movement to peace.

The regime is steeped in terrorism, which is criminal and unacceptable.
There is little room for separating internal terrorism from external
terrorism. The Palestinians must have a government that is not involved
in terrorism. There needs to be a clean break with terrorism.

Particularly because of the intensity of the conflict with Israel, and
the outside support that has been given the current regime, it is
essentially impossible for Palestinians to remove the current regime.
Potential opponents, or alternative leadership, will not come forward
until after Yassir Arafat and the current regime are removed.

What is needed is an outside group to organize a temporary government to
handle the day to day affairs of the Palestinians for an interim period
of something like three years, by analogy to the experience of Germany
and Japan after World War II. During this interim period the Palestinian
people could gradually develop civil and political institutions that
could begin a democratic political process to create a Palestinian
government that could negotiate with Israel. Meanwhile security
requirements will only permit arrangements that are much more burdensome
for Palestinians.

This discussion is based on the proposal made by Minister Natan
Sharansky summarized in his article, ""Where Do We Go From Here"" in The
Jerusalem Post on May 3, 2002. But other forms of this approach might be
as good or better.

Sharansky proposes that something like an Interim Palestinian
Administration (IPA) be created by a commission composed of the United
States and the Arab states that recognize Israel, excluding individuals
who have been involved in terrorist activities. The IPA will be
committed to freedom of expression and organization, to ending the
teaching of hatred and falsehood, and to ending the maintenance of
refugee camps designed to perpetuate grievances. While the
responsibilities of this interim administration would include normal
police functions, Israel would retain security responsibility and would
be expected to take whatever reasonable measures are necessary to
prevent attacks on Israelis. This enables the foreign governments to
avoid having to take responsibility for controlling Palestinian terrorism.

Today it is clear that the great majority of Palestinians support the
Palestine Liberation Organization/Palestinian Authority program of
terrorism against Israel, and its preference for a continuation of the
war over a two-state solution that fully accepts Israel. Palestinians
support Arafat against Israel--even though many have doubts about
various aspects of his regime. The idea of an interim administration is
that these popular Palestinian positions may also be partly the result
of the suppression of contrary opinion, frustration with a corrupt (and
partly ""foreign"") leadership, large scale incitement and teaching of
false information by official agencies and the controlled press, as well
as in the schools, and thus the absence of an open debate.

Also the current high level of hatred and desire to continue the
struggle to defeat Israel may be in part the result of natural anger and
resentment at the measures Israel is forced to take to prevent terrorist
attacks organized by the government, and the result of the hopes that
have been raised that Arab and European governments will prevent Israel
from protecting itself, and/or that division and weakness within Israel
will produce an Arab victory. Therefore it is thought that a clear end
of the current warfare, with the removal of the regime that initiated
it, and a period of open discussion, combined with an opportunity to
begin to build the Palestinian economy and civil society, free from
governmental domination, might lead to a different balance of opinions
among Palestinians and perhaps a greater chance for peace--as well as
more justice and hope for Palestinians and better living conditions.

Desirable peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinians, which
provide as justly as possible for the interests of both groups, can only
be implemented if there is a reasonable relationship between the two
populations and an important degree of mutual respect and trust. Most
Israelis believe that such a relationship can only be established if
there is a much greater degree of pluralism and open discussion among
Palestinians, and a Palestinian leadership that does not incite and
teach hatred of Israel. Such a relationship would also become much more
likely if there were a healthy Palestinian economy, which can only be
created if freed from political domination and corruption.

The approach presented here is only feasible if it becomes the policy of
the United States, and it will only become the policy of the United
States if there is a major change in official American thinking, a
change for which there already exists a good deal of support within the
US government.
"
"Pal","Neut","The lifting of the siege on the headquarters of Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat in Ramallah has coincided with an intensification of calls
for reform of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). These calls have
not been confined to Palestinian quarters but came also from top United
States leaders, including President George W. Bush and Secretary of
State Colin Powell and Israeli leaders, namely Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon. In recent weeks, the discourse of reform has become so crowded
with strains of ideas and aims that it is easy to lose one's way over
who wants what and why.

One thing can be quickly cleared up: Sharon, who has spent most of his
energy since his election as prime minister last year on demonizing and
dehumanizing Arafat and attempting to weaken, marginalize and possibly
destroy the PNA, cannot be said to be genuinely concerned with reforming
something he loathes so much. Sharon and his government have raised the
issue of PNA reform only after they failed to rid themselves of Arafat
and dismantle the PNA in their use of siege, blockade, assassinations of
Palestinian militants, and military invasion of towns, camps and
villages. Hence the current Israeli leadership is trying, as second
best, this new tactic aimed using the issue of reform to delay as much
as possible the rejuvenation of a process of political negotiations over
a final settlement.

What Sharon means by ""reform"" is a process of neutralizing Arafat. What
follows is the demand to allocate him only a symbolic role and leave the
real task of governing to other, perhaps more agreeable administrators,
as well as the unification of the several Palestinian security branches
into one. In other words, for Sharon and his right-wing Likud party and
many old guards of the Labor party, ""PNA reform"" means Palestinians
guaranteeing the security of Israel, including its occupying soldiers
and colonial settlers, before the reaching of a final settlement.

The United States is also demanding the unification of Palestinian
security forces, as well as a more financially transparent government
that is less centralized in the hands of Arafat. That is, the US
administration, in the best colonial tradition, is using reform as a
precondition for accepting the graduation of the PNA into statehood
(and, of course, without specifying borders and other characteristics of
statehood).

For Palestinians, the idea of reform is as old as the PNA, although new
advocates have emerged in the arena following the military reoccupation
of the West Bank. The newcomers to the reform platform are mostly from
the upper echelons of the PNA bureaucracy who are now on the bandwagon
for more than one reason; some have been recently genuinely shaken by
the price paid by Palestinians in the second Intifada. This group would
like to be part of the Palestinian decision-making process, and not
simply a cover for autocracy that is apportioned responsibility for
policies it has no hand in making, including the creation of a situation
that permitted the coexistence of a number of political centers with
their own autonomous strategies and tactics that have dramatically
effected the lives of large sectors of the population.

The main concern here has been the character of the confrontation with
the Israeli military occupation and colonial settlements. It has
centered on whether to develop and strengthen the popular character of
resistance, or to use armed struggle against the occupying Israeli army
and Israeli settlers, and whether to use suicide bombing of civilians
inside Israel, or a mixture of these. Each of these strategies has its
own impact on the Palestinian cause and society, as well as on the
Israeli political scene. The leadership of the PNA has no clear vision
for defining the limits of the competing strategies of Palestinian
political factions, which have resulted in a kind of chaos that has
negatively impacted most Palestinians.

It is difficult to clearly identify those Palestinian leaders who
genuinely stand for reform within the PNA hierarchy, since many of these
have other motives for calling publicly for reform. They have, no doubt,
benefited from existing PNA structures in terms of status, material
rewards and other privileges. By riding the reform wagon, a group of
upper PNA bureaucrats seeks to keep these privileges. They know that
reform is a winning internal and external ticket, but they are limiting
their program of reform to issues that do not threaten their interests,
for example, the unification or reduction in number of security
agencies, the reduction of the number of ministers from 30 to 15 or 18
and even the formation of a ""unity government"" or leadership. This is an
opportunistic position that plays to internal demands for reform and
simultaneously sends signals to the external sponsors of ""reform.""

For most Palestinians, on the other hand, reform of the Palestinian
political system is absolutely necessary for motives contrary to those
of Israel and the United States. Reform for them is envisaged as the
separation of powers, the promulgation of a modern constitution or basic
law and the holding of presidential, legislative and local elections. A
slimmer and more effective government with credible ministers also finds
strong support. In other words, reform is envisaged as an enabling
factor for better and more effective, as well as responsible resistance
to the Israeli occupation. Palestinians, as shown regularly by public
opinion polls, want democracy, transparency and an end to mismanagement
and corruption. But they also seek first of all an independent,
sovereign and democratic state of Palestine on all Palestinian territory
occupied by Israel in 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital and a
just and fair solution to the refugee problem in accordance with
international legitimacy.

"Isr","Neut","Q: In retrospect, was UNGAR 181
                                            a wise decision in your view?

A: From my point of view it was an inevitable decision. It
was in line with the solutions current in that period, the British
tradition of partition to resolve ethnic conflicts in India, Ireland,
etc. It was fashionable. It was inevitable because it was a legitimate
way of declaring war. The British left, knowing partition would not be
implemented, so UNGAR 181 legitimized the beginning of hostilities,
enabling the Jews to profit and get more than their share of Palestine.
Nothing of UNGAR 181 was implemented, not the borders, not the economic
union, not the provisions that safeguarded the interests of Palestinian
inhabitants on a par with Israelis; we tend to forget that within the
181 Jewish state there was an almost equal number of Arabs and Jews.
There were provisions to forbid confiscation of land. So UNGAR 181 was a
dead letter from the beginning. Later a myth developed that the Jews
accepted it and the Arabs rejected it. But the Jews never accepted to
honestly implement it. The main aspect of partition rejected by the Jews
was the internationalization of Jerusalem.

Q: Still, the Arab states officially rejected UNGAR 181.

A: This was their mistake. But this has become a myth to
buttress the justice of the Israeli clause, like the myth that Barak
offered the Palestinians everything at Camp David and they rejected it
and caused a war. So UNGAR 181 is an example of historic compromise only
in principle, not in reality.

Q: Are you arguing that the idea of partition into two
states was a mistake?

A: With hindsight the answer is no. Let's assume the United
Nations enforced the federation solution, the minority recommendation,
instead of partition. That would have been disastrous for the Jewish
people, there would have been no Jewish state, there would have been
one-man, one-vote.

Thinking about it today, with the failure of the idea of partition, now
that the demographic/ethnic proportions are the opposite of then (at
present Jews are a majority, then the Arabs were a majority), it's safer
to think in terms of a federated state or at least to give it a try. The
fashion is no longer partition. Then, after WWII, world borders were
fluid. Now the international borders are rigid, and the international
community is more prone to think in terms of soft internal boundaries
and federated states. So today maybe we should reopen the dilemma of
1947 and adjust it to the present situation.

Q: Were the 1947 borders--the Bosnia-like partition map of
interlocking cantons--viable?

A: They were not meant to be implemented. Especially in
Jerusalem, Jaffa, western Galilee--the triangles and points where the
cantons merged. Bosnia is a good example of a successful decision to
maintain old rigid international boundaries but with soft borders
inside. Had UNGAR 181 been implemented like at Dayton by the
international community after a terrible war it could have worked. But
this did not happen. Instead, the Jews saw UNGAR 181 as an opening to
legitimize their state and expand. Ben Gurion said as much: this is what
we take now.

So if you think in terms of bi-zonal confederation as in Bosnia or
Cyprus the answer is yes, the borders were viable. For this you need an
atmosphere of cooperation and agreement to demographic status quo and
this was not the case. Instead, one side (the Arabs) was weak and
militarily aggressive, while the other was dynamic, wanting to bring
millions of Jews to Israel, based on the UNGAR 181 foothold. The raison
d'etre of the Jewish acceptance of the partition plan was a Zionist plan
to expand. We should be proud that we strategically won that diplomatic
battle and made it the foundation of a state. But we did not, as the
myth says, accept a compromise while the other side rejected it. The
objective of UNGAR 181 was not to solve the conflict from the Jews'
point of view, but rather to create a Jewish state as a safe haven for
victims of the Holocaust. The rest is commentary.

Q: UNGAR 181 has returned to Israeli parlance in the last
few years, in the context of the peace process, because it provides the
international legal foundation for Israel as a Jewish state. Suppose the
Arabs had accepted it in 1947.

A: If we suppose the Arabs embraced UNGAR 181, this would
mean an internationalized Jerusalem, the 1947 borders, equal rights for
Palestinians in the Jewish state, near demographic parity, and Jews
forbidden to expropriate Arab lands. This is a typical ahistoric
question, because it is trying to invoke something that was meant to
deal with an entirely different situation of 57 years ago, so much so
that in 1948 people like me were for partition, and now we support a
federated state--just to show how things have changed.

"Pal","Neut","UN General Assembly Resolution 181
                                            was passed in November 1947.
The first internationally accepted partition plan of Palestine
apportioned the land in about equal measure to a future Palestinian-Arab
state and a Jewish state, both of which were to have consisted of three
cantons, Jerusalem would have been under international administration,
and the two states would have economic unity, including a common currency.

The British government called in the UN to settle the ""question of
Palestine"" in 1947. The British took the issue before the General
Assembly as a conflict between two communities, the Arab Palestinians
and the Jews. In doing so, they presented the British Mandate Authority
as neutral. In fact, their hope throughout this period was that the
General Assembly would prolong the British mandate.

The UN decided to hold a special session devoted to the issue in April
1947, a meeting that resulted in the advent of the UN Special Commission
on Palestine (UNSCOP). UNSCOP was comprised of representatives from 11
member states and came to Palestine in July 1947 to meet all the
concerned political parties. The Palestinian side boycotted the
commission, a position imposed by the then Palestinian leadership under
Haj Amin al Husseini. As a result, no single Palestinian faction met the
commission, although the Arab Liberation League (ALL), the forerunner of
the Palestinian Communist Party, had intended to. Under pressure, the
ALL changed its mind on the pretext that it did not want to cause any
split in the national ranks at that critical time. The party did,
however, send a memorandum to the UN entitled ""The Way to Freedom for
Palestine"" describing the situation as it saw it.

At the beginning of September 1947, UNSCOP came out with its
recommendations. The majority suggested partition, while the minority
opinion wanted a single democratic Palestinian state for Arab
Palestinians and Jews. On November 29, the General Assembly adopted the
majority partition plan.

Not long after the resolution was adopted, violence erupted between the
Palestinian and Jewish communities. This violence was provoked and
encouraged on the one hand by the British Mandate Authority, still
hoping to prolong its mandate, and by a well-prepared and well-equipped
Zionist movement on the other. The Palestinian leadership played its own
not insignificant part.

The British took certain measures to intensify the clashes. On January
15, the British Mandate Authorities shut down Al Ihtihad newspaper, the
paper of the ALL. Al Ihtihad was the only newspaper that had foreseen
the likely outcome of the violent confrontations. In its articles and
editorials, the paper worked to prevent the Palestinian people from
taking part in the confrontations, and advocated acceptance of the
partition plan. Even though Palestinians felt the plan to be unjust, the
paper reasoned that to have an independent democratic state in part of
Palestine would be better than to have no state at all. It also saw
acceptance of UNGAR 181 as the only way to avoid what was to become the
Palestinian catastrophe: the exile of over half the Palestinian people
from their homeland.

The party the paper represented only followed belatedly. In February
1948, the Arab Liberation League changed its long-standing position in
support of one democratic state for Jews and Palestinians alike, and
adopted the partition plan. It was the only Palestinian party to
formally accept UNGAR 181. The rest of the Palestinian factions were
under the tight control of a conservative and autocratic Haj Amin al
Husseini, who had always advocated an independent Palestinian Arab
state, where the Jews present before 1918 and their descendants had a
right to stay because of their ancestry while those who arrived later
would have to return to their countries of origin.

It came down to pragmatism. The Zionist project was a colonialist
project. The 1917 Balfour declaration and the subsequent immigration
into Palestine had as its explicit aim to create an alien entity in
Palestine at the expense of the indigenous population. In principle it
was wrong for Palestinians to go along with it in any way, shape or
form. In practice it might have avoided the Nakba that Palestinians are
still suffering from today.

But despite its pragmatic stand, the British authorities took
administrative measures to shut al Ihtihad down, and only five days
later, on January 20, the British government declared it would give up
all its security responsibilities, urging both sides to take measures to
defend their respective communities. It was a clear indication that the
British would not stand in the way of the violence. The British were
hoping that a conflagration of the violence would force the UN to extend
the British Mandate.

On September 16, 1948 Count Folke Bernadotte, who had been mandated by
the UN to mediate a solution between the warring factions based on UNGAR
181, publicized his report. He proposed to redistribute the territory,
with the Negev becoming part of an Arab state, crucially not a
Palestinian state, but a greater Jordanian one, while the Galilee would
become part of a Jewish state. It was a plan that would have suited the
British well, providing territorial contiguity between the Suez Canal
and Jordan all of which was under British control. But the plan never
came to fruition and Bernadotte was assassinated the very next day,
apparently by Jewish terrorists under the leadership of Yitzak Shamir, a
later Israeli prime minister. UNGAR 181 finally died with the Swedish
envoy.

While no one talks of UNGAR 181 any longer, lessons have been drawn from
the experience. Most importantly, during the 19th session of the
Palestinian National Council in Algiers in 1988 the Palestinian
leadership adopted the so-called declaration of independence envisaging
a state on the land occupied in 1967. Considering that that land is less
than half of the land promised a Palestinian state by UNGAR 181 the
decision was a very serious compromise in favor of peace.

The Palestinian people have also learned from the period that their
greatest weapon is their presence. Israel has always wanted the land
without the people. That is the single most important reason the
territories occupied in 1967 were not annexed. Only east Jerusalem was
annexed, at a time when the Palestinian population of this ""unified
Jerusalem"" constituted 27 percent of the total population. Despite the
best attempts of the Israeli authorities and the influx of new Jewish
immigrants, Palestinians now constitute 33 percent of the city.
"
"Isr","Neut","When important people die it is customary to remark that a chapter has
been closed in the life of the collective they led and within which they
acted. In many cases this is an empty phrase; in Yasser Arafat's case it
is precise. For better or for worse, the fate of the Palestinian people
was embodied in him. Because so many things were dependent on him, his
death creates a new reality.

Arafat leaves behind a Palestinian people embroiled in an armed
intifada, with a weak Palestinian Authority, chaos in the West Bank and
Gaza, Hamas gaining strength and Fatah wracked with dissent. But he also
leaves Palestinians with international standing, general recognition of
the necessity of solving their problem, a bureaucratic establishment
built in the territories in recent years in anticipation of statehood,
and a readiness--even on the Israeli right--to acquiesce to the
establishment of a Palestinian state.

Arafat agreed, albeit with many reservations, to the Clinton Plan of
January 2001 and without reservations to the Quartet's roadmap. He
bequeaths those understandings to the leadership that will replace him,
which accordingly will not have to confront the need to break any
political taboos. Recognition of Israel, agreement on a Palestinian
state within borders based on the 1967 lines, a readiness to recognize
Israeli sovereignty over Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, the
Jewish quarter of the Old City and the Western Wall--all these can now
be converted into assets by a Palestinian leadership that seeks peace.

Arafat--the statesman and the terrorist, the man who came to the UN
General Assembly with a gun and an olive branch, who spoke of martyrs
and of jihad but also of the peace of the brave--provided the ultimate
legitimacy to the Palestinians, even to those who did not support him
and to Islamic extremists who resolutely opposed him. He did not use his
authority to make peace, but his followers can exploit the political
concessions he made when they feel strong enough to lead a dramatic new
departure.

Israel will be making a terrible mistake if it stands idly by and waits
to see how Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas), Abu Ala (Ahmed Qurei) and their
associates deal with the new reality. If it has any interest in
strengthening the pragmatic Palestinian camp it must start talking as
early as possible with the Palestinian Authority about the planned
withdrawal from Gaza; it must return to the negotiating table and begin
to implement the roadmap. Ceasing targeted killings, reducing
roadblocks, easing the life of Palestinians, releasing prisoners--all
these acts will strengthen the new leadership without compromising their
status. Sharon is well aware of this; if he didn't understand it on his
own, he was enlightened by the IDF chief of staff, who didn't hide his
view on the way we failed to capitalize on Abu Mazen's tenure as prime
minister.

The Bush administration, which has high regard for Abu Mazen and an
interest in his success, must now update the roadmap and reinvigorate
it. It makes no sense for everyone to swear by the roadmap, which speaks
of a final status agreement in 2005, but for President Bush to
officially announce that that date is not realistic. An agreed Israeli
withdrawal from Gaza must be integrated immediately into the roadmap,
and a new and realistic timetable established, in order for the two
sides to return to the negotiating table and complete the task that was
interrupted at Taba in January 2001. The goal is an agreement modeled
after the Clinton Plan, the Bush vision and the Geneva accord.
"
"Pal","Neut","Most nations have heroes who occupy a central place in their national
narrative. Heroes are made, and remade, especially after their death.
Arafat was already well on his way to becoming a Palestinian icon during
his life. These processes will be completed soon after his death.

Yet what he ultimately stood for will be contested. His legacy will be
claimed by different groups and parties, including those who opposed him
politically at some point or another, and by various factions within his
own party, Fateh. Arafat will continue to play a political role after
his death.

For in spite of his long career, his death clearly portrays an
unfinished journey: he died in Paris; official ceremonies were held in
Cairo and not in Palestine, and he was buried ""temporarily"" in Ramallah.
Any final peace agreement between Palestinians and Israelis will have to
allow for an appropriate final resting place for Arafat in Jerusalem.

It is also clear that Palestinians will be entering a new phase in their
political life. Two broad issues will dominate in the near and longer
term: the fate of the political process with Israel, and the nature of
the Palestinian political system in the post-Arafat era.

Initial assessments made soon after Arafat's death about possibilities
now open for progress in negotiations with Israel have a short-term
focus but no strategic significance. For even if one were to suppose
that another interim arrangement is made between the new Palestinian
leadership and the Israeli government, the seeds of conflict will
remain, all the more so because of the separation wall that will become
a focus for continued protest and resistance.

The new Palestinian leadership may have some political leeway in the
immediate future to continue steps started by the intercession of Egypt,
especially if there is a higher degree of American and European
involvement. Ultimately, however, gradual political restraints will be
placed on the new leadership due to the increased political influence of
varied contenders for power who will assume a more prominent role after
the death of Arafat. In his lifetime, he could not be challenged on
power sharing by other groups. The new Palestinian leadership will be in
a far weaker position in the face of such demands and ultimately may
have to accede to them, at least partially.

But the main longer-term constraint and challenge for any new
Palestinian leadership is whether it may possibly have an Israeli
partner in any future government of Israel. There is no reason to
believe that such a leadership will be able to ""sell"" to Palestinians
what an Israeli government is likely to offer. The internal Israeli
political scene will remain deadlocked on the issue of where to draw the
line territorially for the end of the Zionist project in historic
Palestine unless there is consistent outside pressure that could
influence Israeli public opinion in a leftist direction. This does not
appear likely under the Bush administration. Any interim arrangement
will therefore keep the seeds of conflict smoldering.

The nature of the political and administrative system of the Palestinian
Authority after Arafat is the second main challenge where changes are to
be expected. As most Palestinians agree, no one person will be able to
replace Arafat. In addition, he created under the PA a
de-institutionalized mode of government where the informal system
predominated over the formal system. His system of patronage and
clientism tied ultimately to himself resulted in his being the glue that
bound the system. His departure may well result in the fragmentation of
his own party, Fateh, and various centers of power in the PA as well.

The new leadership is very keenly aware of this, but it remains to be
seen how successful it will be in holding things together in the coming
weeks and months. Centralizing the various security services under one
command will not by itself be enough. This is an Israeli requirement but
is not the only element of reform required from a Palestinian point of
view. Without rule of law and a reformed court system, there is a danger
that Palestinians will be governed by security organizations. In terms
of priority, rule of law comes first.

Beyond a short transition period, the issue of the legitimacy of the
government will come up. The demand for elections has already been
raised in the past year and more persistently than at any time before.
If elections for a new representative council are not held soon, the
legitimacy of the government will be undermined and wide rifts in
society will open. The new leadership will be too weak to stem what will
be a swelling tide. This will also be a political decision that Israel
and the US will have to take, i.e., whether to facilitate elections or not.

Ultimately, issues related to reform and democratization in the
Palestinian context will not be separate from issues related to national
rights. No Palestinian leadership will be able to govern democratically
if it is perceived by Palestinians to be making undue concessions on
such rights. This will also be seen as the heritage of Arafat who died
while under siege in Ramallah. His burial site will remain a potent,
visible, and concrete reminder.
"
"Isr","Neut","The end of the Arafat era presents unprecedented opportunities for
change both in Palestinian society and for relations with Israel. But
progress depends on the nature of the new Palestinian leadership, and
the range of plausible scenarios extends from chaos, civil war and
""Hamastan"", to a democratic government promoting pragmatic compromise.

Compared to Arafat, the team of Mahmoud Abbas and Ahmed Qurei presents
an image of responsibility and pragmatism, without embracing ""martyrdom""
and incitement. Although both were close associates of Yasser Arafat
during decades of terror, and Abbas once promoted Holocaust denial, in
the past two years he criticized Arafat's policy of violent
confrontation, albeit for pragmatic rather than moral reasons. Under
their leadership, the first few weeks of the transition were relatively
calm, with limited internal violence and no suicide attacks against
Israeli civilians, although the potential for terror and violence
remains high, as reflected in the December 12 bombing of an IDF outpost
in Gaza along the Egyptian border. In response to the overall improved
atmosphere, Israeli security forces took steps to lower friction. This
is still a long way from stability and an end to four years of terror
and response, but such steps at least point in the right direction.

The presidential elections scheduled for January 9, 2005 will mark an
important milestone in expanding this hopeful beginning. This is an
entirely Palestinian affair, and Israeli involvement to promote a
particular outcome would be counterproductive. But Israelis are not
indifferent--the results will have a major impact, and could mark the
first real example of Arab democracy in action. However, if Abbas and
the Fateh organization manipulate the process to ensure continued
control, they will lack the legitimacy necessary to bring stability to
Palestinian society. This will also prevent firm action to end
rejectionism and violence, including dismantling of terror organizations
such as Hamas and the Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.

>From this perspective, Marwan Barghouti's on-again off-again candidacy
added an extra complication. Before Barghouti's central involvement in
the terror campaign (for which he was convicted by an Israeli court on
five counts of murder), he was seen by many as the best hope for
transforming Palestinian society. Unlike Abbas and Qurei, who lived with
Arafat in Tunis before the Gaza process, Barghouti was a local leader of
the 1987 intifada, and has many years of pragmatic experience in dealing
with the realities of Israeli society. Barghouti's youth and charisma
contrast sharply with the ""grayness"" of the old Fateh leadership, which
is also heavily tainted by the graft and corruption characteristic of
Arafat's inner circle.

But Barghouti is in jail, closely associated with the past four
traumatic years of violence and extremist rhetoric. No conceivable
Israeli government will negotiate with a murderer convicted through due
process of law, and a politically based amnesty is not on the agenda.
Thus, a Barghouti victory would have frozen hopes for renewing the
dialogue aimed at political compromise.

Barghouti's candidacy was also an expression of Palestinian political
demands for the release of terrorists in Israeli jails--a position that
is unacceptable to the majority of Israelis. During the Oslo period,
there were a number of instances in which Israel agreed to release
prisoners responsible for terror waves, only to see the former prisoners
launch more attacks. Israelis also dismiss attempts to portray Barghouti
as the Palestinian Nelson Mandela (a title once given to Arafat) as part
of the broader political strategy aimed at delegitimizing Israel as an
""apartheid state"". This is simply rejectionism in a different package.

Another important factor is the degree of participation, which is
relevant to the question of legitimacy. If Hamas and other radical
groups do not participate, and the Fateh organization uses the elections
to maintain control in a closed system following the standard Middle
Eastern ""pseudo democratic"" model, there is no chance for real change.
In such a scenario, an Abbas victory could simply serve to resume the
violent power struggle between the different factions, with little
ability to move out of Arafat's shadow on core issues such as refugee
claims and Jerusalem, even in the long term.

Thus, although the post-Arafat era and the Palestinian elections offer
the possibility for important and positive change, this outcome depends
on overcoming major obstacles.
"
"Pal","Neut","The death of the historical leader Yasser Arafat has left a dangerous
political vacuum that the Palestinian people now have to find the best
possible way to fill. Presidential elections are one of the ways being
pursued to fill this vacuum and to establish a new source of legitimacy
for a Palestinian leadership, whether from Arafat's party (Fateh) or
from outside it.

Arafat, who did not care much about involving the political institutions
in the decision-making process, owed much of his legitimacy to his
charisma, his use of symbolism and his populism. His charisma was in
large part due to his ability to be one of the people: he lived a
spartan lifestyle and spoke to people in a language shorn of any
affectation. His life was representative of the suffering of the
Palestinian people: he, as they, was exiled from one Arab city to the
other and marginalized and persecuted by all Arab regimes. He was also
adept at using symbolism: the kefeyya, the military uniform, and the
discourse of pain, sacrifice and return all resonated strongly with
millions of Palestinian refugees and exiles. After his return to the
homeland, Arafat did not try to change the basis of his legitimacy and
was thus not interested in building viable Palestinian political
institutions. The lack of such institutions explains why his death
caused such anxiety among the Palestinian people.

Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), who is part of the remaining historical
leadership, has not got, and seemingly does not want, the same sources
of legitimacy as Arafat. Abbas speaks his mind even if it isn't popular;
he avoids symbolism and dresses in a western-style suit. A wealthy man,
he does not pretend to represent those who suffer among the poor. He
wants to base his legitimacy on general suffrage, or sound democratic
rules, and the involvement of political institutions, in particular
those of Fateh. As a strategy to deal with the Israeli occupation, he
advocates negotiations and does not offer an alternative should such a
strategy fail to achieve national aspirations.

Abu Mazen has been strongly challenged by a younger leader whose appeal
rests on similar bases to Arafat. Marwan Barghouti presents himself, not
only as the representative of the poor and marginalized refugees, but
also of the historically neglected peasants from whose ranks he comes.
His flamboyant discourse of challenge, resistance, sacrifice and
negotiation resembles that of Hamas, but with secular connotations. This
discourse finds a ready audience among poor youth, in particular those
in Fateh who have often been treated as mere fuel for the maneuvers of
the political leadership.

Even though Barghouti has now stood aside, he nevertheless represents a
strong political current within the ranks of Fateh. His is the Fateh of
the masses as opposed to the Fateh of the elite; the Fateh youth versus
Fateh's historical leadership; Fateh the militant versus Fateh the
diplomat; and Fateh the poor versus Fateh the rich.

And in an attempt to win the internal battle between the two Fatehs and
challenge the traditional leadership by bringing into question their
legitimacy within the party, Marwan is calling for internal Fateh
elections at all levels. He is thus using the presidential election as a
form of primary for the contest within Fateh, and in doing so
highlighting the fact that Fateh's ""official choice"" to run for
president (Abu Mazen) did not undergo a rigorous process of selection
from among the party's base. He acts as a reminder to the national
political institutions and representatives that their legitimacy derives
from their popular base--an important contribution to the Palestinian
political system.

The harsh reaction of ""official"" Fateh against Marwan's candidacy would
seem to be an attempt to undermine those who want to establish their
legitimacy on a sound democratic basis. The desire to represent Fateh
with one voice is essentially undemocratic. The party has different
political currents within it. Allowing these differences to surface, in
this case through a second presidential candidate, is a healthy
democratic step, though it may be destructive to the party itself.

Furthermore, sound popular backing will importantly provide the elected
leader greater legitimacy to face the coming regional and international
pressures. This will be necessary in any dealings with Israel, which is
adept at using the ""threat"" of a strong right wing to tie the hands of
Israeli negotiators and shrug off international pressure. That is also a
reason the traditional practice of downplaying differences within Fateh
might not be the best way to deal with internal opposition.

Outside Fateh, the withdrawals of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the PFLP from
the presidential race leave more room to independents. Mustapha
Barghouti portrays himself as the representative of a 'third way',
neither political Islam nor Fateh's mainstream nationalism. Instead,
Barghouti, aware of the importance of the discourse of resistance and
sacrifice, seeks to build his source of legitimacy on non-violent
popular resistance as manifested in the mobilization against the Israeli
separation wall. Understanding also the importance of the role of
international public opinion, Barghouti has highlighted his ability to
address that sector, on the formal and informal levels, as a way to
boost his domestic standing and in an attempt at building a power base
among the ""silent independents"" and the youth, as well as those
dissatisfied with Fateh or Hamas' policies, whether they be in the
business sector or professionals.

Barghouti is also taking a leaf out of Hamas' book. By utilizing
networks he developed from his work in the Medical Relief Committees, an
influential NGO in the health provision sector, Barghouti hopes to
transform his erstwhile service recipients into an organized
constituency. It is important to note that the bureaucracy, networks,
leadership and strategy needed to run an NGO are different than those
needed to build a political movement or organization. The latter is
based on shared goals, voluntarism, sustainable commitments and
well-coordinated collective action. If he is successful in this project,
Barghouti's example might set an important precedent for the many NGOs
in the Arab world to transform themselves from urban elite NGOs into
popular movements, whether social or political ones. In doing so, they
may be finally able to obtain some real political power and compete with
both the Islamic movements and ruling parties.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: How would you describe the development of
Israeli-Palestinian strategic relations? What turning points have there
been?

A: The first turning point was the Oslo agreement of September 1993,
when the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] was co-opted as a
negotiating partner. This was a mistake, because the PLO represents the
Palestinian diaspora, and Arafat is incapable of giving up the right of
return. The Oslo process has made everyone, Israelis and Palestinians,
worse off, and has caused terrible suffering. Next came September 2000,
when Arafat in effect launched a war against Israel. This was followed
on February 6, 2001 by Sharon's overwhelming victory over Barak.
Finally, September 11, 2001 was a crucial turning point in reducing
Arafat's centrality; he has lost considerable support in the
international community, especially the US.

Q: The interception of the Karine A Palestinian gunship was
not a turning point?

A: No, it was a further indication that Arafat is bent on war
against Israel and that telling the truth is not one of his attributes.

Q: You recently wrote that for Israel now to refrain from
scoring a decisive victory over the Palestinian Authority-including
going into the Palestinian cities and disarming the PA-would be similar
to the mistake the first Bush administration made in 1991 when it
avoided conquering Baghdad and eliminating Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
But how do you deal with the downside: reoccupying three million angry
Palestinians, possible hostile reactions by Egypt, Jordan and others,
the American and UN reactions, the lack of consensus among the Israeli
public?

A: On balance, Israel will be better off if those hostile
Palestinians don't have weapons and Hamas can't launch operations. There
is no substantial danger from Egypt and others; the military balance of
recent years provides us with significant deterrence. Nor am I concerned
about the Israeli consensus; Sharon won by a 25 percent margin. Besides,
we are not talking about permanent reoccupation, but rather a temporary
move to disarm the PA. A decisive defeat will cause Arafat to lose support.

Q: Yet Sharon avoids doing this. Does he have such a mandate?

A: Sharon is creeping in that direction, accelerating since
September 11 with US and other international support, accustoming the
international community to what needs to be done. In truth, I don't
think that's a good way of doing it, but he's moving in that direction.
His mandate is the rejection by a very large majority of Israelis of the
underlying assumptions of the Oslo accord and of Arafat as a peace
partner, and support for more and more active measures. But calling
Arafat ""irrelevant"" was a mistake, a misuse of the word.

Q: How do you envisage the Israeli-Palestinian strategic
relationship after such a decisive Israeli victory? How will this
contribute to a peace process?

A: Such a move is a prerequisite for Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations that have a chance for positive results. As long as the
Palestinians believe in using violence to obtain objectives, no useful
negotiations can take place. We saw this with Egypt after 1973, when it
realized that violence as an option had spent itself.

Q: But Egypt was not decisively defeated in 1973, so how does
the analogy hold?

A: In the final analysis an Egyptian consensus emerged from the Yom
Kippur War that they could achieve nothing by force, even if they saw
themselves as victors. This is the model for Israeli-Palestinian
relations after an Israeli decisive victory: we must persuade the
Palestinians that the option of force won't work, that they cannot
attain their objectives this way.

Q: Who are the Palestinian candidates to talk to us on this
basis after our decisive victory?

A: If there is a chance, it's with local Palestinians, and over a
long period of time. I don't know if there's a cadre of Palestinians who
will negotiate under these conditions. I only know that this is a
necessary condition. I hear from our intelligence community that there
are such Palestinians around Arafat. But I acknowledge that recently
Palestinian extremists have gained more public support. In any event, I
don't believe in our manipulating the Palestinian public scene. Our
first objective is to save the lives of Israelis after some 250 losses.
If we disarm the Palestinians this will be a very significant step. If
it then turns out that nobody is prepared to talk to us, it's still a
net gain.

Q: Assuming some ""insider"" Palestinians are prepared to
negotiate a settlement after an Israeli decisive victory, what would
that settlement look like? What would you offer them?

A: This is not a question that should be asked of an Israeli
politician, who should not tell you now what he's going to offer in
negotiations that may or may not take place a few years from
now.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: Are Palestinians and Israelis undergoing a strategic
change in their relationship?

A: I think that with the kind of attitudes that the current
Israeli government is taking towards the Palestinian Authority,
reviewing their partnership and Oslo [peace agreements] and the PA, this
is an indication that we are on the verge of reviewing an already
changing strategic relationship.

Q: Is that trend towards the right superficial or a serious
change with drastic implications?

A: Israeli society in general has a deep propensity towards the
right. The right is linked to the notion of the existence of Israel and
this cuts across a broad base in Israeli society. Israelis, every time
they feel that there is a threat of one sort or another, drift towards
the right. There is a sense of entrenchment. The right has better
articulations and premises when it comes to the sense of entrenchment
and how to preserve the state of Israel.

Unfortunately, this current Israeli government has played on the
existential fears of Israelis and managed to drag them more and more to
the right. Remember, [Israeli Prime Minister Arial] Sharon said that he
would ensure the individual and collective security of the Jewish people
in Israel. But under his rule, there have been more casualties and
security problems than under any other Israeli prime minister. Still,
there is a drift to the right and unprecedented support for him, despite
his evident failure in preserving the security of the Jewish people.
This can happen only if you manipulate the fears of the Jewish people.

Q: What will change this drift?

A: It requires a number of things. First of all, we need a
historic Israeli leadership, a responsible leadership, a leadership that
will be able to identify the roots of the problem and not just
manipulate the symptoms and side effects. A leadership that would
recognize the roots of the matter in a just political settlement through
which the Palestinian people are recognized as equal and their rights
are recognized and addressed.

I don't think that this Israeli government is capable or is interested
in restoring the moral, balanced nature of Israeli society because that
would run counter to its scheme of things. The other factor is the
political settlement itself. If there is a political settlement through
which people feel that their rights and security are addressed, one that
would allow for healing the broken confidence between the two people,
this too would help to restore this kind of balance in Israeli society.

Q: How should Palestinians face the strategic change in the
Palestinian-Israeli relationship?

A: The margin that Palestinians have is very minimal. The
Palestinians cannot change when they are already settling for the bare
minimum that is needed for their national and material existence and
their national and material continuity. What kind of strategic changes
can they make with regard to Israel when they have already accepted
agreements and fulfilled commitments from the point of view of the
international community?

I don't think that they can respond to every unrealistic demand of
pretext that is made by Sharon and his government, demands that are
meant to undermine the Palestinian national existence and devoid the
peace process of any substance. I don't think the Palestinians are
capable of making any strategic change. In what direction? For what
reason? Their only strategic choice is to reach a settlement to this
problem with Israel through which they can regain their national rights
and live in peace with Israel, according to the bases and parameters set
by the international community--Resolutions 242 and 338 and other
principles for peacemaking.

Q: Israelis would say that if that is the case, Palestinians
should have accepted the offers of Camp David.

A: In appearance, Camp David satisfied the bare minimum, but if
you analyze it carefully, it doesn't. We are still suffering from a
vague and unfair agreement, the Oslo agreement, and we don't want to
repeat that by accepting an agreement that is not clear and does not
address the main issues of Jerusalem, the refugees, borders,
sovereignty, etc. One should not fall for Israeli propaganda that says
the Palestinians rejected 95 percent [of the West Bank]. In fact, no
issue was conclusively resolved with the Israelis. Not one single issue.

Palestinians cannot change their strategic option because their national
and material existence hinges on the kind of strategic option that they
have chosen since the beginning of the peace process. Part of this
strategic option is their commitment to the bare minimum of national
rights that enjoy Palestinian consensus--a Palestinian state within the
borders of 1967, with Arab Jerusalem as its capital; settlements as
illegal and removed and refugee problems addressed according to
Resolution 194 without prejudicing the integrity of the Jewish state.
The Israelis object to this principle because it means the undoing of
the state of Israel. We say, ""No, we can exercise this principle in a
way that does not undermine the integrity of the Jewish state.""

Q: Is there a military option?

A: No, this is a tactic. The Palestinians in 1988 abandoned the
military option and they committed themselves to a political settlement
and this is how the PA was established. If Palestinians have resorted to
certain options because they were squeezed into the corner and subjected
to excessive use of power and military harassment and they saw that the
only way to defend themselves was by the military means available to
them, this is another issue. This is not a strategic option.
"
"Isr","Neut","The only logical way to read the Sharm al-Sheikh summit is in accordance
with the recommendation of Ariel Sharon: ""only actions and not
words--this is the only way to attain the vision of two states"". We must
judge by facts on the ground and not by the verbal promises that were
disseminated. If this lesson has not been learned from the Oslo years
with their stream of promises of peace and prosperity for two states,
then why waste words?

The summit produced an admission of fatigue on the part of both sides,
however asymmetrical they are--fatigue from the bloodletting. The summit
itself featured an attempt at chumminess (Sharon inviting himself to
Ramallah, joking with Abu Ala about the fence at Abu Dis, etc.) that
created the appearance of parity between two equal antagonists who
promise from herein to behave themselves. But the moment mortar shells
began falling on the Qatif Bloc, we returned to the language of ""you'll
be sorry"" and the clank of tank treads. These admonitions brought us
back to the summit's real point of departure in Israeli eyes: the
Palestinians are the aggressors; they started it. Abu Mazen rose to the
challenge. He knows that the weak Palestinian position requires him to
act like the aggressor who now regrets his act.

Yet just because this is the impression enforced by Israeli superiority
doesn't make it right. The brutal, violent gap between the promises of
Oslo that the ""occupation was over"" and the reality experienced by the
Palestinians--of ever tighter Israeli control, direct and indirect, over
their lives and their chances to progress and develop--is what ignited
the ""second intifada"". If we now achieve a temporary calm due to fatigue
on both sides without eliminating the cause--the Israeli occupation of
the entire West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip--no
one can predict when that calm will end. But it will. And so will the
calm to follow.

Sometimes the absence of a reply points to the reply. From July 2005 the
Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, carriers of Israeli IDs, will
no longer be permitted to enter Ramallah. That is when construction will
be completed on the wall and the Erez-type passage at Kalandia, deep
inside Palestinian territory. Only those who obtain an entry permit (and
experience teaches us how difficult that is) will be permitted to pass.
I asked the Prime Minister's Office and the IDF whether this doesn't
this contradict two developments: first, permission for residents of
East Jerusalem to vote in the elections for the head of the Palestinian
Authority, and second, the possibility of calm and a return to final
status negotiations. I received no answer.

That silence tells us, just as the bulldozers and the soldiers who
already prevent Jerusalem Palestinians from traveling to Ramallah tell
us, that Israel is following her plan: East Jerusalem will be separated
from Ramallah, and of course from Bethlehem. Only if those bulldozers
cease working immediately, if the soldiers immediately stop preventing
East Jerusalemites from passing through Kalandia, will we know that the
government of Israel seeks calm; that it is prepared to cease the
violence of its arrogance and domination.

According to media reports, Israel rejected the Palestinian demand
(demand? the Palestinians can demand something?) to remove the
roadblocks put up during the past four years. The message is clear: the
party that does not intend to cease building settlements cannot remove
roadblocks. After all, they are intended to ensure the safety of the
settlers and of ongoing settlement expansion. Thus only if all the
roadblocks and checkpoints are removed and the West Bank roads cease to
be strictly for Jews, will we know that Israel wants calm.

Sharon talked at the summit of ""two states"". Just like the Communist
Party of Israel and the Sheli Party more than 30 years ago. But when you
look at what is happening on the ground you realize that this is not a
matter of two states for two peoples but rather of 11 states: the state
of Israel, and alongside and within it the states of Gaza, Hebron,
Bethlehem, Ramallah, Jericho, Tulkarm, Qalqilya, Salfit, Nablus, and
Jenin. Each of these states is separated from the others by growing
Jewish territorial contiguity: a network of expanding settlements,
separate, highly developed and enticing road, electricity and water
infrastructure for Jews only, military emplacements, and permanent and
mobile checkpoints.

Judging by the facts on the ground today, the biggest compromise that
Israel under Sharon will accept is in the number of Palestinian states,
e.g., seven instead of 11.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: There was a lot of talk about a new era and an end of
violence at the Sharm al Sheikh summit. What did you make of the summit?

A: On the one hand we don't want to overload it with
significance and unrealistic expectations. On the other, we mustn't
underestimate or undervalue the significance of having a period in which
there is no violence and in which there is a commitment by the Israeli
occupation and the Palestinians not to resort to violence. A period of
quiet is sine qua non for changing the dynamic on the ground and for
generating a whole new modus operandi, which we hope will be a
substantive peace process.

Q: But in order to ensure a period of quiet, certain things
would need to happen on the ground immediately, wouldn't you agree?

A: Yes, absolutely. Quiet doesn't come out of the blue,
particularly when you have a military occupation. What you need is for
Israel to refrain from conducting any kind of violence or aggression or
escalation, including things like assassinations, the incursions, but
also lifting the siege, and making moves like the release of prisoners
and cessation of building of the wall and settlement activities.

So there is a need to show seriousness of intent and good will on the
one hand, and on the other, if there is a period of calm, that has to be
invested in qualitative and strategic moves ahead, and not exploited in
order to create facts that are more detrimental toward peace.

Q: There was a big disagreement over the proposed release
of 900 prisoners, which would have been the biggest release since the
intifada began. How important is this issue and why?

A: It is important to Palestinians. It cannot be seen as a deal
breaker, but at the same time it is a significant moral, legal,
political and human issue. This touches almost every Palestinian home.
Palestinian prisoners are perceived by all Palestinians not just as
heroic but as political prisoners, and therefore they have the right to
be included in any political agreement. [A significant release] will
improve the climate substantially and show Israeli willingness to
reciprocate in a positive way to the Palestinians.

The problem has always been that Israel has unilaterally decided on the
criteria for prisoner release and cynically manipulated this very human
condition, in terms of releasing prisoners accused of crimes and
misdemeanors, those in Israel without permit, or those who were due to
be released anyway. They have shown they are capable of manipulating the
situation and this has backfired, it has generated tremendous anger and
a sense of betrayal among the Palestinians. So now it is important that
the criteria are agreed to, that the Palestinians indicate very
clearly--this started way back in the pre-Madrid peace talks--that
prisoners released include older prisoners, prisoners since before 1993,
women prisoners, prisoners who are not well, youth and underage
prisoners, without the imposed criteria of ""blood on their hands"", or
any type of separation on the basis of political affiliation.

Q: You mentioned the wall. Surely that is a huge obstacle,
at least in the medium term if not in the short term?

A: It's a strategic issue, actually. The wall, the settlements,
Jerusalem, these are core substantive issues. Israel is creating facts
that will be irreversible and will render any future agreement
unrealistic or unworkable. The wall is a key issue. The wall around
Jerusalem and the settlements around Jerusalem are an embodiment of a
situation that undermines prospects of peace in the future. There you
have a land grab, there you have the isolation of Jerusalem and steps
that prejudge the issue of Jerusalem, and you have a siege that destroys
normal life and economic endeavors. So this is a real test, and this is
something that third parties are called on to address. That's why we are
wondering whether it's the Arab countries that want to be involved, or
the Americans who are expressing a willingness to reengage, or the
Quartet that is supposed to meet on the sidelines of the London meeting.
All of these are supposed to address these core issues. The question is
not just a first modest step of a cessation of violence, but preventing
violations and the distortions of strategic and core issues in the
meantime. This requires an act of will and positive engagement,
particularly on the wall and the settlements around Jerusalem.

Q: This also begs the question of how far Palestinians can
expect the Israelis to go right now. The Israelis will claim there are
political pressures on the government and they can only go so far.

A: That is true, but there are more lethal pressures internally
among the Palestinians. The question is not whether Israel will use a
domestic situation as an excuse to hold back, but rather whether the
Israeli government will lead and take positions that will further the
cause of peace. There is also a certain leverage that can be used by the
US in particular and other friends and allies of Israel if they are
committed to peace.

Q: There is also an internal Palestinian dynamic, and the
factions have apparently committed themselves to a period of calm but
not a ceasefire. How will this play out?

A: I see this commitment as crucial. To be very frank, I think
we have to move beyond factional politics and act as a democracy with
institutions and with the rule of law. We are not here dealing with
armed resistance and factional politics as the only defining forms of
our political reality. There is a clear situation of nation-building, of
institution-building, of rule of law, of an inclusive democracy and
elections that are delivering an accountable and representative
government. We cannot have individual factions or groups decide that
they can give themselves the right to act on behalf of the people, or
the right to act unilaterally, or the right to formulate policies on
their own that can undermine national policies. So the commitment to a
period of calm is crucial, it is important, it shows responsibility and
engagement. But it has to develop into a modus operandi where respect
for pluralistic democracy and the rule of law is displayed by everyone
concerned.

Q: Hamas appears poised to enter Legislative Council
elections. How important would such a step be?

A: It is important. This means there is a gradual
transformation, that Hamas is more and more engaged in the political
realities of the domestic situation in Palestine, that they are willing
to be part of a democracy that would allow for pluralism and peaceful
expression of disagreement and dissent, and certainly would look at the
source of legitimacy as being the constituency and the people rather
than a unilateral definition of power.

So in that sense it is important. It consolidates the nation-building
process, it creates an inclusive political system and helps Palestinian
democracy. And of course it creates a system of checks-and-balances
internally.

Q: Are you optimistic the ceasefire will lead us somewhere
substantial?

A: Not by itself. Not by default. You need to sustain it but
also move ahead. The status quo is untenable. The ceasefire cannot last
forever. There has to be a process with substance, with credibility, and
with the ability to influence reality on the ground, as well as the
political will to move ahead rapidly on substantive issues.
"
"Isr","Neut","After three weeks of combat, the giant statue of Saddam Hussein in
Baghdad's central square was smashed. This symbolic act ended the
despotic regime of the Iraqi dictator. The hour is ripe to offer
congratulations on what has been accomplished, and express hope and
expectations for the future.

There are six good reasons why congratulations for the American victory
in Iraq are in order.

First, I offer congratulations as an Israeli. The elimination of Saddam
Hussein and his repressive regime, together with the destruction of the
arsenal of weapons of mass destruction that Iraq was developing and
producing, have removed the extremely dangerous threat of physical
destruction that Saddam held over Israel.

Secondly, I offer congratulations for a military victory which has
brought a new reality to the Iraqi people. I share the joy of millions
who are tasting liberty for the first time.

Third, congratulations on a quick, crushing and unequivocal military
achievement. We witnessed a decisive victory that was achieved with
minimal losses to the coalition forces fighting in Iraq, and minimal
harm to innocent Iraqi civilians.

Fourth, my thanks for a victory that unmasked the hypocrisy of those
countries in Europe that, motivated by narrow and partisan interests,
sought energetically to prevent action against the dictator from Baghdad.

Fifth, I congratulate the Palestinian people and their leadership, who
had the wisdom to stand aside and avoid openly and declaratively
supporting Saddam Hussein and his extreme and fanatical policies. This
was a shrewd and calculated decision that will benefit the Palestinians.

And finally, I congratulate the president of the United States, George
W. Bush, who knew how to take responsibility and make a tough decision
under unusual political conditions. He rose to the challenge that placed
him at the head of the free world and in command of a struggle against
international terrorism and states, regimes and leaders of the ""axis of
evil"" that abet and support the terrorists.

Beyond the congratulations, I have four hopes and expectations for the
""day after"" the military victory.

I hope that the Iraqi people and state will recover and recuperate and
once again stand on their own two feet, without suffering, pain and
serious injury. I hope the US will know how to establish an intelligent
and sensitive civil administration in Iraq to serve the weighty
needs--material, cultural and other--of a conquered people. And I hope
that the American leadership will take pains to transfer power to an
elected and peace-loving Iraqi government.

In this regard, the American leadership would do well to study the
lessons of the Israeli administration in the Palestinian territories,
learn to make the right decisions, and avoid the many unnecessary
mistakes of the Israeli leadership.

I hope the American success in Iraq does not end there. If we wish to
save this world from chaos; if we seek to live in a world free from
frenzied extremism--the US must stick with the job. As long as there is
no efficient international mechanism that is devoid of partisan or power
interests, Washington must serve as the arbiter and judge.

I hope the strategic and geopolitical reality that was revealed by the
military campaign in Iraq is now understood by those elements in our
region that have been supporting and encouraging religious and
nationalist terrorist organizations. These must now be closed down.

Finally, I hope that Washington holds to its commitment to the parties
involved in our own immediate arena of conflict, and acts quickly and
decisively to renew the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, with the
objective of bringing the two sides to a viable and fair agreement.
Israel and the Palestinians are ripe for it: after two years of violent,
painful and exhausting confrontation, they have come to understand the
pointlessness of trying to realize their political aspirations through
the use of force. Continuing the violent struggle and postponing
compromise will not advance a thing, and will only aggravate the pain
and suffering on both sides.

Both we Israelis and the Palestinians know almost down to the last
detail the contents of the only realistic agreement that is possible. We
are ready to meet the challenge. Yet both sides also have grasped that
they cannot reach the required compromise and cannot attain an agreement
without the active involvement of a third, neutral party whose authority
they recognize and accept.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What is your reaction as an Arab, as a Palestinian and
as an analyst to the events in Iraq?

A: It is a mixed reaction. The first part of it has to do with
the extent of foreign intervention in the region. The other has to do
with the obvious changes that are taking place in the so-called ""world
order."" The third has to do with the ability of a totalitarian regime to
stand for its country. These three things go in different directions,
and it is difficult to give a single comprehensive analysis.

Q: Can you explain more?

A: The war in Iraq raised a serious question about whether we are
now in a neo-imperial era or not. The idea of a superpower just going
ahead with something without United Nations decisions poses the question
for many countries: will they find themselves in the same situation in
the near or farther future?

This eventually will lead to a change in international relations and
diplomacy. The immediate results of this war will be a change towards
conservatism in the attitudes of many small countries. Opening up to the
world seems no longer of great benefit to everybody, as it was in recent
years. I think many countries will reconsider being open to UN
organizations and the world community, whether in the areas of weaponry
or economics or otherwise.

Concerning what you might call ""the world order,"" there is now a growing
factor (it is not a new factor--it existed in the sixties and during the
Vietnam War) of massive worldwide public interest in world politics. I
think that this revitalization and its role in world politics has to be
taken into consideration. So far we haven't seen its effects on the
decision-making process, perhaps with the exception of Germany, but I
think that it will begin to be taken into consideration.

Q: In the Arab world as well?

A: This will also affect the Arab world, if you bear in mind the
third component of the analysis, which includes a situation where the
Iraqi regime could not depend on the Iraqi people to defend it. This
raises a question of how much a government can enter into conflict with
its own nation. Usually a government can count on national feelings, but
if a country like Iraq with a very strong nationalistic tradition could
not, then this poses a question for many Arab regimes: how can they
defend against external intervention by other nations?

Put together with the populist factor in world politics, slowly but
surely we will be viewing some changes in the Arab world.

Q: So you think that the civic relationship will improve?

A: It might eventually improve, but it will take a little bit of
give-and-take and some confrontation. Now everyone will have to measure
once again how far they can go, and during this ""testing time,"" things
might happen.

Q: What about the war's effect on the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict?

A: I can't think of any major effects that can be thought of as
direct results of the war in Iraq on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict
and the situation in Palestine. The widespread analysis that tries to
equivocate between the situation now and the first Gulf War is baseless,
I would say. The situation is completely different now, especially
because the situation in Palestine and in the Palestinian community is a
different one.

But the process of strangulation by the Israelis of the Palestinians has
been coming to an end. There was a question of whether Israel could
extend this further in the context of the war in Iraq, but the answer is
clear and it was ""no"". Now, minor changes will likely happen in the
situation here, but they should not be seen as a result of the Iraqi war.

There was previously an urgent need to do something about the conflict
and this ""something"" was postponed because of the Iraqi war. Now that it
is over, or when it is over, this postponement has to stop.

Q: How would you put into context Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon's comments about settlements to Ha'aretz newspaper?

A: I thought the main comments were made by the journalist, not
by Sharon. I didn't see that Sharon said anything new. The idea of
painful concessions has been repeated, the idea of agreeing with the
American administration has been there, the idea of agreeing with the
Bush speech was already there, the idea of the establishment of a
Palestinian state was also already there.

The major thing that I found interesting in this interview was the
question put as to whether the moment of truth has arrived. Sharon's
response was not negative.

The major difference now will be how the international community--and
the Quartet in particular--approaches the implementation of the roadmap
                                                . Will there be leeway
to keep the map without a map, so to speak, or will there be some sort
of enforcement for its implementation? I don't think that this depends
on Sharon's will, but on the kind of pressure that is put on Israel.

Q: Do you think that the current back-and-forth between
Syria and the United States will have an effect on the
Palestinian-Israeli track?

A: It is too early to judge. I am not sure what is behind the
tension. It might be a tactic used by the Americans to make sure that
Syria does not support or aid some sort of resistance from Syria in Iraq
that will make the life of American rule harder. There exists another
analysis that asks ""who is next after Iraq?"" but I don't think that it
is the right time to make such judgments. We have still not seen an
overall picture of the American attitude towards the world in general
after Iraq. It is possible there will be euphoria over winning the war,
or there could be drawbacks when it is shown that, even in Iraq, it is
not easy to control things.
"
"Isr","Neut","In the winter of 2001, shortly before Ariel Sharon defeated Ehud Barak
in elections for prime minister, I had the opportunity in person to hear
his vision of a Palestinian state. He removed a large map of the Land of
Israel from a corner cabinet in his modest Likud headquarters office in
Tel Aviv and pointed to the areas he proposed annexing to Israel. Moving
from north to south, the pointer in his hand went from the Ariel bloc
deep in Samaria to greater Jerusalem, and from there to the Etzion bloc
and Hebron. Then the pointer hovered over the Jordan Valley, from Bet
Shean to the Dead Sea. These regions, Sharon explained, are vital for
Israel's security. They must not be conceded even in return for the best
of peace agreements.

I asked Sharon if he knew any Palestinian who would suffice with a state
made up of three enclaves bereft of territorial contiguity. He replied
that that problem had preoccupied Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) when he
examined the very same map during one of his visits to Sycamore Ranch.
""I told him,"" Sharon related, ""that there are places where we drive
underneath Palestinian territory, such as the tunnel road to the Etzion
bloc. We can implement the same arrangement-tunnels or bridges-in other
places as well.""

In the course of time, following the presentation of his vision of a
Palestinian state by United States President George W. Bush, Prime
Minister Sharon termed this idea (which in private conversations he used
to compare to the ""bantustan"" model of apartheid in South Africa)
""transportation contiguity."" Such semantic exercises serve Sharon in
bridging between the aspiration that Israel hold onto at least half the
West Bank, the international consensus that the Palestinians deserve an
independent state, and Israel's demographic interest. After the Oslo
accord, Sharon gradually recognized that terms like ""self government""
and ""autonomy"" had become outmoded as models for a long-term solution.
He realized that the interim agreement had in fact turned areas A into
autonomous regions, and that under final status it would be necessary to
go one step further.

Sharon's decision to pronounce the words ""Palestinian state"" was greeted
in Israel and the world with great excitement; it even helped pave the
way for the Labor party to join Sharon's first government. So joyful was
the response that the public failed to notice that, beyond the headline,
it was hard to find in the details of Sharon's plan any resemblance to
the standard definition of a ""state"". Few, for example, bothered to
search the globe for a sovereign state all of whose land links to the
outside world were controlled by another state. (Sharon insists that
even under final status Israel will control the ""Palestinian state's""
land, air, and naval border transit points.) The proof that nothing has
changed is provided by the course of the separation fence and the
never-ending expansion of the settlements in the three areas that Sharon
seeks to annex to Israel. And even this meager ""state"" would be
permitted by Sharon to emerge only after 15, 20 or even 50 years of
interim arrangements.

It is hard to find any bridge that could conceivably link Sharon's
vision of a Palestinian state to that of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat. The latter's room for flexibility does not exceed two or three
percent of West Bank territory, and even that would be part of a
one-on-one swap in terms of the size and quality of land involved. The
Palestinian approach has not changed since the Algiers declaration of
1988 that adopted UN Security Council resolutions 242
                                            and 338
                                           . Then the Palestinian
National Council gave Arafat a mandate to make concessions only against
the PLO's original demands for ""greater Palestine"" and for total
compliance with the right of return of the 1948 refugees. Throughout all
the final status discussions, from the talks that preceded the Camp
David summit in July 2000 through the Geneva accord
                                               of late 2003, not a
single Palestinian negotiator was prepared even to look at a map that
did not give the Palestinian state territorial contiguity and full
access to its capital in East Jerusalem.

The letter of April 14, 2004
                                                   that President Bush
delivered to Sharon in order to help him gain Likud approval for the
disengagement plan indicates that Bush's vision of a Palestinian state
is closer to that of Arafat. Bush rejected Sharon's request to cancel
the administration's opposition to the expansion of settlements in the
three settlement blocs. He sufficed with recognition of the demographic
reality created in the territories since 1967. That reality can be
translated into a final status agreement for the establishment of a
Palestinian state in 94-96 percent of the territories, with fair land
swaps. That was the vision of President Bill Clinton--which was thwarted
by violence and shortsightedness.
"
"Pal","Neut","The fact that there is an international consensus--conceptually at
least--that the establishment of a ""Palestinian state"" is a prerequisite
for peace between the Arab world and Israel is in itself testimony to
the success of the Palestinian struggle. Israel's failure to crush the
Palestinian resistance by sheer and brutal force has compelled both
Labor and even right-wing Likud to accept the futility of continuing to
deny the Palestinian political identity.

However, Israeli and American recognition of the necessity of creating
""a Palestinian state"" by no means indicates genuine acceptance of the
Palestinian people's right to exercise self-determination and/or
sovereignty. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's endorsement--even
verbally--of the words ""Palestinian state"" and ""withdrawal"" is an
important shift that cannot be underestimated; yet it is important to
scrutinize closely the practical meaning of these terms as uttered by
the Israeli government. The same applies to the United States: George W.
Bush has become the first president to commit to the establishment of a
Palestinian state following decades of American reluctance, and at times
vehement resistance, to the idea of Palestinian self-determination, let
alone statehood.

I remember asking a senior US State Department official back in 1992 to
explain the US opposition to both Palestinian statehood and
self-determination. The official, who for the next decade was involved
in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, explained it as follows: Such
recognition could threaten Israel's legitimacy. In other words, it would
be paramount to acknowledging Palestinians' historic rights in Palestine
and potentially raising questions about the legitimacy of the state of
Israel and how it was established.

The official went on to say that the US position could change if Israel
shifted its position. For Israel, Palestinian nationhood was long seen
as the antithesis to the Israeli identity. It implied opening the file
of the Palestinian dispossession in 1948 and the right of return of
Palestinians expelled or driven out by fear of massacres and the
fighting in 1947 and 1948. But the Palestinian intifadas of 1987 and
2000 changed the dynamic of the Israeli-Palestinian equation.

Controlling the Palestinians--even after bringing the Palestinian
Liberation Organization from Tunis with the declared goal of enforcing
Palestinian compliance with Oslo--has utterly failed as a strategy.
Initially Israel--after giving up its attempts of the 1970s and '80s to
get Jordan to represent the Palestinians--decided to deal with the
existing Palestinian nationhood by undercutting prerequisites to
sovereignty and excluding diaspora Palestinians.

As we saw throughout the Oslo process, Israel maintains the upper hand
in defining the scope, timing, and nature of its redeployments of troops
and determining the jurisdiction of a future Palestinian entity. The
continued Jewish settlement expansions, home demolitions, land
expropriations, and more dangerously, the erecting of the apartheid
wall, are all designed to ensure a fragmented Palestinian entity and
identity. This fragmentation undermines the possibility of sovereign
nationhood.

The US, in spite of shy reprimands, fully supported Israel's steps to
create facts on the ground that practically predetermined the size and
jurisdiction of a Palestinian entity. By the time Israeli and American
leaders started talking about ""a Palestinian state,"" it was stripped of
its meaning as an exercise in Palestinian self-determination and
independence. It was reduced instead to forced Palestinian submission to
the diktats of military and political power. In his infamous landmark
""Bush Declaration                                                   ,""
the American president went further by flagrantly depriving the
Palestinians of the right to exercise their self-determination by
reducing the so-called ""peace process"" to an internal Israeli-American
deal in the old fashion of deciding the fate of colonized people in
closed rooms.

For the Palestinians, meanwhile, statehood has remained a dream of
liberty, freedom, and independence for which they have been struggling.
Now they are watching this dream vanish rapidly under the weight of
Israeli bulldozers, helicopter gunships, and full American endorsement
for Sharon's so-called Gaza withdrawal plan, which transforms Gaza into
a besieged strip, isolated from the West Bank.

Meanwhile, by annexing big blocs of settlements, cutting through
villages, and further fragmenting the Palestinian population with the
apartheid wall, Israel--backed by the US--has reduced the Palestinian
state to a cover for colonized, besieged ""islands"". The Palestinian
leadership, which was totally excluded from the negotiations, is left
with the task of controlling and preventing resistance after the Israeli
withdrawal from Gaza Strip, while at the same time deluding itself that
this withdrawal could be a prelude to genuine statehood.
"
"Isr","Neut","When the Israel Defense Forces won the 1967 War, there were two
important consequences for Palestinian history. One was the conquest of
the Palestinians' lands in the West Bank and Gaza Strip--without which
it is doubtful whether those lands would ever be returned to them--and
the beginning of a process of establishing a Palestinian state. The
other was the destruction of patterns of government, in the sense of the
system of reciprocal relations between the regime and the population.
This system of relations has existed since time immemorial in the Arab
countries; it explains the coexistence of despised regimes with the
populations that despise them.

This article seeks to discuss primarily the second consequence: the
reforms that Israel decided to institute in the ruling systems in the
territories it occupied. The conquest of the territories itself opened
the way to the establishment of a Palestinian state. The changes in the
patterns of governing the population of the territories and the
establishment of settlements, while not diverting this trend, have
turned the process into a cycle of blood and fire.

What are the essence and the significance of ruling practices in the
political culture of Arab society? They are a function of the absence of
a democratic tradition in which the people are sovereign and choose
their representatives for defined periods of time, and there is a
mechanism for replacing the government. Since such mechanisms do not
exist in Arab society, the modus vivendi between the ruler and the
population rests on several elements:


1. The regime is supported by the army, whose main task is loyalty to
and defense of that regime;

2. maximum dependency of the citizenry on the regime--usually by means
of a system of mukhtars and local authorities who represent the regime
in the eyes of the population, and vice versa;

3. a disparity between the dogmatic and the pragmatic, i.e., between
principles and actual behavior;

4. limitations on freedom of expression; in a society lacking in
democratic tradition, words easily turn into violence;

5. in view of the unique situation in the two territories of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel found in place in 1967 additional
restrictions that were embodied in a system of laws and directives that
had been imposed upon the residents.

Before Moshe Dayan, minister of defense in 1967, had time to learn what
was already in place in the territories--what in fact ensured the
equilibrium between rulers and the citizenry there--he decided to
dismantle the system of laws and directives that had existed prior to
1967. This involved elimination of the curfew in Gaza; erasing the Green
Line between Israel and the territories; canceling the ban on newspapers
(shortly after the occupation some 30 newspapers began to appear,
representing the various factions of the Palestine Liberation
Organization); removing government units from populated areas to prevent
friction; appointing to positions in the military government army
officers who neither knew Arab society nor spoke the language, in order
to ensure the success of the famous ""non-interference policy""; and
additional instances of mistaken policymaking.

The attitude toward the future of the territories was also confused: it
sought, on the one hand, to maintain the West Bankers' link to the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, while on the other, in the course of
superfluous elections that Dayan forced upon the West Bank in 1972 and
1976, to bring about the removal of mayors who supported Jordan; it
sought to encourage integration of the population with Israel while at
the same time opening the bridges on the Jordan River, thereby better
enabling the PLO to take control over the population and recruit it for
acts of violence against Israel; and it projected yet another idea, a
""functional arrangement"" in which residents of the West Bank would vote
for the parliament in Amman while their lands were ruled by Israel. Add
to this Israel's reaction to the idea of federation between the two
banks of the Jordan, which King Hussein proposed in his speech of March
15, 1972. This was perhaps the best idea proposed until then, and Israel
rejected it.

In retrospect, what were Israel's alternatives after it occupied the
territories?

First, it could have followed in the footsteps of the regimes that
preceded 1967 and ruled the population in accordance with modes that
existed prior to the occupation, thereby generating coexistence between
the population and our rule along the lines of relationships that exist
between regime and citizenry in Arab countries. Secondly, it could have
accepted an arrangement with Jordan that would have left none of the
territories in our hands but would have provided peace along the 1967
borders. And third, it could have anticipated the potential of the PLO,
whose strength grew through a process of liberating itself from the
guardianship of the Arab countries, and tried to reach an agreement with
it.

What is the alternative today?

Throughout the history of modern Israel we have found ourselves in
control of Arab territories five times. By the by, for 18 years we
maintained a military government over the Israeli Arabs of the Galilee,
the Triangle and the Negev. This was the longest and most successful
rule of them all, not because we were once wiser, but rather because we
allowed their philosophy of survival to work. This happened during three
other periods as well: in Gaza after the 1956 Sinai Operation; at Faid
(Egypt) after the 1973 War; and in Lebanon, in the beginning, in 1982.
In 1967 we did not know how to benefit from the Arabs' philosophy of
survival. Meanwhile our world here has changed so much.

Today we cannot reverse this process. We must pursue the goal of a state
for the Palestinians--and separate them and us. In return it is in our
interest to relinquish the settlements and to be generous with regard to
the 22.5 percent of historic Palestine that remains for them.
"
"Pal","Neut","The near-total Israeli reoccupation of the West Bank and parts of the
Gaza Strip has interrupted all aspects of Palestinian life, and resulted
in tremendous material and psychological damage to Palestinian society.
No one wants to believe that we are back to square one after our
ten-year investment in the peace process. Most Palestinians are very
pessimistic and feel that the peace process is actually over, at the
time when it could have resulted in a total withdrawal of Israeli forces
from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Instead, we are faced with Israeli control, incessant military damage
and a curfew unprecedented even in the early days of the Israeli
occupation. The implications seem to be that the Palestinian Authority
no longer exists and cannot provide any of the services that it should
provide, according to the Oslo accords.

We have arrived at this destination because the peace camps on both the
Israeli and Palestinian sides committed semi-suicide. Former Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak showed positive signs toward compromise at
Camp David, as did Palestinians. But just as we were close to a complete
package that would have ended the occupation and established a
Palestinian state, Barak permitted Ariel Sharon's provocative visit to
Al Aqsa mosque, and launched his ""revenge"" on Palestinians, giving a
free hand to his military forces to kill Palestinian demonstrators
everywhere and provoking more protests and reactions on the Palestinian
side.

When Palestinians resorted to military means, especially against Israeli
civilians, they sent the wrong message to the Israeli public, aiding the
Israeli Likud propaganda stating that Palestinians do not want peace.
Together, Barak and Palestinian military reactions actually assisted the
Likud and Ariel Sharon in coming to power. With the election of Sharon,
we were then faced with an individual who has always viewed the peace
process as his own personal nightmare. On his initiative, the
confrontations have only grown more fiery and grave.

But Sharon's military solution will not bring the Israeli public the
security it seeks. Nor do Palestinians have any other way of achieving
their rights than through peace negotiations. As long as he is given
pretext, Sharon will not allow any serious negotiations with
Palestinians. He will continue to create obstacles to restarting talks,
obstacles that will endure even after he is gone from the scene.

I believe that we are looking at the prolonging of this terrible
situation of confrontation, an atmosphere that will aid the Likud in
diverting public opinion from seeing its settlements, land
confiscations, demolition of the Palestinian economy and deprivation of
Palestinians of managing everything--down to the minutes of their every
day. Now that we may witness a war against Iraq, Sharon will be free
beneath this smokescreen to commit all the crimes he has dreamed of. His
fantasies, I fear, are much more vast than the crimes he has already
carried out.

We should observe that fundamentalists on the Palestinian side are a
counterpart to the fundamentalists on the Israeli side. All Likud
actions are actually encouraging and feeding the politics of Palestinian
and Arab fundamentalist movements, and visa versa. We must break this
vicious cycle, where the silent majority is stuck in the middle. There
must be a joint struggle between the peace camp on the Israeli side
towards ending the Sharon era on the one hand, and the Palestinian peace
camp towards securing power in the next elections, on the other. The end
of the Sharon government, the end of the confusion in Palestinian
politics and the realization of discipline in the Palestinian struggle
are key steps toward the resumption of the peace process.

These are not easy tasks for either the Israeli peace camp, or its
Palestinian counterpart. Since Sharon has determinant control over
events, he can continue feeding the vicious cycle of violence and
bloodshed. That situation could lead the Palestine Liberation
Organization to dissolve the Palestinian National Authority in order to
break the cycle.

In this situation where the Palestinian National Authority has been for
so long in a position where it cannot protect its citizens, and the
Israeli government deigns to respect any agreements signed with the PLO,
it would be better to ask the international community to shoulder its
responsibility of protecting the Palestinian people. Sharon's military
power politics game is to paralyze the Palestinian National Authority,
and hold it responsible for the actions of every Palestinian.
Regrettably, the United States administration buys Sharon's charges
(even as it knows the Authority is paralyzed) and is asking the
Authority to stop Palestinians' military reactions and ""invest 100
percent effort.""

One way of beating this game would have been to dissolve the Palestinian
Authority, and ask for international intervention to fill the vacuum. If
the PLO chooses to go down this avenue, however, it must coordinate its
actions with the United Nations, Europe, the Arab countries, Russia and
the United States. These concerned parties should be asked to create an
interim United Nations government to fill the vacuum and provide
protection to the Palestinian people. This government should prepare for
the establishment of a Palestinian state according to the American
vision based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. It is obvious
that Israel will resist any international intervention, and will try to
revive the Israeli ""civil administration"" to fill the vacuum. This
situation will put Israel once again in the position where it cannot use
F-16s, Apache helicopters and tanks on a civilian population--a position
that was once condemned and rejected by the entire world and the
majority of Israelis.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: Is there room for a viable Palestinian state alongside a
viable Jewish state in the Land of Israel?

A: The word ""viable"" has been introduced into the political
parlance of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in recent years even
though it has largely remained an undefined term. The Israeli government
has stated that it is prepared to live alongside a Palestinian state.
But at the same time it will have its own territorial and functional
interests that must be protected in order to provide for Israel's
security. Ideally, the borders and the powers of a Palestinian state
should be a product of negotiation. But at present Israel does not have
a negotiating partner to help define these elements.

Q: So if Israel withdraws unilaterally, can the remaining
territory be defined as a Palestinian state?

A: Israel will approach the final boundaries that it regards as
acceptable from the standpoint of its interest in retaining defensible
borders, which has been a long-term interest of every Israeli prime
minister since 1967. In his last address to the Knesset, one month
before his assassination, the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin outlined
his concept of defensible borders for Israel. There were elements that
had nothing to do with security but with Israel's national history,
e.g., his insistence that Jerusalem remain united under Israeli
sovereignty. But he also spoke of the need to retain settlement blocs
and the Jordan Rift Valley ""in the widest sense of the term."" This was
Rabin's legacy to the people of Israel.

Q: Do the disengagement plans of the current Israeli
government allow for a viable Palestinian state?

A: In the future, Israel should approach its options on the
territorial aspects of a settlement in the West Bank and Gaza with two
factors in mind. One, what are the lessons of the Oslo failure and how
can Israel avoid repeating them? And two, what is the likely security
environment that Israel will face in the Middle East in the foreseeable
future?

Q: You appear to insist on defining the viability of a
Palestinian state in terms of Israel's needs. What about Palestinian needs?

A: The term ""viable"" is like the term ""the legitimate rights of the
Palestinians."" As [United States President] Jimmy Carter once asked
[Israeli Prime Minister] Menachem Begin, ""are there illegitimate
rights?"" Accordingly, would Israel support a nonviable Palestinian
state? ""Viable"" is a term that is difficult to debate. Clearly different
parties attach different meanings to the term. Does it mean territorial
contiguity? Imply a certain number of square kilometers? If so, is
Singapore viable?

Israel will recognize a Palestinian state as long as Israel's interests
are protected. In the 1980s many concluded from this discussion that
federal and con-federal structures would be preferable. But that's
voluntary, and there's no indication that Jordan has such an interest.

Q: You are a former Israeli ambassador to the United
Nations. Does the United Nations define membership criteria in terms of
viability?

A: There are in international law criteria that serve as
guidelines for states to decide upon recognizing newly emerging
countries. For example, that there is a defined territory, a permanent
population, the capacity to enter into relations with other states. But
territorial critical mass or contiguity are not criteria.
"
"Pal","Neut","There is no simple solution for the Palestinian refugee problem--only a
creative one. One must first begin by questioning the nature of both the
Palestinian and the Israeli nation-states, the concept of state
sovereignty and its inherent violence, and the inclusion/exclusion that
the state exercises to determine who is a citizen.

In the spirit of Hannah Arendt, the state is seen as more of a problem
than a solution. Take, for example, a Bethlehem Fatah communique of
December 2003: ""If we must choose between the Palestinian state and the
right of return, we will choose the latter."" But is there a solution
that encompasses the right of return and a Palestinian state? Only the
framework of an extraterritorial nation state does, especially if one
third of the population of that state is refugees. We must rethink all
traditional political-legal categories, particularly in the Middle East.
In that process, the refugee figure becomes the frontier of humanity,
revealing the current crisis in the ""trinity"" of nation-state-territory.

The crisis of the modern nation state is that the exception is
everywhere becoming the rule. We increasingly live in a time where
populations? ontological status as legal subjects is suspended. The
failure of laws that govern citizenship marks a decisive turning point
in the life of the modern nation-state and a definitive emancipation
from the naive notions of ""people"" and ""citizen.""

In this context, the status of the ""refugee"" vis-a-vis the ""citizen"" is
more than problematic. Can we imagine a solution to the problem of
stateless and refugee Palestinians that does not rely on the
disciplinary apparatuses of the police and security forces? This issue
is not relegated to the Middle East; more and more refugees are excepted
from legal norms in many European countries. There, refugees maintain
the vulnerability of their status even after acquiring nationality. Any
criminal or other questionable activities puts them at risk for
denaturalization.

A solution that proposes head-counting the refugees in a given place and
offering them a few months to decide their fate is an utopist solution.
Individuals prefer to maintain flexible citizenship and multiple
passports, even if they choose to settle in one place.

According to a 2003 Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research
survey, some 60 percent of Palestinians willing to return to Israel want
to hold nationality to the Palestinian state. Only two percent want
Israeli nationality and one fourth of the entire sample prefer to hold
both nationalities. If the accumulation of foreign passports for some
globalized businesspeople is ""a matter of convenience and confidence"" in
uncertain political times, for almost all of the Palestinians who reside
abroad, it is a matter of survival. For those who have never possessed a
passport in their lifetime, having been forced to make do with a travel
document, the passport signifies and allows basic connectivity to family
and labor markets.

As such, while the classic model of return migration studies mainly
envisions a definitive return, the concept of return can be amplified to
include a form of being ""in between."" Transnational studies provide an
excellent conceptual framework for analyzing the experiences of
migrants, those who choose to live between worlds. This emerging new
form of refugeeness and migrant status is marked by active participation
in the cultural, social, economic and political lives of both the
country of origin and the host country, and provides new boundaries for
solving the Palestinian problem. This cannot be realized if the future
Palestinian state is conceived as a classic nation-state. Instead, why
not propose extra-territorialized Palestinian and Israeli nation states?

Currently, the political environments that frame Palestinian
transmigration are hostile to many transnational practices--or at least
do not facilitate them. Broadly, there appear to be two asynchronous
dynamics at work: one that accelerates the presence of transnational
actors in the territories, and another that is bound up with the
identity and political cohesion of the decision makers of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA). For example, since the 1999
promulgation of a PNA law regulating non-governmental organizations, the
Palestinian Ministry of Interior has refused to allow Palestinian
Israelis to serve on the administrative board of any Palestinian
organization. This demarcation policy was also shared by some in the
private sector who wanted to reinforce the separation between the
interim Palestinian territories and Israel. The Palestinian
Telecommunications Company, PALTEL, tried for some time to price calls
between the Palestinian territories including East Jerusalem, and West
Jerusalem and the rest of Israel, as international calls--not taking
into account how this might impede connectivity within family networks
for one. The tension between these interests is quite normal. Refugees
develop a flexible notion of citizenship in order to accumulate capital
and power. Meanwhile however, the state seeks to preserve its inflexible
sovereignty.

While Palestinian scholars are accustomed to dealing with identity in
its strict legal sense, it is important to recognize that capitalism,
colonialism and culture also constrain and shape the subject, the
individual and the collective. The crystallization of Palestinian
identity is a relatively recent phenomenon. The same can be said for the
Arab and Israeli identities that emerged during the same period. Because
of the tenuousness of this process, the state in the Arab world became a
nationalizing state: after ""making"" Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, those
states must subsequently make Syrians, Lebanese and Jordanians. The same
could be said of Israel and Israelis.

Thus we are far from a civic type of nationalism which relies on
voluntary commitment, a flexible criteria of membership in the national
collectivity, and a consensual legal process for resolving tensions.
Generally speaking, migrants are not encouraged (and sometimes hindered)
from declaring allegiance to both their countries of origin and their
host countries. This fact explains the manner in which some Palestinians
are assimilated to their host societies, while others retain a sense of
unstated double identity with less feeling of alienation.

The weakness of the center of gravity of the Palestinian diaspora,
alongside the relatively new Palestinian national identity, raises many
complex questions about Palestinian state formation and the ability of
the PNA to challenge the classic pattern of citizenship and
nation-states. One can imagine two forms that might allow a nation-state
to deal with people outside of its borders: a de-territorialized
nation-state or an extra-territorialized nation-state. Studies on
transnationalism may be a good framework for thinking about the former.
Some consider countries of origin as ""de-territorialized nation-states""
in the sense that the state now stretches beyond its geographic
boundaries. By this logic, there is no longer a diaspora because
wherever its people go, their state goes with them. In this region,
however, it is very hard to imagine this kind of state being born.
Anthony Smith's argument that nation-states are ""territorial by
definition"" bears some weight.

The tension that currently exists between the practices of Palestinian
transmigrants/returnees/refugees and the policies of the PNA shows that
the prospect of an extra-territorialized nation-state is more feasible
than the former. In this case the state is territorialized, but it
distinguishes between citizenship and nationality. Accordingly, the
rights and the duties of those who live in Palestine would not be a
function of their nationality (i.e. whether they are Palestinian or
not.) At the same time, those who live abroad who are of Palestinian
origin could also enjoy rights and duties, even though not residing
permanently in Palestine. Such an arrangement would be possible only if
the PNA was able to enter into special agreements with countries that
host Palestinian refugees, in order to facilitate full dual citizenship.
This, particularly in light of outstanding questions regarding the
capacity for absorbing Palestinian refugees, could be an honorable
solution for those not willing to return but who would nevertheless like
to belong to a Palestinian nation and be involved in Palestinian public
affairs. It can be expected that many Palestinian refugees will return
only to obtain Palestinian nationality and then leave, or simultaneously
maintain two places of residency.

The model of two extraterritorial nation states--Israeli and
Palestinian--is a model that falls somewhere between the two-state
solution which due to power inequities is now leading to an apartheid
system, and the absolutely unpopular solution of a bi-national state. A
sort of ""confederation"" may be a more feasible solution: two
extraterritorial nation states, with Jerusalem as their capital,
contemporaneously forming, without territorial divisions, two different
states.
"
"Isr","Neut","It is easy to miss the larger regional and domestic context of United
States Secretary of State Powell's mission to achieve an
Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire. Obviously, the US is worried about the
escalation in Palestinian terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and
Israel's relatively large-scale military responses. Obviously, the US
would have liked to push the sides toward serious conflict resolution.
But these aren't the main reasons for the recent dramatic reversal in
the policy of President George W. Bush toward the level and intensity of
American mediation.

During the 2000 presidential elections and from the beginning of his
tenure at the White House, Bush said he would avoid what he defined as a
fatal mistake on the part of President Clinton of getting so personally
and intensely involved in Arab-Israeli conflict resolution. Bush argued
that Clinton's repeated failures reflected badly both on America's
standing in the Middle East and the world and on the office of the
presidency. Unlike Clinton, who defined Arab-Israeli peace as the most
important goal of his administration and saw himself as a genuine
peacemaker, Bush has adopted other values and other goals. Consequently,
until very recently he sent to the area relatively low level officials
such as General Anthony Zinni and Assistant Secretary of State William
Burns.

Bush reluctantly reversed his position primarily due to the requirements
of his plan to eliminate the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It is
quite possible that if this plan had not existed, Bush would not have
reversed his policy on US involvement in the present crisis, and Powell
would not have traveled to the region. The number one priority in US
foreign policy today is the global war on terrorism, and the current
number one priority in this war is the plan to complete the 1991 Gulf
War by eliminating Saddam Hussein's threats to the region and the world.
Following the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, the Bush
administration is convinced that if Saddam acquires weapons of mass
destruction he would not hesitate to employ them against the US and its
allies in the Middle East. Hence the need for preventive action against
Iraq.

The Bush administration is attempting to mobilize support among its Arab
allies for a military attack on Saddam, or at a minimum to obtain a
commitment from them to voice only token criticism of a possible
American attack. This was the main purpose of Vice President Dick
Cheney's recent visit to the Middle East. Arab leaders told him that
they could not deal with the Saddam issue until the Palestinian-Israeli
violence was resolved. Thus, it could be said that from an American
perspective this violence is hindering the campaign against Saddam. Seen
in this context, the reversal in Bush's stance, the upgrading of US
involvement, and the sending of Powell to the region are justified
because they are all intended to remove a serious obstacle on the road
to Baghdad.

Possible US determination to achieve a ceasefire is directly related to
the larger context and the highest priorities of American policy in the
Middle East. This rationale notwithstanding, even if the
Palestinian-Israeli confrontation is miraculously resolved in the very
near future, Arab leaders, even those aligned with the US, are unlikely
to support a military action against Saddam. But until then they are
likely to use the Palestinian-Israeli confrontation as an excuse to
refrain from taking a clear stand on Saddam.

Powell's mission is extremely difficult because the key to any ceasefire
is an effective campaign by Arafat against terrorism launched from his
territories, while the US has more leverage over Israel. Every
Palestinian act of terror is further eroding support for the
Palestinians both among official Washington and public opinion. Contrary
to public statements, the Bush people consider Arafat a terrorist who
has never lived up to his commitments and who is systematically cheating
and lying to them. Bush feels that while he and his aids have strongly
advocated in public the establishment of a Palestinian state, Arafat has
been encouraging and glorifying terrorism with the help of Iraq and Iran.

Bush cannot ignore American public opinion, which overwhelmingly favors
Israel. Despite negative media coverage of Israeli military activities,
in the latest Gallup poll an overwhelming 70% to 24% of Americans say
that Palestinian violence is terrorism, while a majority of 53% to 39%
say Israeli violence is a legitimate act of war. While Americans favor
Israel over the Palestinians by a 50% to 15% margin, Republicans,
members of Bush's party, identify more with Israel over the Palestinians
by a 67% to 8% margin.

All these external and internal conditions leave only narrow margins for
Powell's diplomacy in the Middle East.
"
"Pal","Neut","All eyes have been focused on United States Secretary of State Colin
Powell's meetings with Palestinian and Israeli leaders in an effort to
defuse a crisis that has the potential to menace regional stability.
After delaying for eight days, with a threat in between to boycott
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, Colin Powell declared that the
meeting with Arafat had been ""useful and constructive."" The use of that
standard diplomatic euphemism for lack of real progress should not be
surprising, given the enormous built-in impediments to a viable
settlement of the conflict. Most basic of these is that the peacemaker
is also Israel's co-belligerent, chief diplomatic backer, bank roller,
and arms supplier.

It behooves all of us who wait anxiously for some sort of a
breakthrough, to keep three factors in mind as we ponder the
possibilities for a way out of a potentially-enlarged zero-sum
situation. First, there is the historic legacy of US peacemaking in the
area, second, the world-view of the self-designated sole conciliator,
honest broker, and catalyst for peace and third, the Israeli strategy,
its real objectives and perceptions of the end game.

The contacts and negotiations that will take place in the short-term
will undoubtedly focus on the micro issues. But breaking the logjam is
going to take much more than process, including denunciations,
proclamations and cosmetic measures. The political horizon must be
inextricably linked to the micro issues, with the later merely the
necessary steps towards the political road map that already exists and
is already anchored in a global consensus. The substance of that
consensus has existed for thirty-five years--land for peace, end of the
occupation, rollback of the colonial settlements, a Palestinian state
alongside (not within) Israel and a just solution for the refugee
problem in accordance with international law.

It is perhaps more important to ""flesh out"" the three factors that will
help us understand why that consensus has been thwarted than to ""flesh
out"" Arafat's latest denunciatory statement, as the US has stated it
will do.

First, there is a legacy of rejectionism on the part of the peacemaker
and/or Israel, going back to 1969. Israel has managed to reject a number
of United States proposals. The first casualty was the Rogers Plan
(1969), followed by Israel's frustration of Governor Scranton's mission
on behalf of Nixon (1970), the rejection of Egyptian President Sadat's
land for peace-mutual recognition proposal (1971), the rejection of
President Carter's call for a Geneva International conference in 1977,
the Reagan plan of 1982, the Shultz Plan of 1988, the Baker plan of
1989, and the successful thwarting of Bush Sr.'s attempt to link loan
guarantees to the issue of Jewish settlements in and around Jerusalem
(1990). Obviously, the younger Bush remains keenly aware of his father's
ordeal as he now ponders the outcome of his own unheeded request for
Sharon to withdraw ""immediately"" more than eleven days ago.

The Palestine Liberation Organization and the Arab states, on the other
hand, have associated themselves with the basic elements of the global
consensus expressed in countless documents, including the 1971 Sadat
offer, the Security Council resolution of 1976 calling for
implementation of Resolution 242 and a two-state solution, the 1980
Venice Declaration by the European countries recognizing Palestinian
self-determination, the 1981 Fahd Plan, the 1988 PLO recognition of
Israel, the 1998 European Union declaration, all the way up to the plan
of Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah adopted by the Arab League last month and
offering full recognition of Israel in exchange for ending the Israeli
occupation.

The second major barrier to a quick breakthrough is related to President
Bush's world view, a rather Hobbesian conception, which depicts a grim
landscape in need of a firm hand to ""smoke out"" terrorists and terminate
the scourge through the use of raw power. This muscular approach
contrasts with the traditional means of relying on policing mechanisms,
the judicial apparatus and monetary controls, among other diplomatic
means, for routing terrorism.

Thus a major obstacle to a successful American mission is the spurious
view that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's war against a civilian
population is not a breech of the 1949 Geneva Convention--a war crime in
the Nuremberg sense of the term--but a war to dismantle the terrorist
infrastructure. This myopic logic has resonated with the
intellectually-impoverished mind of George W. Bush, who has hastened to
applaud Sharon's efforts perceived to reinforce Bush's own crusade.

The pragmatists among Bush's advisors, together with retired seasoned
politicians such as Lee Hamilton and Zbigniew Brzezinski, as well as the
editorial writers of the New York Times and the Washington Post, have
warned the president of the negative long-term strategic implications of
US complicity in Sharon's onslaught. Hence the Powell mission. Still,
opposing that advice is the dominant input of the right wing
neo-conservatives who have the upper hand in the foreign policy-national
security establishment--people like Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz,
Dick Cheney, Richard Perle.

The third impediment to a credible peace, even to a start of genuine
negotiations, is Sharon's own view of power and political realities.
Under the pretext of dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, he
launched an all-out onslaught designed to obliterate not only the
Palestine Authority, but also the economic and political infrastructure
of the Palestinians, including cultural, medical and humanitarian
institutions, indeed all the ingredients of a nation-state. His campaign
against terror has aimed at de-institutionalizing the Palestinians and
preempting a state-in-waiting, a strategy employed in Lebanon twenty
years ago.

As prime minister, Sharon has vigorously tried to browbeat the
Palestinians into submission and end their uprising against the
occupation for once and for all, forcing them either to accept a
fragmented entity consisting of four bantustans under Israel's control,
or to leave the country. Expulsion, which is euphemistically known as
""transfer"" in Zionist literature, is now supported by nearly half of
Israel's population.

Thus, any attempts by Colin Powell to broker a settlement will come to
naught unless the occupation is dismantled in accordance with
international law and the global consensus. The negotiations would have
to link the favored micro issues and the innocuous Tenet, Mitchell
cliches to the real issues, including the status of Jerusalem, rights of
refugees, water and borders. That settlement is currently being
portrayed by neo-conservatives, the pro-Israel lobby and Israel's men
and women in Congress, led by presidential hopefuls Senators Kerry and
Leiberman, as a sell-out of Israel, a cardinal sin in American politics.
On the other side, there are the pragmatists who will no doubt push for
a Madrid-style conference with a quid pro quo on Iraq. The final outcome
will result from an ongoing test of domestic political will.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak now argues that Camp
David was a kind of success, since it was proven there at a relatively
early stage that Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat was not ready to reach
a genuine agreement, thereby enabling Israel to avoid a far worse
crisis. What's your opinion: success or failure?

A: Certainly not a success. The idea was to reach an end of
conflict, and it produced the Intifada. The only dimension of success
was as a learning experience for the Israeli public regarding the price
of peace. Prior to Camp David there were lots of illusions; Peres, for
example, argued that ""with 80 percent [of the territory] we can do the
job."" On the Right, they thought we could both rule and make peace. The
fact is that Israeli public opinion acquiesced in the price we have to
pay in partitioning Jerusalem and other areas.

Q: If you could repeat the exercise, with the benefit of two
years hindsight, what would you change?

A: I would set as a condition for going to Camp David that we
insist on a preliminary leadership summit. On the first day of Camp
David we should have stopped: here we have the teams that negotiated in
the Stockholm track; now the leaders have to discuss the gaps and the
overall framework, and only after that should we return to work in
teams. I told Barak and [then-US President Bill] Clinton that we should
reverse the mechanism of the meeting: the teams are trying to guess what
the leaders will agree to. I told Barak: why did you bring us here,
after all, I can meet with Abu Alaa back in Jerusalem. We have to put
everything on the table, and if there is no agreement in the leadership
summit, that means there's no agreement. Barak's stubborn refusal to
meet with Arafat was a big obstacle.

Q: Why didn't Barak want to meet with Arafat?

A: This is a classic example of personality as impediment. Barak
is incapable of crossing cultural lines. He has difficulty functioning
in a hostile cultural environment. All of his meetings with Arafat were
catastrophes. There were meetings prior to Camp David where Barak and
Arafat sat and said nothing; he wasn't capable of speaking at all.
Arafat and Clinton had very difficult meetings, but they were substantive.

Q: You didn't deal at all with the topic of Jerusalem prior
to the summit. Isn't this a case of poor preparation?

A: This was the main topic that was not discussed in advance. On
the first day of Camp David I stated ""this is the Jerusalem conference,""
this will make or break the deal. The first positive turn of events was
when I presented my personal proposals on Jerusalem. This obliged Arafat
to be more flexible on the territorial issues.

Q: What did you learn about Arafat at Camp David?

A: He's the most impossible man you can imagine. He's actually not
a leader; rather, he's led by a series of myths, he's a kind of ""surfer""
with a few fundamental beliefs regarding the Jewish state and Islam.
Once, after Camp David, I told Arafat: you invented a movement for
liberation and national struggle along the lines of the '60s, and now,
as we approach the moment of truth, you return to Islam. Rejection of
the Israeli claim to historic entitlement over the Land of Israel is
fundamentalism.

I don't know anyone who walked out of a meeting with Arafat having heard
a single sentence that had a beginning and an end. But this is a
strategy! He won't let you entrap him on anything.

Q: Was the Israeli right wing right about him? Should we have
made a more incisive assessment of the man prior to Camp David, based on
what we knew about him before the process began?

A: In retrospect, I agree that it was an historic mistake to bring
him here; it almost cost us the State of Israel. At various instances we
should have taken stock. But as a historian I would say that only now
have the conditions developed for delegitimizing Arafat. Prior to Camp
David there were no international conditions that would permit it. Here
the right wing was right in its gut feelings both about the partner and
about the deep currents of the conflict. But the right wing was not
right about a solution, because it has no solution.

Q: Other than Arafat, how did the Palestinians function at
Camp David?

A: The internal political component in both camps was an
impediment. At Camp David we saw the older, Tunis clique vs. the younger
and more pragmatic figures. I don't know what was more important to the
older set, reaching an agreement or stopping the younger set. The older
leaders were indifferent; at times there was a sense of a leadership
that won't take its fate into its own hands. Abu Maazen was like a
tourist in a safari park. In my view they bear the primary guilt for the
Palestinian national movement's obsession with seeking justice instead
of a solution, while their younger generation at Camp David signaled
that it would concede justice for the sake of a solution.

Apropos, King Hassan of Morocco told me in January '93 that he told Abu
Maazen that the time had come for the PLO [Palestine Liberation
Organization] to let the local leadership in the territories negotiate
with Israel. In other words, he had begun to recognize that perhaps the
PLO was not a partner.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: When Palestinians left Camp David, what was the deal on
the table?

A: In terms of procedures, the deal was that no blame would be
placed on any party by the American administration. United States
President Clinton agreed to this and so did the Israelis and
Palestinians. We agreed to continue the negotiations after Camp David in
order to reach a solution.

Then Clinton said he would merely praise [former Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud] Barak and the next day, Barak broke his commitment. He held a
press conference and used the line that he 'did not have a partner.'
President Clinton also blamed the Palestinian Authority and President
Arafat in what can be considered a breach of our understanding.

Politically, there was extensive conversation at Camp David on all the
core issues. These discussions were serious, but they did not reach
agreement because the Israeli side refused--after 12 days of
negotiations--to present anything written or tangible on any of the issues.

When Clinton's initiative arrived regarding land, refugees and borders,
it was not enough to entice the Authority and the Palestinian people to
agree to a solution and an historic deal of this magnitude. On the land,
the deal was to agree that 91 percent of 1967 lands would go to the
Palestinian Authority, in addition to a one percent land swap. The total
would have been 92 percent with eight security conditions: that there
must be an Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley, a presence at
the borders, early warning stations, control over air space, that the
Palestinian state be demilitarized, three [Israeli] pathways to Jordan,
freedom for Israeli planes to fly over Palestinian airways and so on.
These conditions subtracted from Palestinian sovereignty over land not
exceeding 92 percent. It was not like what they later claimed--that a
magnificent offer was presented. It was only 92 percent.

But we are not talking about percentages as if we are in the market. We
are talking about how much the United States and Israel grew closer to
resolutions of international legitimacy, [United Nations Resolutions]
242 and 338 and the principles of land for peace, which are the
foundations of the peace process and Madrid.

The city of Jerusalem was to be divided into four categories--Al Haram,
the Old City, the surrounding neighborhoods and the villages around
Jerusalem. There were four security systems in Jerusalem and four types
of sovereignty. This was not a solution. Nothing essential could be
derived from this.

The refugee issue did not budge one inch at Camp David. There was only
talk about a ""solution"" to the refugee problem. When we reached the
conclusion that this was the offer before us, we rejected it. Evidence
that the offer was not sufficient is that later on, President Clinton
presented a more developed offer and the Israeli side at the Taba talks
came even closer to international resolutions.

Q: Was it your understanding that the talks were over and
that conflict was imminent?

A: No, the intifada arrived as a result of internal
Palestinian-Israeli circumstances. It did not occur because of planning
or ill intentions but due to Palestinian desperation after seven years
without arriving at a final agreement, the change of Israeli government
leaders every two or three months and prime ministers refusing to commit
to the agreement signed by his predecessor signed. This happened with
Peres after Rabin and Netanyahu after Peres and Barak after Netanyahu
and later with Sharon.

The intifada happened because of the loss of hope in the peace process.
We were not surprised and neither were the Israelis. In the last meeting
in Washington with Dennis Ross, two days before the Intifada erupted, I
told Shlomo Ben Ami and Gilad Sher that the situation would erupt if
Sharon visited the Haram [Jerusalem's holy mosque].

Q: What was your impression of the American role during and
after the talks?

A: President Bill Clinton was serious and conscientious and had
high hopes of ending the conflict between the two peoples. However, the
state department and White House team in charge of the file always
viewed the issue in terms of Israeli demands. They thought that every
time the Israelis conceded something, this should be enough for the
Palestinian side. It had nothing to do with the logic of justice or a
fair solution. The logic was that anything Israel was ready to
relinquish, you Palestinians should just take.

After that, Clinton put forward his ideas, which had some positive
aspects and some weak points. They were clearer than the Camp David
negotiations. But the Intifada had already begun. Mistakes were made by
the three parties in trying to save the situation. And now we have
arrived at this tragic state.

Q: As you know, Israel has been very successful in using Camp
David to demonstrate that Palestinians do not want peace. Why have the
negotiators been so reluctant to speak about the subject?

A: I personally am not reluctant. I have spoken about this publicly
to the media and in symposiums in the West Bank and Gaza. There are
negotiators who are reluctant to talk about the subject, but I am not.
Some negotiators accused me of trying to push the president towards the
agreement and that is true. It is my job to encourage the president to
reach a solution that would end the suffering of the Palestinians--but
not just any agreement, only one that the Palestinian leadership agrees
with.
"
"Isr","Neut","It seems that the attempt to achieve a ceasefire between Israel and the
Palestinians as part of the implementation of phase I of the roadmap
                     has collapsed, with a return to the usual vicious
circle of violent actions and counteractions.

The publics of the two sides accepted the short period of relative
tranquility with eagerness and a strong wish not to regress to the
former condition of violent conflict, and yet, when it collapsed, nobody
seemed to be surprised. This deserves an explanation. If the vast
majority of the two peoples wants a resumption of the peace process,
supports implementation of the roadmap and longs for an end to the
bloodshed, why are the two sides regressing to mutual violence so easily
and so quickly, and nobody is really surprised? What is the explanation
for this wide gap between public opinion and the leadership decisions of
the two parties?

One possible explanation is the discrepancy between the yearning in each
camp for tranquility and the belief that it is indeed possible. Each
party believes that its side wants a peaceful solution but that it
cannot trust the other side. Because of this mutual mistrust, neither
party accepted the roadmap in good faith and neither believed it would
really be implemented. The only purpose of accepting it was to transfer
the ball to the other's court, and create a perception among the third
parties and especially the United States that the failure was the fault
of the other party.

Another explanation is the inability of the two leaderships to change
well-rooted patterns of behavior. The Palestinian leadership continually
makes empty promises that it will deal with terrorism. Then it does
nothing, while hoping that somehow things will fall into place and
everything will be fine. When everything is not fine, they rush to utter
excuses and tell the external world the fairy tale that if they do
anything against the armed groups it will lead to a civil war. They
continually talk in two tongues, one aimed at their people and the other
aimed at the outer world, because they do not have the courage to tell
the truth to their people. They cannot stop bickering and fighting for
personal positions instead of uniting around a common positive policy
that will bring them closer to the realization of their national goals.

Israeli leaders also lack the courage to tell their people the truth;
therefore they prefer to hide behind outbursts of emotional response.
The best example is the Israeli cabinet decision to work for the
expulsion of Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat. Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon knows that it is not feasible due to international outrage.
Moreover he knows that it will not help to ameliorate the situation. But
it is very convenient for him to accept such a decision that will
satisfy the right-wing elements in his government and some angry
elements in the Israeli public, instead of telling the Israeli people
the sad truth that his policy has reached a dead end.

The Israeli government and security establishment cannot overcome their
urge to react with violence to any violent provocation by the
Palestinians, not understanding that the pacification of the Palestinian
population is a process that will take time, and that Israel's almost
automatic response does not give this process the slimmest chance of
succeeding. Nor is the Israeli leadership capable of ceasing to
personalize the problem, believing that if it gets rid of this
Palestinian person or has another Palestinian figure as its interlocutor
this will solve the problem.

Is this a hopeless situation? Can anything be done? Technically
speaking, the nomination of Ahmad Qurei (Abu Alaa) as Palestinian prime
minister provides an opportunity to resume the hudna
                                                   (ceasefire) and put
the train back on the track of implementation of the roadmap. One could
also argue that Abu Alaa has a better chance of success then former
Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), because he enjoys better
support among the Palestinian leadership and has adopted a more
intelligent modus operandi of trying to manipulate Arafat to accept his
policy instead of entering a direct public confrontation with the
Palestinian leader. It is also possible that it will be easier for
Sharon and Abu Alaa to reach an understanding regarding phase II of the
roadmap, which establishes a Palestinian state with provisional borders,
because Abu Alaa already developed the concept of such a state together
with Shimon Peres and with the backing of Sharon, when Peres was in
Sharon's government, while Abu Mazen basically objected to the concept
of additional interim arrangements.

The real problem is that the fundamental mutual distrust and the
inability of the two leaderships to get out of their familiar patterns
of behavior will mount the same obstacles against any attempt to build
something positive with Abu Alaa's government. Assuming this is the
case, it is time to return to developing ideas that seek to combine
unilateral steps by the two sides with more intensive international
involvement, as a way of maintaining a more stable and quiet situation
that could later enable the rebuilding of mutual trust and political
progress towards reconciliation.
"
"Pal","Neut","Here in the Gaza Strip, we sit and wait for the next Israeli bomb.
People feel that the next assassination of their leaders and fighters
and the civilians that happen to be standing next to them is
imminent--perhaps arriving this very moment. At the same time, there is
a sense of terrible disappointment at the chasm that opened wide within
the Palestinian Authority between President Yasser Arafat and former
Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas. These things appear to have no end in sight.

Inside Hamas, the movement is resolute to continue its attacks, since it
sees no let-up from Israel, and the /hudna                       /
(truce) or an alternative political process no longer exists. Instead,
they see Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon exploiting the delicate
situation to heighten his attacks. In particular, Hamas was bitterly
angry at the targeting of the home of Hamas political leader Mahmoud
Zahhar, when Israeli F-16s dropped a half a ton of explosives on his
house, killing women and children in the attack. So unless there is a
way opened for Hamas to talk about a new hudna, it seems very likely
that we are now descending into a situation of revenge and dramatic
escalation.

It is not that Hamas is unprepared to consider the current stage
carefully. Sometimes its leaders heed international considerations. They
don't want to be accused of being the reason for tension or the downfall
of the government. Hamas has several times offered to craft a political
agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), but has not
yet succeeded in reaching compromise with the factions that make up that
organization. And Hamas continues to fear a peace process or a crackdown
from the Palestinian Authority. The road is open for discussion with the
Authority, but both sides have their reasons for being wary of a final
pact.

It will not be easy to get out of this deep crisis, but the simplest
route lies in Israel's hands. All it would take would be an Israeli
declaration of intent to end the occupation and a moratorium on all
kinds of attacks, aggression and control that it now wields over our
heads. But as we have learned through the Zinni
                                              and Tenet
                                              proposals, the Mitchell
plan                                                  and the hudna,
short-term compromises will not succeed. Indeed, they are a waste of
time and effort and push us to the breaking point of promises lost in
the wind.

The way out for the Palestinian Authority is just as clear: there should
be no negotiations with Israel until there is a settlement freeze, a
halt to the construction of the wall, and the release of the prisoners.
This must be a serious commitment. That was Abu Mazen's problem; he
didn't stand a chance. He was deceived so many times by those in Israel
who promised him this and that honest gesture of good faith, but none
materialized. To facilitate this new strategy, the Palestinian Authority
should collect all of the Palestinian factions under one umbrella to
speak in one voice and react as one body. Only then can we form a new
unified force against the occupation. Otherwise, these continuing
disputes between Abu Mazen and Arafat, or Hamas and Fateh, or Hamas and
the Authority, are an invitation to Sharon to attack a divided cause and
reassert the military occupation against the Palestinian people.

Yes, the situation is very complicated. It would be beneficial for the
United States to exert pressure on Israel to stop its aggression, in
particular to prevent the deportation of Arafat. But the truth is that
we don't even feel the US glancing our way.

At this critical juncture, all options remain open: for an escalation of
violence or a return to negotiations. But we should not think that Prime
Minister-designate Ahmad Qurei will deliver the answers. He will face
the exact same obstacles from Israel, the US, Arafat and the Fateh
Central Committee that were the undoing of his predecessor. He will face
the very same trials.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: What is the significance of the United Nations General
Assembly resolution to turn the issue of the fence over to the
International Court of Justice in The Hague?

A: It means that the IJC will have to deal with the legal
aspects of this question. I'm afraid that this discussion will also draw
the court into basic [and] complicated issues such as the status of the
West Bank (whether it is occupied territory or territory in dispute) and
the status of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank (whether lawful
or not). It would have been wiser to leave open these controversial
issues concerning the past and the present and instead to concentrate on
the search for a compromise solution of the political conflict, namely,
to look at the future and negotiate a new objective political and legal
settlement.

There are many legal questions in the history of the conflict which have
never been solved, such as the Arab claim that the British Mandate over
Palestine was illegal, that the 1947 partition resolution [181]
                   was illegal, that the 1967 war was not an act of
Israeli self defense, etc. In the same way I would suggest not to deal
with the questions mentioned above on which we can never reach
agreement, and moreover, to look for a compromise solution whereby the
answer to those questions is not necessary

Q: Is the fence issue suitable for the ICJ?

A: There have been many cases where the court had to answer the
question whether a request for an advisory opinion was suitable for the
court. But the court has very often agreed that it should give its
opinion even if the case is rather political or concerns security issues.

Q: So this is only an advisory opinion?

A: The court has two kinds of jurisdiction. The first is to
settle contentious matters submitted only by states. The second kind of
jurisdiction is the power to give an advisory opinion that is not
binding, upon the request of a major organ of the UN or one of its
specialized agencies. When the court is asked to give an advisory
opinion, it has discretion to give or not give an opinion. Except for
one case in 1923 it has always given an opinion.

It has to look at all the aspects that are relevant, and here the matter
is very political and disputed. The question that has been submitted by
the UN is: ""What are the legal consequences arising from the
construction of the wall being built by Israel, the occupying power, in
the occupied Palestinian territories, including in and around East
Jerusalem, or described in the report of the secretary general,
considering the rules and principles of international law, including the
Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and
General Assembly resolutions?"" If the court has to answer this question
it will have to deal also with the very controversial questions I
mentioned earlier, and the answer will not help us to reach a compromise.

Q: In this respect, could you comment on the legal aspects
of the suicide bombings the fence was built to prevent?

A: The legal aspects of the case are three. First, does Israel
have the right to build a fence? The answer is that because of suicide
bombings this is an act of self-defense to reduce the danger. The second
legal question concerns the power of Israel to confiscate the land on
which the fence is built. Here Israel is careful because it does not
confiscate the land but only requisitions it and pays rent, and this is
permitted under The Hague Rules of 1907. The third question concerns
freedom of movement, which has been established by the 1966
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. There is no doubt
the fence will impair the freedom of movement of the Palestinians. Here
Israel claims it is trying to find a proper balance between its right to
self-defense on the one hand, and the need to preserve freedom of
movement on the other. Therefore Israel has promised to build many gates
and crossing points in the fence in order to reduce the impairment of
the freedom of movement. Importantly, the Palestinians themselves
acknowledge Israel's right to self defense in their legal memorandum
which is attached to the report of the secretary general.
"
"Pal","Neut","We may differ among us over the repercussions or the morality of suicide
bombings. But what we do agree on unanimously is that when an individual
insists on deploying his or her own body, a power is released that might
be called a part of the ""flesh against iron"" strategy.

The problem with the strategy of ""flesh against iron"" in this case is
that it is based on actions of an individual and hence, remains
inaccessible to the public and the nation as a whole. Indeed, the nation
is forced to stand back and watch this solitary occurrence.

Observe the events of recent weeks in the world (which were not covered
by the Arabic press, including al Jazeera satellite channel), in
particular those in Bolivia where citizens of an entire nation bared
their chests and thus forced their government to relinquish power and
authority and flee the country. The same happened in Georgia, where
continuing demonstrations resulted in the overthrow of the government
and parliament, and obligated Edward Shevardnadze to resign in the wake
of charges that he rigged the elections.

These examples are offered here merely to demonstrate that nations
possess power, a power manifested in bodies tightly pressed together and
directed at a singular goal. After close examination, it appears that we
Palestinians are in dire need of this power. Some will say that there
are already organizations that call demonstrations to resist and
denounce the building of the Israeli wall and there are international
solidarity groups that coordinate with local Palestinian movements and
organize popular activities to confront the building of this racial
separation wall. This is all well and good, I would argue, but it does
not achieve the formula of ""flesh against iron.""

What has happened in Latin America and Georgia is what social scientists
and intellectuals call ""people power."" What is taken into account here
is persistence and numbers-- numbers are decisive in implementing goals,
rather than the particular action underway. Demonstrations that are
rallied to resist the construction of the wall must include thousands,
tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands persistently placing
their bodies as a barrier in the path of this wall. To achieve these
numbers, each Palestinian movement is responsible for organizing and
mobilizing people as a way of demonstrating their active presence on the
ground, rather than simply maintaining a popular base in society.

Some non-governmental organizations that do manage to organize
activities play an important role in maintaining contact with
international groups that stand in solidarity with the Palestinian
people. However, the structure of a non-governmental organization
differs from the composition of a social or national movement, which is
responsible for mobilizing and organizing the people. Some claim that,
as a result, political organizations and parties currently play a very
weak role in the public sphere--even being completely absent at times.
Still, this does not relieve these groups' responsibility for
confronting this wall, and in invigorating and supporting the public, in
particular those who have suffered with the wall's construction.

Political movements that maintain a popular base must take
responsibility and act; this means that they must fully bear the
consequences on their shoulders, rather than acting as guests at
activities hosted by non-governmental organizations. Some will argue
that a bloodthirsty Israeli army and Israeli settlers will easily
prevent public gatherings by using excessive force. But the point here
is that the goal of these public gatherings is to prevent the excessive
use of force, because Israelis cannot kill or attack thousands of people
at once. True, this strategy demands a high level of consciousness,
commitment, organization and support. It also requires the creation of
organized political frameworks.

But right now, international advocacy is at its optimum: the companies
hired by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to polish his public image
have failed in their mission. That was clearly reflected in the latest
European poll. Too, the United Nations is becoming more direct in its
messages regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There is already a
network of international support for the Palestinian cause, and this
will help in gearing a broad popular movement to prevent the building of
the wall. It is also worth noting that most European countries and the
United States of America do not support the building of this wall.

The ""flesh against iron"" formula should not only include the public and
its organizations, parties, and civil institutions; it must also include
the Palestinian National Authority itself. Many articles have been
written about the fall of the government of Mahmoud Abbas; others are
debating the future of the current administration. I, for one, believe
that if the current government follows the lead of its predecessor in
placing our destiny at the hands of ""American and Israeli goodwill,"" and
finds no other path except ""negotiations"" and ""peace processes,"" it will
be unable to shape a future out of the numerous sacrifices of its own
people.

What prevents governments from following the ""path of peace,"" while
simultaneously organizing popular resistance? What explains the official
failure to lead public demonstrations against the building of this wall
or the spread of settlements?

The natural flow of life for all cross-sections of Palestinian society
is already impaired. What prevents us then from specifying certain days
or weeks for the public to gather around a settlement to prevent it from
spreading or to halt the confiscation of Palestinian land? What prevents
thousands from positioning themselves between the Israeli bulldozers and
targeted Palestinian homes to prevent Israel from demolishing homes in
Rafah, Jenin, or the Old City in Nablus? Yes, Israeli tanks and
bulldozers can kill a single person (as they did to American activist
Rachel Corrie), but Israel cannot kill thousands in one stroke.

What we need is goodwill, planning, organization and support. Israeli
tanks may kill tens or hundreds, but they cannot murder an entire
population. This is the value of pursuing the formula of ""flesh against
iron.""
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: When you led negotiations with Syria under the Netanyahu
government, what were your calculations regarding the effect on the
Palestinian track?

A: The driving consideration was that by activating the Syrian
track, we were also improving Israel's maneuvering space and
capabilities vis-a-vis the Palestinians. If you recall, the interim
negotiations with the Palestinians that culminated in the Wye River
Conference took place in 1998. It is no coincidence therefore that in
the summer of 1998, during the weeks and months preceding Wye,
Syrian-Israeli indirect negotiations reached their peak. The Syrians
were always surprised at the fact that each successive [Israeli] prime
minister appeared to give priority or preference to movement on the
Syrian track, a pattern that was true for Rabin, Peres, Netanyahu and
Barak. But the Syrians repeatedly found themselves stalled at the end of
the process, with the Israelis reengaging the Palestinians.

In the summer of 1998 the Syrians felt rightly that Israel was on the
verge of concluding what was to become in October the Wye agreement.
Because they had to recapture primacy they understood they had to make a
deal attractive to Israel. President Hafez Asad acted very much as ""an
old man in a hurry"", for two reasons. He realized he was nearing the end
of his role. But he also realized that an agreement with the
Palestinians was in the making. It was very much Asad who showed greater
flexibility and a willingness to conclude the deal quickly.

Q: How did this affect the Palestinians?

A: As near as I can tell they were not aware of the negotiations
[with Syria] at the time. There were fragments of gossip, but they were
not aware of the intensive shuttle diplomacy that took place in August
and September. But one cannot rule out the possibility that the
Americans, who knew about the talks with Syria, tipped them off to nudge
them towards an agreement.

Q: What has changed since then?

A: In the previous decade two considerations that affected Israeli
thinking--beyond the issues on their own merits--were the Lebanese
situation, which at the time was festering and costing us, and the
negotiations with the Palestinians. Both had the effect of increasing
Israeli interest in moving first on the Syrian front, so as to increase
our leverage vis-a-vis the Palestinians as well as to resolve the
Lebanese imbroglio by negotiating with Syria.

These calculations are no longer operative, due to three developments.
First, Israel withdrew unilaterally from Lebanon in 2000, and with all
the ensuing consequences regarding the Palestinians, this had the effect
of lessening Israel's interest in dealing with Syria. Secondly, the
demise of Hafez Asad and the emergence of his son Bashar have created a
discontinuity and a high degree of uncertainty as to whom we are dealing
with. And thirdly, the post-9/11 post-Iraq Middle East is a different
region in ways that project upon the Syrian issue in Israeli or for that
matter American eyes. The net effect of these developments is that there
is not as high an Israeli interest in moving on the Syrian track now as
there was under previous circumstances.

Q: Would you yourself recommend negotiating now with Syria?

A: Israel should certainly consider pursuing the Syrian option,
taking into account all that has changed and the new opportunities that
present themselves. This time Israel's approach would be less motivated
by the effect on the Palestinian track as connected to regional factors.
These include American objectives and Syrian weakness, but also the
shifting conditions in the Middle East as manifested by many of the
consequences of the American action in Iraq, e.g., what has happened in
Libya and Syria.

I personally believe that it would not consume too much of our energies
to engage the Syrians with a view to exploring these new vistas. There
is no rush, no urgency, Bashar Asad could very well be a young man in no
hurry and neither are we, but the changed circumstances could suggest
the possibility of a new deal with the Syrians that would better suit
the present and changing Middle East. Just as Syria has shown greater
flexibility toward Turkey, and considering that it may have new
objectives in its relations with Europe and the US, I would not be
surprised if, when it comes to the contours of a territorial deal
between us and Syria, it showed greater flexibility than in the past.

Q: So you believe the Syrians are serious?

A: I share the assessment of Israeli intelligence that Bashar
Asad's desire to engage Israel is genuine. This clearly indicates that
Bashar may be feeling pressure as well as reconsidering his
circumstances and showing an interest in changing his regional and
international conditions. This could be a signal that there may be
greater flexibility in Syria's present position which, if properly
leveraged by the US and Israel through the use of incentives and
disincentives, could result in a future deal some time down the road.
The pacing of the process could be decided taking into account the
Palestinian track so as to make sure that each is being pursued to the
limit the traffic can bear without one interfering with the other or
adversely affecting it.

Q: Will Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon negotiate with
Syria in the near future?

A: Evidently Sharon has shown little interest in pursuing that
option. Of course this could always be a tactical display of reluctance,
but it could also be genuine since his hands are full with his present
initiative on the Palestinian issue.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: If Israel resumes negotiations with Syria, what
consequences do you think this will have on the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiating track?

A: I believe that any progress on the Syrian track with Israel will
have a positive impact on the Palestinian track. I would see what the
Syrian government is requesting from the Israeli government. Any
developments satisfying these demands will strengthen the Palestinian
position in the negotiations with Israel.

Q: Do you think that current and past Israeli governments
have played off the Syrians vis-a-vis the Palestinians in the past?

A: Absolutely. Israel has tried from day one to negotiate on
separate tracks. They have always attempted to divide the Palestinian
track from the Syrian track from the Lebanese track and so forth in
order to avoid a comprehensive solution to the conflict. So it was
absolutely in the interests of Israel to have negotiations progressing
on separate tracks. The one who paid the biggest price was the weakest
party in the process being, the Palestinians first and foremost.
However, Israel has always been the strongest party and has therefore
dictated the peace negotiations from the very beginning.

Q: What do you believe are the reasons that Syrian
President Bashar Asad has offered to resume negotiations with Israel?

A: It's clear that after the war in Iraq and the immense changes
that have taken place over the past nine or ten months, Syria feels it
is isolated. President Bashar Asad has certainly realized that the space
in which he is allowed to maneuver has become noticeably smaller. In
that sense, he needs to do something more to respond to the American
demands or the Israeli demands.

Q: Do you think that there has been a difference between
the way the Israeli Labor Party has negotiated with Syria and the
strategies employed by the Likud, both in the past and in the present?

A: I always felt that Labor has the capacity to see the big picture
much more than the Likud does. The Likud Party seems to concentrate much
more on the tactics of now. Looking at the current Israeli government,
they are focused on the current situation. They are following quite a
short sighted policy. They are looking at how they can achieve the
maximum gains for the state of Israel today and I don't believe that the
gains they can realistically achieve today are the ones that will serve
them best in the long run. In that sense, Israeli Prime Minister
Sharon's Syria policy is surely not in the interests of the state of
Israel as such.

Q: What do you think the Palestinian leadership should do
if the Syria-Israel track is suddenly reopened?

A: I would do my absolute best to coordinate with the Syrian
government. It goes back to what I was saying earlier: the moment there
are separate negotiation tracks, is the moment that all Arab parties are
weakened. By agreeing to sign any hypothetical agreement alone, they
will become active participants in Israel's divide and conquer strategy.
When you look at the various tracks of negotiations that took place the
past ten years or so, I am totally convinced that Israel approached
these talks without the intention of completing a comprehensive peace.
The Israelis have been focused on trying to obtain the ""biggest"" gains
they could in the short term. Again, this is a short-sighted way of
conducting peace negotiations because any true peace must be
comprehensive. This can only be done when all parties sign off on the
agreements. The piecemeal manner of conducting these talks has only led
to disaster. There has to be a win-win situation. If one party succeeds
in forcing its entire agenda at the cost of all the other parties, it
will backfire in the end because one side will be humiliated.

Q: Do you believe that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon in
2000 has changed the equation with Syria today?

A: It surely did. Before 2000, Israel always tried to combine a
withdrawal from Lebanon with Syrian concessions on the Golan Heights.
The moment Israel withdrew from Lebanon it separated the issue of south
Lebanon from that of the Golan, thereby strengthening Syria's position
by no longer holding south Lebanon hostage until Syria retreated from
its Golan position. Until today, Syria has insisted that it will not
accept anything less than a total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan. To
be honest, I am not sure how much Bashar Asad still holds this to be
true. Given the situation in Iraq, with an American occupying force to
its east, I don't know if the Syrian government is not maybe more
willing to make concessions on the Golan.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: How do we know when the two state solution is no longer
viable?

A: The end of the two state solution will be indicated by a
situation whereby the settlements, in view of the political and
demographic force they represent, obstruct or undermine the possibility
of drawing a border between the state of Israel and the designated state
of Palestine. In other words, a border becomes politically non-feasible
for the Israeli leadership and possibly for the Palestinian leadership
as well.

We are talking here about a process. It is enough for the opposition to
a two state solution on both sides to maintain a level of violence that
prevents political agreement, to accelerate the process leading to a one
state ""solution"".

When the political costs of drawing a border exceed the gains, then a
border can only be imposed from outside.

Q: Are you suggesting that the international community
would intervene to impose a border in order to maintain a two state
solution?

A: The question is not whether they will intervene, but whether
their intervention will be vigorous enough to make a difference and
prevent the disintegration of the two state solution. For example, both
the settlers and the Palestinian extremists know the president of the
United States has to worry about elections every two years, economic
problems and other diversions. Their strategy is to create violence in
order to delay significant political and diplomatic processes,
particularly near moments of consummation, to prevent a resolution.

Q: How close are we to a point of no return?

A: Very. If Palestinian patriots and the Palestinian leadership
arrive at the conclusion that a one state solution is preferable because
they will end up with greater Palestine with a Jewish minority rather
than greater Israel with a Palestinian minority as the settlers want,
then they will actually seek this result.

Q: What will be the effect on the two societies?

A: The result will be to convince larger numbers of Israelis that
the only way to survive as a state is through massive violence against
the Palestinian population. In other words, if the course of events
leading to a one state solution is not prevented, we are likely to move
in the direction of civil war where each side seeks to exterminate and
push out the other. This will prevent either community from realizing
its capacity for a polity.

So one ongoing incentive for a two state solution should be the ability
of the Palestinian leadership to project a war that both sides will lose
and that does not result in a viable one state solution, and the ability
of the Israeli leadership to project the dangers of such a war; the
ability of leadership on both sides to show the futility of abandoning
the two state solution. This capacity to understand that we can destroy
each other is more important than, say, the leadership of President Bush.

Every leader in this region has an automatic mandate from his/her
constituency to take measures in defense of the community. No leader can
claim to have a mandate to take measures that cause self-destruction. Do
our leaders know the line that distinguishes between the two conditions?
I'm afraid they need urgent help to redraw this line.

Q: In this context, how do you assess Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon's commitment to a two state solution?

A: Sharon has resolved that if there is an unambiguous historic
opportunity to end the conflict, he will do his share. But for this
historic opportunity to be compelling to him, it has to be extremely
dangerous for Israel not to act in this way.

Sharon's definition of historic opportunity is very maximalist, due to a
lack of trust. The question is whether the Palestinians, the Arabs and
the US can seduce Sharon into reducing his expectations. For example,
right now Syria is out of the game. But if it suddenly offers to
moderate its position rather than support the extremists, this will
constitute an incentive for the Sharon government and affect its ability
to make painful compromises domestically.

Q:  How will the demise of a two state solution affect the
Jewish Diaspora worldwide?

A: The end of the Zionist dream can take several forms, including
the loss of a Jewish majority, loss of democracy, and a radical
militarization of Israeli society. It will create a split within the
Jewish people worldwide along fault lines that we can already see. On
the one hand a very small minority, 15 to 25 percent, of people who know
only ethnic solidarity and have no dreams other than survival and
revenge. This is the group that supports the settlers ideologically. And
on the other the majority, who will disengage.

Disengagement would be a tremendous blow to the idea of Jewish
collectivity; if the only expression of that idea is a form of apartheid
state, then Jewish youth worldwide will run away from Jewish identity.
That would be an ironic and tragic outcome of the Zionist movement.
Instead of becoming a spiritual center for the entire Jewish people,
Israel would become the epicenter for the disintegration of the
foundations of Jewish collectivity and solidarity in our time.
"
"Pal","Neut","My ears are full of war cries; there is no doubt that we sit on the edge
of a maelstrom of violence. But the ""peace"" that the world wishes upon
us is based on walls: a two-state proposal that is mistakenly being
called a ""solution"".

This solution will maintain the ethnic exclusivity of occupation and
propagate profound inequalities in land and resources, water, economy,
advancement and military between the two states. This solution will
reward foreign occupiers by offering them legal status and normal
relationships in the Middle East, while giving Palestinians bits and
pieces of our homeland, cantons that are separated from each other by
Jewish-only settlements and their safe roads.

This two-state solution advocates a demilitarized ""Palestinian state""
with no direct borders with any of its Arab neighbors, but surrounded by
the Middle East's only nuclear power. A ""transitional state,"" says the
American administration, that will be bestowed on one condition--that we
Palestinians behave and ""elect"" a ""reformed"" and ""democratic""
authority--and then only after another three years of occupation.

And so, while Israel continues to welcome ""refugees"" from 2,000 years
ago, extolling its war criminals as national heroes and electing them as
prime minister, we Palestinians are expected to give up the right of
return, to abandon our political prisoners and to condemn our fighters.

Palestinians are described sometimes as the last colonized people, the
last frontier of genocide and ethnic cleansing--words we deign to speak
for fear of being labeled anti-Semitic. Always we must coach our own
horror in appreciation for Jewish suffering.

At home, I look out of the kitchen window to see that the Israeli flags
have moved forward, closer to our neighborhood, demarcating the new
boundaries of the Pisgat Ze'ev settlement. The Israelis claim that they
want peace after separation--they are establishing a wall between us for
security reasons. They want separation, a separation that will ensure
that Palestinians are denied access to the land of their immediate
fathers and forefathers, while Israelis continue to traverse their
secure bypass roads to settlements lying in the heart of the Palestinian
territories.

The vision of two states does not meet any minimal ambition of peace,
freedom and a dignified future for Palestinians. It jeopardizes our
basic human and national rights of sovereignty. Except for municipal
matters like collecting our own garbage, our nation will be totally
dependent on the state of Israel. In return, we will be expected to
collect Israel's garbage, wash Israel's dishes and offer cheap labor to
our oppressors.

However, I oppose the two-state solution not only because it is
impossible, but because it is immoral.

The Palestinians are a cosmopolitan nation. We are the descendants of
civilizations that have lived in this land since the Stone Age. We have
Canaanite, Semite, Aramaic, Arab, Turkish, African and European blood in
our veins. Here we were born, and here our forefathers have lived. A
common history, a common passion for our homeland and the same
unstaunched wound unite us.

We are not xenophobic or exclusive. We are Muslims, Christians,
indigenous Jews, Baha'is and Druze. Over the centuries our doors were
open to foreigners. The Armenians fleeing genocide found shelter among
Palestinians, Africans came as pilgrims and were entranced by the magic
of Jerusalem. Early Jewish immigrants fleeing persecution were accepted
within the Palestinian community, worked with Palestinians, lived in
their towns, and intermarried with them. According to the Palestinian
National Charter, the document that lays out our national principles,
Jews who immigrated to Palestine before the 1948 Nakba are Palestinians.

Our rejection of the Zionist project is not based on hatred, but on the
rejection of foreign occupation, the theft of our homeland and
resources, and the crimes that have been committed in realizing the
dream of an exclusively Jewish state.

I acknowledge that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is very complex. The
emergence of two generations of Israelis born in the land occupied by
their forefathers makes things infinitely more confused. It means that
this conflict will not be solved until we recognize the presence and the
humanity of the other, rectify the wounds of the past, acknowledge the
wrong that has been done to Palestinians and then undo those wrongs as
best we can.

My hope lies in a multi-national, multi-ethnic democratic state of
historic Palestine for all its citizens. I do not care about the safety
of Israelis any less than I care for the safety of my own people, nor am
I suggesting that we jump into this process without preparation. We must
start by demanding that Israelis remove their armed children from our
doorsteps, with a United Nations force as a common buffer zone. We
Palestinians everywhere need to heal and work with each other to elect
new democratic representatives instead of the same tired faces. And
then, as two equal nations, we need to set out upon the business of
making right the wrongs. It is time for something new.

""You are asking us to commit mass suicide,"" one Israeli told me. No, I
am calling for Israelis' moral and ethical liberation from the sin of
occupation, for their freedom from pathological fear and the neurosis of
security, and the restoration of their human rights as equal citizens in
a free country.

This is not my fantasy--it is my enduring hope. The making right of
colonization has been achieved in recent history. South Africa is a
living example of the triumph of hope and reconciliation over oppression
and prejudice.

When Palestinians live together as equals with the people of Israel,
when not only Israeli security matters, but Palestinian security as
well, and when both of us take the same bus to work, stand at the
ministry of interior together, endure the same procedures at the airport
and have equal wages for the same jobs, then the last shall be first in
keeping the peace.
"
"Isr","Neut","Water issues can impact the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in various
ways. On the one hand the issue of allocation and control of water
resources can be a source of direct conflict and dispute. On the other
hand, due to the shared nature of the resource, which leads to the need
for joint management and protection of water resources from pollution,
there is a strong need for cooperation. Water as the basis of all life
is described as a humanitarian issue, encouraging compassion and
understanding; at the same time water is increasingly described as a
human right where misallocation becomes a breach of legal norms.

Water resources in the Israeli-Palestinian context are by definition
trans-boundary issues. Israelis and Palestinians share both groundwater
and surface water resources. The two major groundwater sources in the
region are the mountain aquifer and the Coastal Aquifer. The Mountain
Aquifer is shared by Israel and the West Bank and the Coastal Aquifer
shared by Israel and Gaza. The River Jordan is the main surface water
shared by Israel and the West Bank. In the case of the shared Mountain
Aquifer, Israel utilizes at least 80% of the aquifer's water resources
and in the case of the Jordan no access is given for direct Palestinian
use.

In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict water allocation remains a disputed
issue but, surprisingly to most people, not an impediment to progress in
peace talks. This was witnessed in the Camp David negotiations and the
Taba talks of the last days of the Barak government, where refugees,
settlements and borders were the explosive issues with water no longer
appearing in the headlines. Similarly in the recent Geneva accord
negotiated by Yossi Beilin and Yasser Abd Rabbo, the water issue is left
for later negotiation. Off the record, both Israeli and Palestinian
water officials state that the final water allocation arrangements are
more or less worked out but that they will not be declared and
implemented until a peace agreement is signed.

Leaving water arrangements to final status comes at a heavy price to
those residents that currently lack sufficient water for domestic
purposes. There are some 200 Palestinian villages that are not connected
to the water network. Particularly in days of closure they cannot even
truck in the water needed for their communities. During drought periods
Palestinian residents in West Bank cities cannot be certain of water
flowing in their taps in the summer months, often resulting in political
pressure placed on the Israeli side to increase water supply.

For the Palestinians, the Oslo process (the Israeli-Palestinian
bilateral track) and in particular the interim agreement of 1995 (Oslo
II) brought some change for the better. The process led to Israeli
recognition of ""Palestinian water rights,"" acknowledged the need for
additional water to be provided to the Palestinians, and created a Joint
Water Committee to coordinate water related activities. Under the Oslo
process significant American and European funding has gone into the
Palestinian water sector to provide more water to Palestinian cities and
towns. The fact that water negotiations remain incomplete, however, has
left Palestinians unsatisfied with the quantity of Israeli water
allocations to them and the virtual veto power that Israel enjoys in the
Joint Water Committee framework.

Nevertheless progress has been sufficient to remove the water issue from
the ""high politics"" shelf. During this latest intifada, when all other
negotiation issues came to a complete halt, both sides were able to meet
and agree to continue to cooperate on water issues. The only agreements
signed by Israel and the Palestinian Authority since the outbreak of the
intifada have both involved water issues: an agreement not to damage
each other's water infrastructure and a recent agreement on standards
for sewage treatment.

The water meetings held and the agreements signed have unfortunately
been kept out of the public eye. On the contrary, the respective
ministers responsible for water issues have issued public charges
against each other--the Palestinian charging denial of drinking water by
Israel and the Israeli charging sewage terrorism by the Palestinian
side. A recent study undertaken by Friends of the Earth Middle East
(FoEME) concerning pollution sources of the Mountain Aquifer revealed
that both Israelis and Palestinians pollute the aquifer, with 75% of the
pollution coming from Palestinian sources and 25% from Israeli sources.
Above the Mountain Aquifer, which is the most important source of
drinking water for both Israelis and Palestinians, the sewage of some
two million people, predominantly Palestinian but in no small measure
Israeli, remains either untreated or insufficiently treated.

It all could and should be different. Through a US and EU government
supported grant FoEME created 11 partnering communities in Israel,
Jordan and Palestine. Water issues were identified by FoEME as the focus
of the cross border partnership, under the project title ""Good water
makes good neighbors"". The project has witnessed hundreds of young
people from schools and community groups becoming water trustees in
their respective communities. The water trustees carry out water
awareness programs within their community and at the cross border level
conduct dialogue and where possible exchange visits with their
neighboring water trustees.

The willingness to cooperate on water issues at the community level
exists because water is understood by all our peoples as essential to
life. Due to the trans-boundary nature of the water resource and
regional water scarcity it is well understood by the general population
that when it comes to water we are dependent on each other to protect
the resource and have a responsibility to share it.

There is no justification for either side to delay final arrangements on
water issues that are ""99% worked out"". The failure of both governments
to show greater public leadership on water issues results in unnecessary
hardship of water scarcity to Palestinians and continued pollution of
scarce shared Israeli/Palestinian water resources. The experience of
FoEME demonstrates that because of the interdependent nature of the
resource, water can be the issue that helps rebuild trust between our
peoples.
"
"Pal","Neut","Much has been written about the apartheid wall and the reason for its
existence. Israel maintains that it is a temporary structure erected for
the purposes of security. Palestinians see it as a simple land grab,
designed for the express purpose of ensuring that any future Palestinian
""state"" will be no more than a collection of isolated bantustans, a
state on paper only.

Control over water resources may provide a clue as to the purpose of
this wall. Control over water resources has long been one of the primary
objectives of Israeli settlement policy, even dating back to before the
existence of Israel. From the 1930s on, the Zionist movement focused its
settlement activities on fertile land. The policy has been consistent
ever since, from the Jordan Valley to the coastal aquifers in the west
and south. It is no accident that the Gaza settlements lie on top of the
Gaza Aquifer in the Strip.

Since the overexploitation of the waters of the Jordan River and the
Coastal Aquifer, the aquifers of the West Bank, particularly the Western
Aquifer, became the center of focus. Consequently, the Israeli
occupation authorities prohibited Palestinians from digging wells in
those areas, and Israeli officials publicly stressed the importance to
Israel of maintaining control over the mountainous regions of the West
Bank that straddle the aquifer. In 1991, for example, then Israeli
Minister of Agriculture Rafael Eitan told the Jerusalem Post that
Israeli water needs made it imperative for Israel to retain control over
those areas.

Indeed, the Oslo Accords tried to cement Israeli control over the water
resources there, and as late as the Camp David negotiations the Israeli
side clearly stated that it would not accept any autonomous Palestinian
control over the Western Aquifer.

Overlay a map of the wall on a map of the West Bank's aquifers, and the
picture becomes clearer. The course of the wall neatly takes in the main
basin of the Western Aquifer. Former Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu's defense minister, Yitzak Mordechai, during his tenure
proposed that the green line should be moved 6-15 km east for this
purpose. The wall has achieved this in fact.

With complete Israeli control over the Western Aquifer, Palestinian
agriculture will cease to exist in the northern areas of the West Bank,
leaving those farmers no choice but to either become cheap labor on
Israeli settlements or seek alternative employment in the major
Palestinian cities. Some villages, including Nazlat Issa, Baqa Al
Sharqiyyeh, Izbet Jubara, and Al Tayyeh will be unable to survive,
further cementing Israeli control over the land.

This is a process that has already started. The building of the wall has
so far resulted in the confiscation of 36 ground water wells, a total
loss of 6.7 million cubic meters of water per year. A 35,000 meter-long
drip irrigation network has fallen under Israeli control, and 10,000
heads of livestock have lost access to grazing land. For the year 2003,
the cost to Palestinian agriculture production has been 2,200 tons of
olive oil, 50,000 tons of fruit, and 100,000 tons of vegetables. In
formerly fertile areas a process of desertification has begun, with
83,000 trees uprooted and 14,680 dunams already turning barren.

To illustrate the effect on a single village, Jayyus, just east of
Qalqilya, has lost 72 percent of its irrigated land to the wall, seven
ground water wells, and 300 families have lost 100 percent of their income.

The decimation of the agriculture industry could in turn also have
serious repercussions for final status negotiations over water. The
Palestinian side will find it harder to justify its claim over water
resources if its need has declined along with the industry. Its hand
will be weakened. The wall will leave the Palestinian areas dry and
thirsty, and it is designed for that purpose.
"
"Isr","Neut","Among the most contradictory features of the Israeli-Palestinian
confrontation are the preferences and positions of Israeli public
opinion. Surveys consistently show that a majority of the public is
prepared to broadly accept the Clinton parameters for a settlement,
involving the creation of a Palestinian state, the dismantling of
settlements, and some sort of division of Jerusalem. In the absence of a
negotiated settlement, an even greater percentage of the Jewish sector
favors the concept of unilateral separation, the establishment of a
security border, and the consolidation of settlements into a few main
blocs.

The Labor Party, led by Amram Mitzna, subscribes wholeheartedly to both
of these ideas, while Prime Minister Ariel Sharon favors, at best, a
much more limited, long-range interim solution, and this only after the
Palestinians eschew violence and undertake fundamental reforms. Yet
Mitzna's chances of unseating Ariel Sharon and a Likud-led coalition
government appear small, as the public steadfastly rejects blaming
Sharon for the unprecedented level of Israeli civilian casualties and
economic deterioration during the last two years. Indeed, Sharon's level
of toughness in conducting the conflict meets with broad approval by a
public which holds the Palestinian side, and Yasser Arafat in
particular, responsible for the war. At the same time, a majority of the
Israeli public continues to favor the unity government formula, and it
appears likely that it will continue to do so, namely a Likud-led
government in which the Labor Party will be a junior, but significant
partner.

In the short run, this reality holds out little hope for those
Palestinians who favor a return to the negotiating table on the basis of
the Clinton plan. Liberal and pragmatic Palestinians had drawn
encouragement from Mitzna's election in the Labor primary, for it
indicated that a significant sector of the Israeli public was seeking a
way out of the abyss into which both communities were sliding. It
reinforced their own tendency to reevaluate Palestinian strategy and, in
particular, to bring about a cessation of suicide bombings and return to
the less violent, ""popular/mass"" tactics of the first intifada.

Indeed, there can be little doubt that large-scale terror attacks will
reinforce the Israeli public's support for Sharon's hard-line.
Conversely, a whole-hearted public endorsement of Mitzna by the
Palestinian leadership, let alone active campaigning among Palestinian
Israelis, will drive Jewish voters further to the right.

But even if the Palestinians ""behave"" during the next six weeks, the
chances of defeating Sharon appear small. Israelis' faith in Palestinian
good will and intentions has been shattered (and vice versa), meaning
that no rapid shifts back towards more conciliatory postures can be
expected.

However, it will be a mistake for Palestinians to interpret Sharon's
re-election as closing the last option for ameliorating the situation.
Despite their standing as the weaker party, what they do does matter,
and will continue to help shape the contours of the conflict, including
the nature and policies of the next Israeli coalition government.

Just as Palestinians pay close attention to the internal Israeli
dialogue, so too are Israeli ears attuned to Palestinian discourse, from
Sari Nusseibeh to Hamas. This discourse, as Israelis understand it, does
not herald a fundamental softening of the Palestinian position, either
tactically or strategically. Nusseibeh, it is understood, is clearly way
ahead of the Palestinian curve when it comes to Israel's red line, the
right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and lands in
pre-1967 Israel.

There is a widespread belief within Fatah that violence makes a mockery
of Sharon's efforts and that a cessation of violence will be an
unwarranted concession to Israel (which mirrors Israeli reluctance to
""reward terror"" by dismantling settlements and withdrawing from Gaza).
The preference within Hamas and Islamic Jihad for a narrow, right-wing
Israeli government, and the Palestinian Authority's determination to
avoid excessive Palestinian civil strife, suggests that Palestinian
violence, and the forceful Israeli response that it brings, will
continue to shape the dynamics of the conflict.

What about Arafat? However critical Palestinians may be of Arafat in
private, and however much some have come to recognize him as part of the
problem, they remain unwilling and/or unable to reduce his centrality,
both as a symbol of their struggle and as the leader of their
now-tattered institutions. Israelis, for their part, almost unanimously
believe that Arafat missed the historic opportunity for an honorable
peace agreement, and is not to be trusted. Hence, Mitzna's declaration
of his willingness to resume negotiations forthwith with the PA to test
its intentions was greeted with derision in Israel, and damaged him
politically. On the other hand, the combination of Mitzna's refreshing
straight talk and the centrist nature of the Labor list of Knesset
candidates may strengthen him among middle-of-the road Israeli voters.

A formal and final end to the 100-year old conflict, let alone a
historic reconciliation between the two peoples, is clearly out of
reach. Nonetheless, after two years of violent confrontation, mutual
brutalization and dehumanization, Israelis and Palestinians both appear
to be approaching another crossroad. Clearly, there are external factors
which will heavily shape developments in the months ahead, first and
foremost the looming US war against Iraq, and its impact on all
interested parties. The Israeli elections, by themselves, are unlikely
to result in a dramatic shift in Israeli-Palestinian relations. But down
the road both communities, and particularly their political and
intellectual elites, will again face tough choices, internally and
vis-a-vis each other.
"
"Pal","Neut","In observing reactions to the coming Israeli elections, it seems clear
that, save the ""Oslo elite"" (that exclusive upper middle class created
in a time of moderation and relative wealth), the average Palestinian is
indifferent to these elections. While there are certainly those who
express the desire for Labor to win, regardless of what Labor has to
offer, most Palestinians remain cold to the elections as a vehicle of
any sort of optimism or change.

There are three things that seem to be behind that indifference. First
of all, most Palestinians are observing the trend in the Israeli
establishment towards the right wing as also a trend towards maintaining
the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Simultaneously, the
Labor Party does not seem to understand that Ariel Sharon and his ilk
are proposing total war and that Labor's only chance to win over this is
to propose a complete contrast of ""total peace.""

Granted, there are signs of a slight shake-up going in inside the Labor
party. But for the most part, the Labor candidate Amram Mitzna
articulates his program as ""Gaza without settlements."" It is not
surprising that this message has not captured the imagination of
Palestinians (nor many Israelis, for that matter). Mitzna has only gone
halfway to the understanding that beating Sharon means declaring total
peace.

As such, Mitzna seems to be abetting the general Israeli amnesia, rather
than reversing it. Speaking in Nazareth this week, Tel Aviv professor
Adi Ophir refers to what he calls ""sitationism"", where Israelis evoke
what is happening be saying that the ""situation is very bad."" This
reflects the ""short-term Israeli memory"" concerning the occupation.
Israelis prefer not to talk about it, referring instead to the last
bomb. They are living, therefore, in a conflict that has no history.

In another example, last October when Peace Now drew crowds of tens of
thousands to Tel Aviv for a peace march, the rallying slogan was ""Leave
the territories, and be ourselves again."" The Palestinians as occupied
people have no place in this formulation. In a way then, the very heart
of the Israeli discourse has returned to original Zionist ideology: a
turning inward of Jews on the land in Israel. As such, Palestinians seem
to sense that we have passed from a period of colonial establishment to
a period of colonial society (reflected in at least the majority of
Israeli society).

Finally, at the start of the Oslo interim period, Palestinians really
believed that the small dividends would expand and result in more
compromise. The failure of this optimism has made Palestinians lose hope
in the ability of Israeli internal dynamics to act and push for a real
solution. Now Palestinians feel that the only hope is for external
factors to influence Israel. Take the case of Algeria. For the French
people, Algeria was a problem far away; it had little to do with their
lives. It was American pressure on De Gaulle, not the clamoring of the
French public, that finally turned the tide for the banishment of the
French colonial system.

The Palestinians are suffering under a very real and normal occupation
and their resistance is a real and normal push for decolonization. The
specificity of this conflict is the total hypocrisy that exists on the
part of the international community. We know that this comes from guilt
and the history of the Holocaust, but its result has been that the
international community simply keeps dumping money into Palestinian
society, supporting its elites and keeping the society at large
resuscitated just enough to prolong the occupation, but not enough to
allow it to really come alive and throw off the colonial
master.
"
"Isr","Neut","The Israeli public decided to dismantle settlements long ago, as
evidenced by its overwhelming support for PM Sharon's disengagement
plan, including the removal of all the Gaza Strip settlements and four
in northern Samaria.

Indeed, it was only public pressure that led Sharon to initiate his
withdrawal plan in order to generate a political departure that would
extract us from the bloodshed of recent years. This is good news for
those who support the peace process or the ending of occupation
unilaterally.

The settlers, and particularly their extremist leadership, the Yesha
Council, understand that the decision has fallen. From their standpoint
the only way to thwart this move is to prove that it's not feasible.
They are using heavy ammunition: threats to attack soldiers and
assassinate the prime minister, massive disobedience, and above all,
civil war. We, they declare, will have no mercy if you don't accept our
stand and our outlook.

The settlers are exploiting the sense of shared fate and collective
sacrifice held by the citizens of a nation state. Most Israelis find it
difficult to bear the sight of security personnel behaving aggressively
and violently toward Jews; those images are liable to cause the entire
enterprise to fail.

A civil war scare campaign is spreading horror throughout Israeli
society. Its effectiveness is liable to deter us from seeing this
conflict through to its end.

Accordingly, in order to ensure that disengagement takes place without
pushing the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) into a dangerous corner in the
national consciousness, the government must announce a timetable for
taking all necessary measures to remove the settlers from Gaza with
respect, sensitivity, and attentiveness to their needs and their
protest, including financial and other compensation designed to ease the
transition and adjustment.

At the end of this period, following sincere efforts to remove the
maximum number of Gaza and northern Samaria settlers--and at a later
stage the rest of the settlers in the West Bank and Gaza--the State of
Israel will withdraw to an international border recognized by the United
Nations and the world community. From this time on, the remaining
settlers will be permitted to return to Israel's sovereign territory in
accordance with the Law of Return.

These steps will spare us the television images of tear gas, billy
sticks, and women and babies being dragged on the ground, and will
deflate the settlers' struggle. The government must not provide a stage
for the provocative, ""heroic"" and determined demonstration of opposition
that constitutes the settlers' strongest weapon. Only in this way can we
have a legitimate ideological, political and democratic debate, free
from threats and brutality.

This, then, is the right decision politically and strategically. There
remains the question: if the IDF withdraws from the Gaza Strip, what
happens to the stubborn settlers who prefer to remain in place, without
protection, without infrastructure and without sovereignty? Are we not
responsible for their welfare? What is the obligation of the state to
protect its citizens that are violating its laws and decisions outside
its borders? These are weighty issues.

The dismantling of settlements will determine whether Israel remains a
national Jewish state. Conceptually (not tactically), anyone seeking to
thwart the disengagement by force is a ticking bomb that must quickly be
neutralized. Dismantling settlements is a vital condition for the
existence of the state. Whoever thwarts it endangers the state's future.
When the future of Israeli society is weighed against the fate of a
group of citizens who opt to endanger themselves, the answer is clear.

In parallel, the Palestinian Authority, in full coordination with
Israel, will take security responsibility for the lives of those Israeli
citizens--if there are any--who choose to remain on its territory.

A variety of surveys conducted among the West Bank and Gaza settlers
describes them as a responsible and pragmatic community that will not
betray the interests of the country. Only a minority of between two and
six percent testifies that it will invoke illegitimate and illegal means
to combat the disengagement. These few thousand are holding an entire
country hostage. It's time to turn the tables and say to them: no, you
will not control our fate; the state will dictate your fate in a spirit
of responsibility for all its citizens. Without broad public support,
the vocal determination of this minority will weaken. Withdrawing the
IDF, coupled with an unequivocal statement against forcible removal,
will narrow the confines of the conflict and channel it to legitimate
and democratic paths.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: The possibility has been raised that the Israeli army
might leave settlers behind rather than confront them under Sharon's
disengagement plan. How do you think such a scenario might play out?

A: Well I don't think this would ever happen. It's absolutely out
of the question for the Israelis to ever leave anybody behind. Of
course, they could be using this tactic to force the settlers out.
Without mutual guarantees for the safety of these settlers it is
absolutely impossible for any Israeli government to risk the lives of
any Israeli citizens. So I think it's a tactic to scare the settlers.

Q: It does seems that Sharon is in a bind here. He appears
to want to leave Gaza and the settlers are putting up strong opposition.
If that is true and the settlers are not going for compensation, he is
left with two options: either to confront them with the army or leave
them behind.

A: As I say, I think Sharon is using this as a scare tactic. I
don't believe any Israeli government will leave Israeli citizens behind,
they are sacred, you know. But it is perhaps used as a tactic to say
that ""if you want to stay behind you can stay, but then you will be at
the mercy of the Palestinians who will probably eat you because they are
cannibals.""

There is some talk about an exchange of populations between Israelis and
Palestinians under a final status agreement in which some Jewish
settlers who wish to stay behind, become Israeli citizens under the
jurisdiction of the Palestinian state, and some Palestinians become
Palestinian citizens under the jurisdiction of the Israeli state. But,
if this happens is has to be by mutual agreement and with safety and
security measures.

But at this stage, after four years of an intifada that has been so
violent, it is impossible to think that any responsible Israeli
government would even venture this.

Q: What would happen?

A: They would be killed for sure. There is so much hatred,
particularly in Gaza, against the settlements and the settlers. The
whole resistance movement in Gaza is actually focused on the settlements.

Q: The PA would then be put in a very difficult situation?

A: The Authority would not be in any position to protect these
settlers. It would risk its own security. People would attack the
Palestinian security officers. I don't think anyone could guarantee
their safety.

Q: On the one hand, the Israeli government is reluctant to
confront its settlers, yet on the other, it is asking the PA to clamp
down on Hamas and other groups. What's going on here?

A: I think there are some elements within Israeli society and the
government that understand that any kind of peace agreement would damage
Israel's chances of expansion, and they don't want this to happen. The
risk of civil war in Israel is quite real. So in a way, some extremist
Israeli elements fearing the possibility of civil war in Israel are
exporting the possibility of civil war to the Palestinians themselves.
Sharon has cut off talks with the Palestinian side and has started to
unleash his army against Gaza, because he wants Palestinians to fight
each other. He is exporting the danger of civil war. He is showing his
people that he is a strong man and he is forcing the Palestinian side
into action, hoping perhaps that this will help him secure his
disengagement plan without risking a civil war.

Q: From the perspective of the international community
isn't there a consistency problem here? On the one hand you have a clear
demand on Palestinians that they confront the armed groups, and on the
other hand you have settlers who under international law are living
where they are illegally. If the international community was to be
consistent shouldn't they demand that both be confronted?

A: Absolutely. There is no way, to my mind, that in Gaza even one
settler will be tolerated. There will be continuous war if any settlers
are left and no one from the Palestinian security forces could protect them.

But I think that Sharon is simply giving settlers an ultimatum, to make
them think they might be left at the mercy of the Palestinians. When we
talk about the hardcore of these settlers, these are basically racist
people. This hardcore might stay and fight, they might be affected by
the Masada complex, but they would not want to be left at the mercy of
the Palestinians, because basically they look down upon us. We are not
equal to them. They are the chosen people on their promised land. We
don't deserve to be even breathe the same air.
"
"Isr","Neut","Forty years ago, political and economic conditions in Asia (except
Japan) and in the Middle East (except Israel) shared a number of
characteristics. Both regions were deeply embedded in the gloomy ""Third
World."" Most governments were controlled by small and corrupt elites,
supported by the military and other security forces. There was no room
for tolerance or pluralism, and the economies were also stagnant.
Violence and conflict were endemic, both internally and between nations.

Since then Asia, including China and India, has made tremendous
progress, both economically and politically, but the Arab Middle East
remains stuck where it was in the 1960s. With the partial exception of
the petroleum exporting countries in the Gulf, poverty has become even
more deeply embedded, and the political systems remain closed. Leaders
are installed for life (and beyond, with the advent of ""presidential
succession"" in Syria).

In addition to the huge price paid by the citizens of these countries,
such conditions feed the frustration that turns into terrorism and
violence, and the spillover hinders efforts to negotiate a solution to
the Arab-Israel conflict. While the debates continue over the claim that
democratic societies are less war-prone than dictatorships, there is
good reason to accept the validity of this general link, even in the
Middle East.

In this environment, the removal of Saddam Hussein and regime change in
Iraq could trigger a domino effect throughout the Arab world, from North
Africa to the Gulf. While no one can predict what will happen on ""the
day after"" the war ends, regime change in Baghdad seems to be
unavoidable. Iraq may become unstable and break apart into different
sections, or its different factions could develop a durable working
relationship, allowing for rapid recovery. The current regime may be
replaced by another narrow and closed military or tribal leadership,
continuing the old pattern, but the more optimistic scenarios envision a
more open and responsible government, with at least a modicum of
democracy and tolerance for different views.

Once the floodgates open, the climate of fear in Iraq is lifted, and the
population begins to celebrate its restored freedom, the citizens in
neighboring countries around the Middle East will be infected. Dramatic
leadership change in Baghdad will launch a chain of similar (but
internally propelled) processes in the region.

After Iraq, the Palestinian Authority might well be the next in line.
The Arafat regime has dominated Fateh, the Palestine Liberation
Organization, and then the Palestinian Authority, with no lasting
accomplishments. The hope created with the 1993 ""Oslo agreements"" has
been destroyed by terrorism and violence. Israeli troops have returned
to the cities, and the creation of a Palestinian state seems as far off
as ever. The economic development that was promised a decade ago has
also failed to materialize, with the blame falling on the corruption and
incompetence of the leadership. Within Palestinian society, this
criticism is growing, coinciding with the demand for regime change in
President Bush's speech of June 24, 2002 on Middle East peace. Thus, the
forces unleashed by the replacement of Saddam Hussein could provide the
catalyst for ushering in a new, more open and democratic Palestinian
society ready to cooperate with Israel in a two-state framework.

To be effective, whether in Baghdad or Ramallah, regime change must be
structural, and not merely the replacement of one dictator or elite with
another. A post-Arafat Palestinian leadership that is under the control
of one particular faction (Hamas or Fatah) and continues to use violence
and fear to maintain power will not change much, either in the political
realm or in terms of economic development. In order to make progress
toward these goals, the new structure must allow for debate and
competition between different ideas, checks and balance among the levers
of power, transparency, and accountability.

The same factors are necessary for the societal transformation that will
lead to peace, and the replacement of rejectionism with acceptance of
the legitimacy of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. While there
are no guarantees, there is at least the hope that in a more open
political atmosphere, the one-sided history and incitement will give way
to mutual acceptance and a stable peace. A leadership that is
accountable to its citizens would also restore the credibility of
Palestinian pledges with respect to preventing terrorism and in other
critical areas.

As in the case of Iraq, it is probably unrealistic to expect an
immediate transition from the closed ""old guard,"" which has controlled
Palestinian politics for so long, to an open fully democratic political
structure. However, elements for the first stages in this process
already exist, in different forms. Discussions of Palestinian leadership
reform in the past few months, and the circulation of a draft
constitution with provisions for cabinet-based government, are important
elements in this process.

These changes will not be taking place in a vacuum, and parallel
processes are likely to begin in other countries such as Syria and
perhaps Saudi Arabia, in addition to the example expected from Iraq.
While the first priorities will be toward internal political and
economic change, these foundational elements could also help to reopen
the path to peace throughout the region.
"
"Pal","Neut","It is crucial to understanding the outcomes of a possible war in Iraq to
first examine the sentiments of the Palestinian people and their
leadership. All indications are that Palestinians in general oppose a
United States war on Iraq--not because we are sympathetic to the Iraqi
regime, but because we think war is unfair for the Iraqi people. Since
evidence has not shown that Iraq maintains weapons of mass destruction,
and since the United Nations has come out quite neutral on Iraqi weapons
possession, Palestinians have more ammunition for their belief that the
Iraqi people have the right to be left in peace. In this context, we
believe that such an attack epitomizes United States' hegemony in the
Middle East, polarizing opposing sentiment not only among Palestinians
and the Arab masses, but also among Europeans.

In this way, as in others, the situation today is different than it was
in 1991. For the last 11 years, there has been an embargo imposed on
Iraq. The Americans and British have been continuously raiding the Iraqi
no-fly zone. Why then is it strategically important to have an all-out
war right now? Is the reason to get rid of the personage of Saddam
Hussein, or is it to gain total control of Gulf oil and curb any
European, Japanese, Russian and Chinese influence in the Gulf region, as
well as control the Caspian Sea?

There is only one honest inference: that America today is playing the
hegemonic role of a superpower. The result is that many US allies are
finding themselves in an opposing camp and the Palestinian position is
not an exception; theirs is a position derived from broader public
sentiment.

As to how Palestinians will fare in this war, there are several
possibilities. All depend on the unfolding of events and how this war
takes shape. If the Americans and their allies can get the job done in a
blitzkrieg with minimal cost in American life, deposing Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein and imposing a ""viceroy"" on Iraq, then perhaps the
consequences for Palestinians will be light.

The American people have mixed feelings about this war and favor a quick
resolution. Therefore, if the duration of US occupation of Iraq is
prolonged, or if there are heavy American casualties, or if hostilities
rise against the American presence and against American politics in the
Middle East, then I think the US government will face difficulties.

In parallel, the situation in Palestine will deteriorate. Ariel Sharon's
elected government will have a free hand in intensifying the conflict.
He could resort to the expulsion of some symbols of the Palestinian
leadership, be they from Fateh, the secular political factions or Hamas
and Islamic Jihad. We might see a total siege on the occupied
territories, with long hours of curfew imposed by the Israeli army and a
crackdown on the infrastructure of the Palestinian Authority. This is
the extreme scenario.

But if the war in Iraq is limited, and there is the creation of a new
government, possibly even with Hussein himself, then I think that the
Americans will want to deal expediently with the other destabilizing
factors in the Middle East. There will be an intensive diplomatic
onslaught after they finish the job in Iraq to implement the roadmap
initiative. Already, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has acquiesced
to the idea of nominating a prime minister, as per American, European
and Israeli requests. In one way or another, he now must concede some of
his political power to be reinvested in the prime minister's office.
Second, we could have early elections for the Palestinian Legislative
Council, eventually moving to the interim and final phases of the
roadmap, which include acknowledgement by US President George W. Bush of
an independent Palestinian state.

The contours and shape of that state will be decided after the
Palestinian elections and the appointment of a prime minister, when
Sharon will be forced by the American administration to re-engage in a
political process. Still, the contours of the state will be open to
negotiations. At that point we will be in a situation where the cycle of
violence stops, the Israelis start withdrawing, and there is an easing
of economic tensions. If Arafat is engaging in a context of real
political reward, he will likely take a tougher stand against all kinds
of violence against Israelis. Here we will see a breakthrough.

That is not to say that the negotiations, even in this optimistic
scenario, will be easy. I predict a tortuous task, where we will not be
offered the 1967 borders, and we will not have all settlements
dismantled, and the question of the right of return will be compromised.
This will put the Palestinian leadership in an awkward and critical
position: how to sell this to the Palestinian people.

And, indeed, there are also two scenarios here. The Palestinians could
be sick and tired and feel they have paid enough, with 65 percent
unemployment and almost 60 percent of the population below the poverty
line. Or they may not accept any of this and desire to continue the
Intifada until freedom and independence. Those who carry this notion of
freedom and independence, given the conditions of war in the Middle
East, given the US role in the Middle East and total support for the
Israeli government, will be acting unpragmatically in a new
international context. The Americans will do all that they can to tip
the balance of their actions in Iraq and to try to find a solution for
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that fits this ""new Middle East"" and
their own strategic goals.
"
"Isr","Neut","On September 12, 1993, while Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) waited excitedly
on the White House lawn alongside Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres and Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasir
Arafat, stealthy hands implanted a listening device in his office in
Tunis. Adnan Yasin, a Palestinian recruited in Europe by the Israeli
Mossad, took advantage of his boss's absence and moved in new office
equipment imported from Europe that contained a sophisticated monitoring
device.

Thus it appears that even after the signing ceremony for the Oslo
agreements, the Israelis insisted on checking the credibility of the
Palestinian architect of their discreet contacts with the other side.
Does Abu Mazen repeat to Arafat the promises he makes to Israel? Does he
intend to honor the mutual recognition agreement? And in general, how
does he conceive of the future relationship?

There were three corollaries to the Israeli operation: the listening
equipment was discovered in an embarrassing incident; Adnan Yasin was
held for questioning and thrown in jail; and Abu Mazen ""passed the test""
and was certified as credible.

In the ensuing ten years, Abu Mazen has undergone additional credibility
tests, and not only by Israel. Every time a disagreement has emerged
between him and Yasir Arafat, he has opted to take his distance. He
would move to Amman, Tunis, Qatar or Saudi Arabia until things quieted
down. In his ""court"", which he took care not to turn into a center of
power that might threaten Arafat, there have gathered Palestinian
moderates. They will presumably accompany him when he occupies the prime
minister's office and appoints his ministers.

In Israel, even among Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's close entourage,
there are no complaints against Abu Mazen. Israel could not ask for a
Palestinian partner more moderate in his political approach, pleasant,
informed, and determined to achieve a genuine agreement for coexistence,
perhaps even peace.

The question, of course, is how independent he will be in making
decisions and appointing officials. Does the devious Arafat intend to
allow Abu Mazen to be little more than the ""nice face"" of the
Palestinian Authority vis-a-vis the United States administration and PM
Sharon, who in turn continue to boycott Arafat? Or will Abu Mazen
receive and/or seize active authority--to run negotiations regarding the
roadmap, and to rebuild Palestinian security institutions that will move
with determination to stop terrorist attacks?

Abu Mazen gave clear expression to his opposition to terrorist attacks
on Israelis in a lecture delivered several months ago in Gaza. That
resolute declaration was well publicized in Israel and in Washington,
and won him points that generated massive pressure for his appointment.
In contrast with Arafat, whose signature decorates official documents
that reflect his involvement in terrorist attacks and funding for
terrorists and who talks in circles, Abu Mazen has never been caught out
involved in or encouraging terrorism. He is an opportune partner for
Israel, on condition that Arafat allows him to operate independently and
he masters the very difficult formula for stopping terrorist activities.

In this regard it is notable that in Israeli eyes, the Israel Defense
Force's current efforts against Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist
centers are intended to ease Abu Mazen's entry into his new position.
Given the Israeli consensus in favor of boycotting Arafat, Israelis are
barely containing their satisfaction and stifling their delight with Abu
Mazen's appointment. Of course the more they smother him with
compliments, the more they will hurt and weaken his standing.

But how will Abu Mazen deal with the status of Jerusalem, the refugee
problem, and the economic corruption within Palestinian Authority
institutions? Palestinians are already pinning their hopes on him to
produce a Palestinian state. Yet the Israeli side is working on a model
of a Palestinian state that has no independent political security
institutions, and only a weak link between the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank.

Thus Abu Mazen is taking on a national task that looks almost like a
mission impossible from the Palestinian standpoint. The extremist
organizations, including those of Fateh, are just waiting for him to
falter--almost as eagerly as those among us who oppose dismantling
settlements and reject painful concessions are busily downplaying the
importance of the new figure in the Palestinian Prime Minister's Office.

Then too, the fragmented and divisive Arab world will not easily play
the role of cheerleader as the new Palestinian prime minister seeks to
establish his authority. True, Arafat has been removed almost entirely
from the phone lists of the Arab leaders. But the door currently being
held open for Abu Mazen in Cairo, Riyadh, Damascus and Amman is liable
to be slammed in his face if he does not succeed in finding a formula to
persuade all concerned that he has not become an American marionette or
an Israeli collaborator, and that he has not crossed the line with
regard to the key components and character of a Palestinian
state.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: When did the discussions over a Palestinian prime minister
first begin?

A: Four years ago we began discussing this kind of change, but
for administrative reasons, not for political reasons. For a long time,
we discussed the issue with Chairman [Yasser] Arafat, but he always
refused. He wanted one man in charge of things, not two. But after the
pressure brought to bear by Europe and the United States, then he
finally agreed.

Q: Why is it important, from your perspective, to appoint a
prime minister?

A: We need to have an authority to coordinate between the
ministers and we want to have one man to ask questions of in the
Palestinian Legislative Council. According to the Basic Law, we cannot
ask Chairman Arafat [the administrative questions that we have]. We need
someone to take responsibility for the ministers; this is important for
us as we organize and clean house.

Q: What do you think will be the prime minister's most
important duties?

A: It will definitely be the internal situation. He must have
full authority over all of the internal situation: ministers, the
economy, local security. All executive authority must be in the hands of
the prime minister.

Q: What powers did the Legislative Council grant the prime
minister?

A: We created a separation between the office of president and
the executive branch. We gave full authority to Abu Mazen in local
politics, but not in terms of political issues. Here Chairman Arafat is
number one, because he is chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization. But I think that Arafat wants to change this point.
Perhaps he himself wants to be head of the ministers.

Q: Are there some people who do not want Abu Mazen (Mahmoud
Abbas) to be appointed as prime minister?

A: No, all of [the mainstream political faction] Fateh
supports him. But maybe Arafat won't. I think that Arafat would have
preferred a technocrat, rather than a political figure--but we refused.
We Palestinians are not a regular case. We have very big problems and we
need a political man [to handle them], a man from the Fateh family. We
need a strong man, not one who will start from zero.

Q: Do you feel that current interior minister Hani Al Hasan
has been successful in managing Palestinian security issues and how do
you think Abu Mazen will fare in this regard?

A: We must give [Al Hasan] more time, but now everything is in
the hands of Abu Mazen. If Abu Mazen wants him, OK, but [Abu Mazen] will
now create a new government and chair that government and it will be up
to him to decide. I am only afraid that Arafat wants to be a partner in
the government.

Q: There are some people who oppose the appointment of a
prime minister?

A: I think that the average person just doesn't care, but some
of the opposition parties, like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, are opposed.

Q: When you look at Palestinian democracy today, how would
you describe it?

A: I think that we need democracy, but our situation is very
difficult. How can we reform and build democracy with the occupation,
and alongside the Israeli closure? This is very difficult at the same
time that we need a new political system. We must establish real
democracy because without this, we cannot build our state. Democracy is
[therefore] very important to us.
"
"Isr","Neut","The resumption of high-level dialogue between the Bush administration
and the Palestinian Authority represents a visible change in American
diplomacy, which has all but ignored the PA in recent months.
Nevertheless it is an empty gesture, meant to appease the growing
anti-American sentiment in the Arab world and to offset the obvious
""tilt"" of President George W. Bush in support of Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon. No meaningful results can be expected from the meetings
between the Palestinian premier, Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) and senior
American officials. They should be considered photo-ops, with little
content or lasting influence.

Abu Ala is too weak politically to deliver anything, just like the other
players in the Israeli-Palestinian-American triangle. Sharon is licking
his wounds after his defeat in the Likud referendum over his
disengagement plan to remove Israeli settlers from Gaza and the northern
West Bank. His plan frozen, Sharon is trying to forge a cabinet majority
for an updated version, while waiting for the attorney general's
decision over his possible indictment for bribery. Bush's war in Iraq
has soured, and he is facing a neck-to-neck reelection race, where
Jewish votes and contributions could play a crucial role.

The ""virtue of weakness"" has been tried before as a recipe for Middle
East peacemaking. It was the basis for Ehud Barak's daring openings
towards Syria and the Palestinians when he was prime minister. The idea
was that for politically weak leaders--aging Arab rulers, a
coalition-dependent Israeli premier, and an outgoing American
president--taking bold decisions could be the best survival strategy.
But herein lies the paradox, since the political weakness itself is the
barrier to progress. Barak's gamble failed, and the peace process
collapsed into the current Israeli-Palestinian war. In comparison,
present-day leaders are even weaker than in 2000.

Abu Ala's position appears unbearable. Having no real authority, he is
totally dependent on PA leader Yassir Arafat. Abu Ala's job security
depends on being a figurehead, a moderate buffer between the boycotted
Arafat under house arrest and the rest of the world. Any attempt by Abu
Ala to show independence would inevitably be refuted by Arafat, whose
strategy is to sit tight and let the Israelis sink in the mud of Gaza
and the West Bank until they leave in despair. Obviously, Arafat has no
interest in the political and security reforms called for by the
roadmap, which would strip him of his power.

Sharon has all but sidestepped Abu Ala. Their proposed meeting, rejected
at first by the Palestinians, was put off indefinitely by Sharon
following a terror attack in the port of Ashdod in March. Sharon's
unilateral disengagement plan leaves no role for the PA, either before
or after Israel's proposed withdrawal. Israeli officials have also tried
to convince the Americans that Abu Ala is useless, hence the need for a
unilateral approach to break the deadlock.

The Palestinians have made no real effort to improve their image in
America, sensing perhaps that Bush favors Sharon anyway, especially when
he craves Jewish electoral support. Moreover, American-Palestinian
relations are still clouded by the failure of the PA to catch and punish
the killers of three American security guards in Gaza, seven months ago.
Last week's deadly events in Gaza have further exposed the PA's
irrelevance and incompetence. Negotiations for returning the captured
body parts of dead Israeli soldiers involved Egypt, the Islamic Jihad
and local security chiefs. The PA leadership in Ramallah played
virtually no part in the deal, according to Israeli officials.

The Bush administration was surprised by Sharon's failure in the Likud
referendum, but quickly decided to ignore it. The Americans appropriated
the plan and tried to sell it to their European and Arab friends, thus
preventing Israel from turning back. They viewed Sharon's loss, and the
vacuum it created, as an opportunity to repair their deteriorating
relations with the Arabs, following the atrocities at the Abu Ghraib
prison in Iraq and Bush's written promise to support Israel's positions
on borders and refugees in a future final-status deal with the
Palestinians. The chosen vehicle was Abu Ala, who was suddenly pulled
out of the diplomatic freezer.

The Americans have learned the lessons of their overenthusiastic welcome
last year to Abu Ala's fallen predecessor, Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas).
They decided to give Qurei a more lukewarm treatment, and refrained from
inviting him to Washington, meeting him instead in Jordan and Germany.
According to Israeli sources, Bush's letter to Abu Ala was full of
demands about fighting terrorism and PA reform. Even the most optimistic
American officials expressed virtually no expectations from the meetings
with him, while the Palestinians wanted mainly to appear relevant to a
future negotiated process

Sharon senses the weakness on the other side, and has chosen to dismiss
the new American-Palestinian hugfest. Sticking to his unilateral
approach, he rejects suggestions to renew negotiations with the PA, and
pays only lip service to the roadmap                        . Sharon's
survival depends on forging a new majority within Likud, and slipping
out of indictment. Abu Ala cannot possibly help him on these two fronts.

"Pal","Neut","Today I went to the community center in my town of Rafah, here in the
southern Gaza Strip, only to find people frantic with worry. Israeli
tanks have closed off our town and there are reports, even now, of more
tanks being moved in to the border area between Gaza and Egypt. Several
of us in the community took it upon ourselves to try to calm the
residents, many of whom were packing their things and abandoning their
houses in fear that Israel would fulfill its threats to demolish them.

You must stay, we told them. We cannot have a third catastrophe. We have
lived two wars and left two homes. We have no option but to stay.

Rafah has had more than 1,100 homes demolished over the course of the
last three years. Those who have been made homeless are now renting in
other parts of the town, but there are no more homes to rent. Outside
this very community center, there are families living in the soccer
field. Some are staying in schools at night, and still others are living
in tents in the street.

We told them that there are contacts between the Palestinian Authority
and the United States, between Egypt and Israel. But who can say what
will happen to these people in the coming hours? Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon wants to finish off Rafah, and if he wants to level the whole
place, he will.

I heard what Secretary Colin Powell and National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice said about the Palestinians after their meetings with
the Palestinian Authority. And I have to say that they are fooling no
one. While the Americans want to appease the Arab world by showing that
they are meeting with our leadership, the truth will be written in my
town, perhaps tonight. The common denominator between this American
administration and Israel is their mutual wielding of power and
violence. Together, Israel and the United States have chosen to isolate
the Palestinian Authority. Now we will see if the United States will
sanction more bloodletting of innocents. Rafah is surrounded by Israeli
checkpoints and settlements and our people have no escape.

And I believe it will be a massacre if the Israeli military enters Rafah
in order to demolish those homes along the Gaza border. People here are
preparing themselves. They will not surrender to the bulldozers in
silence. The Israelis will come with many weapons, and the Palestinians
will use what they can.

Two nights ago, two missiles were fired from a helicopter at two in the
morning into the offices of my newspaper, al Risala. The computers, the
furniture lie in smithereens. That office sits in the middle of a
residential area in Gaza City. Israel is trying to smother even our
ability to speak.

Mr. Bush, you have the power of the presidency in your hands. I believe
that you know the truth. You know that the Palestinian people are living
under a terrible occupation. You know that our days and nights are
haunted by screeching missiles flung from the sky. You know that the day
that we do not see death is a rare day in our lives.

How then do you, as a man committed to democracy, agree with Sharon's
practices? I am asking you now to live in our tragedy, to listen to the
crying of our frightened children, to hear the frantic voices of my
people. Listen very well, and then decide.
"
"Isr","Neut","What was each side's strategic objective in the peace process during the
years 1999-2001?

Israel sought to exploit the chance to reach a framework agreement on
final status that would constitute the end of the conflict and resolve
all mutual demands. The government of Ehud Barak opted for a political
process that would focus on what is genuinely vital: the long-term
existence of a Jewish democratic state within internationally-recognized
borders; the strategic goal of a stable and fair peace, one that would
endure even at times of crisis.

The Palestinian concept was not monolithic, but can be generalized as
based on emotions of justice and grievance, and on the exploitation of
political negotiations as an additional phase in a clash of cultures and
as an instrument for righting an historical wrong. A political solution
was understood by some in the Palestinian leadership (first and foremost
Yasir Arafat) as a temporary, tactical tool, one not intended to bring
about an end of conflict, but rather only to enhance the Palestinian
position in anticipation of the next phase in the struggle.

This conceptual gap affected the unfolding of events far more than the
mistakes made by each of the parties and the mistrust that characterized
their relationship along the way.

Is it really possible to solve such a complex, multi-dimensional,
ethnic-religious-national conflict by means of political negotiations?
The final status issues for the most part have multi-dimensional
ramifications: national, emotional, primordial, religious, existential,
sovereign.

The government of Israel replied in the affirmative. From its
standpoint, this was a conscious decision in favor of a painful historic
compromise that would respect the rights of the other side: ending the
occupation through mutual compromise.

Evidently, though, this would not have been the Palestinians'
perception, had they been asked at the time. Their suspicions that
Israel was seeking a way to deceive the world and perpetuate the
occupation prevailed over any logical explanation. As they see it, time
is on the side of the Palestinian cause. Hence there cannot and will not
be an end to the conflict, neither officially nor at the practical level.

Against this backdrop of each side's political strategy, we can now
analyze their tactical approaches.

The Barak government had to choose one of two options: a FAPS--Framework
Agreement on Permanent Status--that would deal with all ""core issues""
(settlements and territory, borders, refugees, Jerusalem and security
arrangements) and determine for each a substantive solution and the mode
and duration of its realization; or an additional interim agreement that
would postpone dealing with the heart of the conflict.

The permanent status issues are interlinked, rendering it impossible to
isolate any single issue from the others. The approach adopted by the
Israeli negotiators was predicated on a readiness to discuss
far-reaching ideas for solving all these issues, as long as nothing was
considered agreed and binding until everything was agreed.

Accordingly, we focused on an attempt to find the common denominator,
and devoted most of our time to this endeavor. Through an analysis of
shared interests (e.g., peace, a practical solution to the refugee
problem, security separation, economic prosperity) there emerged over
time additional options for a settlement, along with creative bridging
formulae. From the outset Barak was prepared to make an historic
decision, and this approach informed the instructions he gave his
negotiating team.

Among the Palestinian negotiating team were some who sought agreement,
compromise, and moderation. But their influence over Arafat was nil. The
negotiators that confronted us had no more than a virtual mandate. With
a few who will remain anonymous (in order that they not come to harm in
today's threatening atmosphere) it was definitely possible to reach a
reasonable agreement. But when it came time for a command decision
Arafat dismissed the achievements of his negotiators with the wave of a
hand. Even before Palestinian violence erupted, Arafat did not
consistently and clearly project a readiness to reach a true historic
compromise with Zionism, one based on the partition of the Land of
Israel into two independent political entities. And in the absence of
any other directive from above, the ongoing hostility and wild
incitement fell on fertile ground.

Thus the tactic employed by Arafat was based on the facade of a
political process, but in practice on a totally passive approach. Dennis
Ross, head of the American peace team, recently stated that at Camp
David, Arafat--unlike his designated negotiators--did not propose a
single negotiating idea throughout the 15 days (other than the claim
that the Temple Mount never existed in Jerusalem, but rather only in
Shechem [Nablus]). After the summit, according to Ross, intensive
negotiations resumed between the sides, with the participation of Ben
Ami and Sher, Erikat and Dahlan. Arafat's delegates told him that the
emerging ideas looked good, and he knew that the US was preparing to
present its own proposal based on these understandings at the end of
September. It was clear that a reasonable agreement was possible in the
foreseeable future.

Throughout this period Arafat sought the appropriate timing and excuse
to introduce an additional element into the arena: violence. Arafat,
Ross notes, did not lift a finger to prevent the encouragement and
outburst of terrorism and violence. Toward the end of December President
Clinton did indeed present his proposals, based on thousands of hours of
direct negotiations and his own best judgment as to what the parties
could accept. Arafat rejected them all, both practically and at the
official level. Deep down, according to the head of the American team,
Arafat could not end the conflict with Israel, because this would have
meant his own personal demise.

Thus from the end of September 2000 the dominant Palestinian strategy
sought to exercise pressure on Israel through terrorism and violence,
portray Palestinians in the eyes of the world as innocent victims, evade
any substantive political decision--yet maintain the appearance of
willingness to continue the political process. In parallel Arafat sought
to consolidate international legitimization and national unity in the
Palestinian camp, along with active Arab financial, material and
diplomatic support.

The disputed issues will not change, nor will the solutions. When the
time comes for the parties to end their terrible bloodletting, and when
a balanced and responsible Palestinian leadership emerges, the two sides
will agree on the formula for permanent status. It may be phased; it may
be preceded, as a means of ensuring the democratic Jewish existence of
the State of Israel, by Israeli-initiated separation. I assess that the
agreement will be very similar to the formula that emerged during the
period 1999-2001.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: From your experience, what have been the strong and
weak points in the negotiating process?

A: First of all, when you look at the negotiations on the Israeli
side, they are all dependent on who makes the understandings. The
Palestinians have not changed their strategy, but from the Israeli side,
we have seen many strategies.

From the beginning, when we prepared for the Oslo talks, we put the core
of our effort on ending the occupation over the territories of 1967 and
how to establish our national state with rights for refugees, according
to [United Nations Resolution] 194. I think that all the faults of the
Oslo agreement are very clear now. Its base is very clear--how to end
the occupation gradually. You will find that in the agreement itself,
the West Bank and Gaza Strip are one territorial unit. The base [of the
agreement] was that this is Palestinian territory, and that the talks
would put an end to the occupation. In the peace process negotiations,
we spoke about ""Gaza and Jericho first"" and we discussed an interim
agreement for the West Bank. In the West Bank, we set a gradual
redeployment with three phases after the first redeployment, and we
began this. It was after this that the Israelis began to challenge this
concept.

About Jerusalem, which was a difficult issue alongside the refugees, we
agreed that Jerusalem was to be part of these talks. Beyond that, we
discussed the Palestinians in Jerusalem, that they were a part of the
Palestinian people, and that they would participate in the Legislative
Council and in elections. We got that.

Q: Was there a basic strategy that you used?

A: Our strategy was to use the interim solution to continue towards
the final. This was the clearest point of our strategy. Towards that, we
got the Israelis to agree that the territories were based on [United
Nations Resolution] 242, meaning that historical Palestine would be
divided into two states--a Palestinian state of the West Bank and Gaza,
including East Jerusalem, and the Israeli state on the other part of
historical Palestine.

During this time, the Israelis started to focus on ""peace and security.""
We succeeded in some areas of security and we failed in others. In the
beginning, they [the Israeli side] changed some strategic elements and
the concepts of Oslo gradually. In the Gaza-Jericho agreement, they
asked about some issues that were new obstacles. It was a big mistake
for the Palestinian side to agreed to some of these elements, for
example, when they agreed that the international passages in Rafah and
Jericho would be considered military installation areas. This was then
used to put up many obstacles opposing the movement of Palestinians and
to concentrate on security, not political, concepts.

The other element that gave them new ways of concentrating the
occupation, rather than moving to end the occupation, was when a zone
was created around the settlements, especially in the Gaza settlements.
This zone was used not for security, but to expand settlement activities
and make Palestinian movement more difficult around this area.

Further, they used the three lateral roads to put new obstacles inside
Gaza itself. Later, we saw that practically the Israelis can cut Gaza in
three or four areas using the settlements, the roads and the beach of
the Gaza Strip.

Q: How did this affect the outcome of the talks?

A: The Israelis were not looking for peace, they wanted to use
security as a solution. This became more apparent when we came to the
interim agreement for the West Bank and they asked and succeeded in
changing the concept of the Declaration of Principles to divide the West
Bank into A, B, and C, the populated and unpopulated areas. This was the
first stone to break the [back of the] Oslo agreement and give the
Israelis the upper hand in controlling the agreement itself. In my mind,
it was a strategic mistake for the Palestinian side to agree. They then
became locked in a policy dependent on intentions. And we paid the price.

What has happened now is that they have used all of this against us,
especially when the Likud came to power. Maybe with the Labor Party, we
could have continued after this strategic mistake. But when you have the
Likud party, which is already against Oslo itself, this strategic
mistake was used against the Palestinians and against the peace process.
They put up obstacles and opened the road for settlement activities.

This was when Palestinians lost hope. It started with the coming of
Benjamin Netanyahu, and the changing of the concept of the relationship
itself. Instead of having peace, we had to protect what we had gotten.

Q: How can things progress?

A: At this time, with Sharon, I think it is very difficult, unless
the international community wants to close the file. In spite of all
that happened with [former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud] Barak and all of
his stupidity, at Taba we built for the future. We have the paper that
was published by Miguel Moratinos, the understandings of Taba that
outlined more than 90 percent of the issues and opened the road to
closing the file.

I think we are very close to closing it--and very far from closing it.
We have documents to close the file, but we don't have a partner to
close the file. Instead of using the paper to close the file, the
Israeli side is using tanks to close it. This strategy puts the people
under pressure. The Palestinian people want to protect themselves
against Israeli aggression and the Israelis feel that the Palestinian
intifada will continue. Despite what is on the paper, they don't even
look at it. As I told you, if there are no real international efforts,
we will live in the mentality of war.
"
"Isr","Neut","When 10-year-old Muhammad al Dura was shot and killed on camera in the
opening hours of the current conflict between Israel and the
Palestinians, Israel lost the information war. There was a child, a boy,
hugging his father on the back, hiding behind a barrel, ducking and
dodging as bullets whizzed between Israel and Palestinian positions,
only to be killed for all to see. It did not matter that a Palestinian
bullet may have been responsible. The image of Israel as a ruthless
aggressor and occupier, guilty of disproportionate use of force, was
cast forever.

So much was this the case that Ehud Barak, speaking at a conference at
Tel Aviv University two years later, related how as prime minister he
visited several countries in Europe, and almost all the heads of state
he met had Dura's picture framed in their offices, making normal
political and diplomatic discourse impossible.

Since then, Israel has been fighting a losing media battle, even when
the media should have been on its side, like during the horrific
lynching and decimation of three Israeli reservists who had strayed into
Ramallah by mistake early in the war, or the devastation caused by the
many suicide bombings that have rocked the country over the past three
years. While these images generated revulsion around the world, they did
not translate into empathy for Israel or its cause. Israel continued to
be seen as the aggressor, even though it had not initiated the conflict
in September 2000.

Despite the devastation of suicide bombings, Israel continued to be
perceived as Goliath and the Palestinians as victims. No matter how
repulsive suicide bombers who specifically go after civilian populations
may be, they did not negate the negative imagery of F-16s, helicopters,
tanks, artillery and bulldozers operating in populated areas, nor create
a sense of equivalency in the eyes of the international public.

The image problem for Israel was more than just a vanity issue. As the
war progressed, the harm to its international relations on all fronts,
other than the United States, was tangible. The media was also one of
the main avenues for the Palestinians to achieve their primary strategic
goal of internationalizing the conflict.

The information war, in consequence, took on an important strategic
dimension. The authorities responded in two ways: the military grasped
that it had to cooperate with the media on the understanding that if you
cannot cap the story, cooperate with those working on it to get your
point across. The new war crimes regime at the International Criminal
Court and its implications, coupled with the intrusive eye of the camera
in documenting the army's behavior, also had an impact on the army
modulating its behavior toward the media.

In government however, particularly the Prime Minister's Office and the
Government Press Office, it was decided to deal with the problem by
declaring the media an enemy of Israel. Danny Seaman, head of the GPO,
went as far as calling the foreign press contingent in Israel
""anti-Semitic."" His colleague, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's spokesman
to the foreign media, Raanan Gissen, has made the same assertion in
private and public. Instead of trying to win over the media, they went
to war against it, rallying the muscle of Israel's friends abroad to
pressure networks into being ""fair and balanced"". Well-meaning members
of the Jewish community established media watch organizations hoping to
stem the tide of criticism, while others hired spin doctors and media
experts to help the Israeli government make its case.

The Israel Defense Forces has had some success in changing its
relationship with the media, but government foreign media relations
remain tenuous, based on suspicion, not cooperation, as witnessed by
Seaman's recent failed attempt to regulate who holds a press card by
submitting the list of applicants to the General Security Service. And
despite all the investment, Israel's international image continues to
deteriorate to a point where, whether we like the poll or not, most
Europeans think Israel is the number one threat to world peace.

The truth is that you can hire all the spin doctors in the world, but
when you raze three seven-story apartment buildings to the ground in
Gaza in response to an attack on soldiers at Netzarim, or when wild
settlers are allowed to cut down 200 and more Palestinian olive trees
with impunity, with no attempt being made to find the perpetrators, you
will not get the media to tolerate you, let alone love you.

If Israel spent more time thinking about its policies than its
information problems, the country's image would improve remarkably.
Media should be taken into account before bulldozing houses and orchards
or building a security fence that--if allowed to go on as planned--will
imprison 140,000 Palestinians in four concentrated areas and cut them
off from their fields and, in many cases, from their families.

If Israel wants to win the information war it should stop shooting
itself in the foot, something it has done so consistently it is a wonder
the country can still limp along.
"
"Pal","Neut","Since other articles in this forum will present the Israeli perspective,
I will commit myself solely to the Palestinian perspective.

During the government of Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, a man
who always openly expressed his support for peace efforts as the way out
of this bloody conflict, a Palestinian-Israeli committee was formed to
deal with the issue of incitement. Notably, the Israeli government saw
it as a committee for handling /Palestinian/ incitement. In response, in
August Palestinians republished the 1997 presidential decree against
incitement, which was issued by President Arafat as one of his
obligations after talks with Benjamin Netanyahu's government at Wye
River Plantation.

Subsequently, I began to see how many Israeli journalists and foreign
correspondents in Israel and the Palestinian territories picked up on
the issue of ""incitement"" and began to move across the barriers erected
to separate the Palestinian and Israeli sides from each other in order
to cover the story. Many of these journalists asked me for my opinion on
the subject, but what caught my attention most was their reiterated
accusations that the Palestinian educational curriculum and media was
full of incitement.

While speaking to the correspondent of the /Wall Street Journal/, I
related to him that the Palestinian governmental television and radio
stations are those least watched and listened to, and are not at all
influential in forming Palestinian public opinion. I told him that,
according to public opinion polls, only five percent of Palestinians
watch government television, and that only ten percent of Palestinians
rely on its news reports, according to a survey carried out in October
2003. I also told him that all serious studies that have been done on
the Palestinian school curriculum demonstrate that it is free of any
text that might be considered incitement--that is, of course, if we
agree that incitement means pushing the audience to hate others for
their religion, ethnicity or opinions.

Still that correspondent continued his deluge of questions: ""But an
Israeli official asserted to me that a Palestinian math teacher in an
elementary school in a Palestinian village teaches his pupils
mathematics by using numbers of murdered Jews in questions of addition
and subtraction.""

I could not respond. Who can really give a negative or positive answer
in this case, when no one knows who collected that information, and in
which school and village it took place, or the name of the teacher? All
the same, this ""example"" was used by the Israelis to prove the presence
of Palestinian incitement in school curricula. It was evidence used by
an official. Notably, the story has no room for a narrative that states
that Israeli soldiers' humiliation of Palestinians has an impact and is
a source of ""incitement.""

Yesterday, Agence France Press Jerusalem bureau chief Christian Chaise
protested via letter an article published by David Bedein entitled
""Press Passes for Terrorists,"" which was published in
/FrontPageMagazine.com/ on November 13, 2003. The author wrote that
Palestinians seek to acquire press cards from the Israeli Government
Press Office in order to facilitate their alleged terrorist activities.
The author proffered the example of a stringer that he claimed worked
for AFP in Jenin and had been arrested by Israeli forces for being ""a
terrorist."" The writer used this to ""prove"" that Palestinians who work
for the foreign press in Israel are terrorists, or at least potential
terrorists.

The director of AFP in Jerusalem denied the story and challenged the
author to substantiate it. Consequently, David Bedein apologized in an
open letter to the Foreign Press Association in Israel, and said that he
had used sources in his article that proved unreliable.

But the damage was already done, and there was no notice placed on the
website that published the article indicating that the story was false.
The extent of the change made was for the author to strike the line that
accused the foreign press and Palestinian journalists of being
terrorists, and supporting terrorism. But this all stemmed from a purely
fabricated story about an alleged terrorist stringer!

So where then are the boundaries of incitement and political propaganda,
and when do public relations reach their limit?

I fear that the media has become a ""channel without a filter,"" that
passes ""messages"" which politicians, security people and the military
desire to send to the public, in this case, the Israeli public and world
public opinion. Both of these publics are targeted because--after
all--this competition is over who will win their favor.

The mechanism is very simple, particularly when the media does not
question official stories, especially those coming from the military.
When news stories are related to Palestinians, the principles of the
profession, which dictate checking the source from a variety of
perspectives, seem to vanish. These principles are ignored in favor of
other principles: ""national considerations in time of war.""

This holds true in the opposite direction, as well, but the Palestinian
and Israeli media experiences are vastly different. Each varies in
structure, history, and composition, and has a subsequently unique
impact. Israel's media is immeasurably more influential, however, and
when it errs, the consequences are graver and more dangerous.

I rarely find that anyone is interested in asking how this accumulation
of hatred latent in the philosophy of the official line in times of war
can be erased. Its impact on both the Palestinian and Israeli publics is
very serious, and it will be difficult to rid ourselves of this hatred
when the need for ""propaganda"" ends, and is replaced by public relations
experts committed to reestablishing the bridges of confidence that allow
for the minimum of coexistence between our two peoples.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: What is your general reaction to the French initiative?

A: I think it's very positive that the French and perhaps the
entire European Union are taking a peace initiative. So far, EU policy
regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been characterized by
communiques, condemnations and declarations. So a pragmatic approach is
most welcome. Europe needs to define a foreign policy personality,
especially now that the US is not engaging like previous
administrations. I also agree with the French idea of an international
mechanism for ensuring implementation.

Q: And the plan itself?

A: I have some very serious reservations. Of course, any plan that
works is welcome, but I see some major weaknesses in this one.

Q: Let's start with the idea of holding new Palestinian
elections.

A: The elections are supposed to be about a vote of confidence for
the peace process. But when Palestinians don't see the final outline of
an agreement on refugees, Jerusalem and borders--one of the problems
with the entire Oslo process--why should a majority of them legitimize
the process and the Palestinian Authority through their vote? Further,
the institutions of the PA did not inspire the confidence of the masses;
if the process is in a shambles, so is the PA, which is an invention of
the peace process. The elections are presented here as a way of
re-legitimizing the institutions of the PA; in other words, you're
acknowledging that they are no longer legitimate. People won't
legitimize them without assurances regarding the outcome of the process.
Elections need to crown a process, not start a process.

Q: You think Fateh might lose the elections?

A: It's highly probable that Fateh would lose to Hamas, the Tanzim
and other grass roots organizations that run the uprising. I wonder
whether Arafat would accept such a plan.

Q: Let's turn to the second key component of the initiative:
the declaration of a Palestinian state as a starting point for
negotiations.

A: From my modest experience, Palestinians don't see the
declaration of a state within the context of an agreement with Israel,
but as their natural right, regardless of whether there's a process.
When we were negotiating the FAPS [the Framework Agreement on Permanent
Status, the focus of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during Barak's
tenure] the Palestinians always wanted to keep the declaration of a
state out of the agreement. After this intifada, if anything this
attitude will be strengthened. Statehood could be included only if we
have full agreement and it remains merely to carry it out in installments.

Q: The French initiative to reverse the order is intended as
a kind of political jolt, to break the cycle of violence and reintroduce
political concepts. Does that make sense?

A: Not really. The only element that will change things is if the
Palestinian population sees its main needs agreed upon. The Palestinians
are deeply disappointed with the fantasies of this peace process. Just
because you tell them ""now you have a state"", they won't take it
seriously. The grass roots organizations that control the street will
not be very friendly to the idea.

Q: The French initiative calls for Israel to carry out a
third further redeployment (FRD) almost immediately.

A: If the government of Israel could agree in principle to the
Clinton parameters, then there would be a basis for a third FRD of
serious proportions. But this is not the case.

Q: Do you see parallels between the French plan and the
Peres-Abu Alaa plan?

A: To this day I don't know if there is such an agreement
[Peres-Abu Alaa]. I met recently with Abu Alaa and Muhammad Rashid and I
don't recall Abu Alaa saying there is a binding convergence. At least
one of them wants to set up some sort of talks with the Labor Party.
Why, if there is a Peres-Abu Alaa plan? In fact, neither is a real plan.
Neither offers details of the attributes of a Palestinian state:
sovereignty, territory, control.

Q: Suppose one of these plans were to be implemented...

A: The Sharon government will survive another year or so, then
probably be followed by a right or right of center government. Now
assume the French plan is carried out, or even that Sharon's own
proposals [for an interim Palestinian state] are accepted, and this or
the next Israeli government negotiates the attributes of a state and
doesn't reach agreement. Will the PA behave like Syria when it
negotiated, failed to get back the Golan, and then did nothing?

These plans repeat a major fallacy of Oslo--and I say this as a friend
of the Oslo process. The framers of Oslo assumed that the creation of
the PA would turn the Palestinian national movement into a quasi-state
that would negotiate its border conflict with Israel to reach a
compromise between two civilized political entities. If there is no
agreement, nothing bad will happen and they will continue to negotiate.
This concept proved to be fallacious. When the Palestinians failed to
achieve their objectives in negotiations, they again became a liberation
movement. Thus our conflict cannot be a border dispute like that between
Israel and Syria merely because the Palestinians declare a state.
"
"Pal","Neut","An active role by France and other powers that maintain a measure of
objectivity vis-a-vis the Palestinian Israeli conflict is welcome and
indeed essential for reviving the peace process. (That is not to say
that the position of the United States does not remain very important,
despite frustrations with its hopelessly biased and blindly pro-Israel
policy. The chances of any initiative's success would be immensely
improved if it gets US support.) Therefore, the French initiative is an
interesting development that should be analyzed carefully and its
content, context and timing properly understood. I will first take issue
with the content.

The first objective of the proposed elections is to support the
""popular"" legitimacy of the Palestinian National Authority--unfairly
putting a question mark on that legitimacy--in order to enable it to
crack down on the ""extremists."" This places the onus of responsibility
in the present confrontation on the Palestinians and disregards the fact
that successive Israeli governments have not only not cracked down on
Israeli extremists, i.e. the settlers, but encouraged them and afforded
them protection.

The second objective is to confirm that a large Palestinian majority
indeed subscribes to the principles underlying the peace process. This
disregards the fact that the present Palestinian authority was elected
on a peace platform. It also disregards the fact that the present
Israeli government and its prime minister, who is a confessed opponent
of ""the principles underlying the peace process,"" has been elected with
the largest majority of Israeli popular vote in any Israeli elections
since 1967.

The third objective, that of re-instilling in Israelis the feeling that
the ""other camp"" is largely in favor of peace, disregards the fact that
the Palestinians are the side that need to be reassured of the peaceful
intentions of the other camp. It is a fact that there are members in the
present Israeli government who are outspoken advocates of transfer, i.e.
eviction of Palestinians from their ancestral homeland.

If this non-paper is intended for both sides, then the facts tell that
it is the Israeli side that should be called upon to hold elections in
the hope of achieving this proposal's stated objectives. After all, is
it not a fact that the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) leads the
Palestinian peace camp?

In summary, the objectives stated in support of elections are not
convincing. I very much doubt that their authors missed the obvious
points made above.

As for declaring a state as a way of ending the Intifada, this would be
an exercise in self-deceit, as a state under occupation changes nothing
in the present situation. At best, it would take us back to September
2000, when such a declaration was contemplated and set aside for
well-known reasons. Renewal of Palestinian society's commitment to
building a state is a worthy objective. While we should accept
responsibility for many of our failures and shortcomings, it remains a
fact that Israel, by constantly undermining the prospects for peace and
stability through settlement activity and by dragging its feet on
interim agreements, has been destroying everything built by the PNA
since Oslo, including economic and security institutions.

It should be obvious now that an independent, sovereign and viable
Palestinian state can only come as a result of an expression of the
Palestinian right to self-determination after the end of occupation, and
not as a result of an agreement with Israel while occupation continues.

The problem that I have with the French non-paper is that it has
drawbacks that are too obvious to have been overlooked by its authors. I
am inclined to think that France and other European countries are only
trying to flesh out the so-called Peres-Abu Ala' non-paper, which
explains the timing. The French non-paper does that in probably the only
way in which the Israelis and Americans will not object.

If so, a reminder is in order: the present Intifada has focused all
Palestinian thinking on the objective of ending occupation. The
initiative has to go much further and probably take a different
direction. The root cause of the conflict is not the Intifada or
inadequate governance, but occupation. There are ambiguities in the
so-called Peres-Abu Ala' non-paper that could be addressed and side
issues that could be put in their proper context. Instead of doing that,
the French initiative seems to make elections a prerequisite for the
implementation of the Mitchell recommendations. Without derogating from
the merits of elections if held in the right time and under the proper
conditions, the Palestinian side is not the one that needs now a change
in heart or in leadership. The Israeli side does!
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: What does the Israeli government led by Ariel Sharon
expect from this round of the Zinni mission?

A: It takes only one to make war, but two to make peace. So I'll
avoid jumping into quantitative analyses about the coming days. From
Israel's perspective, we welcome the mission. To that end, we have moved
forces out of Ramallah and most parts of area A that were occupied
during the terrorist wave of the last two weeks. We are willing to leave
the remaining sensitive areas provided the Palestinians take
responsibility. The process must be reciprocal. We want to resume high
level security talks, achieve a ceasefire and implement the Tenet work
plan.

Q: Prime Minister Sharon greeted the initiative to return
Zinni to the region by foregoing his demand for seven full days of
complete quiet. Why?

A: The rationale for the seven days was to create a dynamic of
quiet to give Tenet a chance to succeed. However, in view of the extent
of the latest wave of terrorism it wasn't realistic to achieve seven
days. So we decided to give up this stipulation and, hopefully, begin
negotiating Tenet. We went the extra mile. But it has to be clear that
if terrorism continues or resumes, we will respond and exercise our
right to self-defense.

Q: The government has agreed to establish a high level
""diplomatic"" committee to parallel the security committee. Foreign
Minister Peres is a member. Does this in fact constitute the
introduction of a political element into discussions, and if so, isn't
this a departure from PM Sharon's position until now?

A: The official name of this committee is the Senior Committee. Its
objective is to assist with the talks that take place in the high level
trilateral security committee. Only when security talks have succeeded
can the Senior Committee get into the Mitchell framework and beyond.
Meanwhile it could discuss living conditions, economics and the like.
But we will maintain the principle of no political dialogue under fire.

Q: Are you saying that if tomorrow there is a total
ceasefire, the government will be prepared to discuss political issues
immediately?

A: One lesson we have learned from the past 7 to 8 years'
experience is that both sides must abide by the letter and the principle
of their agreements. Tenet and Mitchell are agreed and must be followed.
We have however introduced one modification: we will judge their
implementation by performance rather than maintaining rigid timetables.

Q: If Zinni succeeds, Sharon's unity government will soon
find itself confronting the first political step of the renewed process:
a freeze on settlement construction. Can it agree to this?

A: The government's official guidelines speak of no new settlements
and a political solution based on [United Nations resolutions] 242, 338.
When we get to the first political bridge of the Mitchell formula, I'm
sure we can cross it. But right now there is no point even in discussing
it in the unity government, which embodies two different ideological
directions.

Q: There has been speculation that Zinni might be bringing
with him a tougher mandate and enhanced authority this time. Do you
think anything has changed in his terms of reference?

A: No, not to my knowledge. My impression so far is that it is the
same mission: implement Tenet, then get to Mitchell.

Q: There was also talk that Zinni would arrive together with
ceasefire monitors, or that they would arrive in the near future.

A: We were never approached on this at all. Monitors may be
appropriate for later stages, but there is no point introducing them
before there is concrete and complete understanding on the ground. After
all, there are acts of terrorism that no monitors can prevent. When we
get to this issue, in accordance with Mitchell, it will require the full
consent of both parties, coupled with clear terms of reference.

Q: How do you assess the commitment of the United States
administration to work for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process beyond
Tenet and Mitchell?

A: I would not presume to speak for the US administration. We have
a common interest in stabilizing the Middle East and achieving a genuine
peace that provides security and prosperity to all. In that regard we
welcome the American contribution, which may vary in scope according to
circumstances.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What is your message to United States envoy Anthony
Zinni?

A: First of all, we believe that this American administration
has not played a fair and honest role in the Middle East. It bears the
responsibility of what has occurred over the last 18 months.

As such, our message for General Zinni is that if he is coming to make
real peace, he should address the Israelis and ask them to stop their
aggressive attacks against our people and to end the Israeli military
occupation.

If General Zinni is trying to achieve security, on the other hand, I
think he will not achieve anything. He should change his way of
directing the negotiations and offer the Palestinians a political
solution. There will never be any kind of security solution if there is
not a political solution. The Palestinians will not accept any kind of
solution that does not guarantee the end of the Israeli occupation and a
full Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders.

Q: Have you heard some of the things that General Zinni
is discussing?

A: I think he is trying to achieve a ceasefire, but in our
experience, the ceasefire will not last for a long time. Any attempt to
reach a ceasefire that disregards political agreements will not succeed.
I hope that General Zinni will understand that if there is a political
solution that leads to the end of the Israeli military occupation within
the 1967 borders, it will succeed and be welcomed by the Palestinian
people.

Q: Can you give an example of the kind of agreement that
would be acceptable to you?

A: A political solution leading to the end of the Israeli
military occupation. This is what the Palestinians are fighting for.

Q: Could that happen in stages?

A: It should be according to a short timetable for full Israeli
withdrawal. If the Israelis do that, in line with the Americans and the
international community, I believe that after the end of the occupation,
we could start real negotiations on the other issues.

Q: How do you expect the Israeli government to react to
Zinni's visit?

A: I think that the Israeli government is trying to destroy the
Zinni mission, as it did with the last two missions. To do that, it
increases its assassination policies and aggressive policies in general.
I don't think that it is interested in peace in this region. This
terrorist government in Tel Aviv is interested in continuing the
aggression against our people. I don't think that there is any chance
for any kind of agreement with this kind of government.

Q: What should Zinni do then to keep the Israelis from
sabotaging progress?

A: First of all, I think he should ask the Israelis to stop
their aggression, to stop the assassination policy, to lift the closure
and also to offer a timetable for full Israeli withdrawal from the
occupied territories. Otherwise, I do not think he will achieve
anything. He will not succeed.

Q: When will Palestinian operations stop?

A: When the Israelis end their military occupation of our
land.
"
"Isr","Neut","From the political point of view, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
was jump-started with the signing of the Oslo Accords
                  . A famous handshake between two enemies raised hopes
for a peaceful future, close at hand. Since then, it has become clear
that such diplomatic efforts alone are insufficient to bring peace to
the Israeli and Palestinian communities who have been adversaries for so
many years.

Political leaders may attempt, and occasionally succeed, to conclude
agreements about borders, water and security, but their efforts, vital
as they may be, are conducted in the rarefied atmosphere of high level
international diplomacy. They do not directly advance reconciliation
between peoples. In order to create a just and stable peace between
Israelis and Palestinians, individuals, communities and civil
institutions must join hands with the diplomats to facilitate deep
changes in attitudes. The way to do this is to design, implement and
participate in creative joint activities that challenge existing
stereotypes.

Even the most honest, good faith implementation of political agreements
cannot repair the chiasmic psychological, emotional and educational
fault lines opened after years of conflict. If left unattended, these
""black holes"" can swallow up years of hard diplomatic effort. Our
painful experience has taught us that we have no choice but to recognize
the educational system as playing a strategic role in the political
process. This is important for two reasons.

First, the education systems can only be used as a means for
dissemination of peace if their legitimacy as shapers of attitudes is
restored and recognized by political leaders. Addressing these issues on
the strategic level shows to the peoples on both sides that ultimately
it is their commitment to peace and reconciliation that will assure the
outcome of the political process. If the political leaders fail to
recognize the role of the educational institutions in the process and in
future stability, how can we expect the next generation to put its faith
in that same system? Already we witness the strong negative effects of
the mass media, as the issue of incitement is raised as a tool for each
side to de-legitimize the other. If we do not recognize educational
institutions as vehicles to create and affect society, we leave a vacuum
for others, proponents of hate and conflict, to fill.

Secondly, in trying to create stability in a region so wounded and
affected by violence and war, the educational institutions must be seen
as central partners in the rehabilitative process. One of the
fundamental building blocks of a stable reality is an educational system
that enhances the capacities, values and responsibilities of citizens.
This is not a question of how a child learns to perceive his or her
former enemy, but rather a larger question of how a child becomes
capable and confident to provide for his or her future. Peace and
security cannot be guaranteed by security measures alone which, as
necessary as they are, can often antagonize and divide. Such security
measures will serve their purpose if they are enforced in the context of
a civil society, which can exist and flourish only if supported by an
effective and exciting educational system. Thus, politicians and
diplomats will find their efforts frustrated if they do not work
strategically to assure an accommodating educational environment.

What do we mean when we speak of education on the strategic level?
Clearly this does not imply that the political negotiators should begin
to design textbooks or argue over relevant curricula. It also does not
mean that mere lip service should be paid to the need for including
values of understanding and peace within the educational curricula.
These are issues that need to be developed on the professional level,
much as any other strategic area of the negotiations. Creating a
strategic place for the educational systems would mean that just as the
negotiators on all levels consult military experts, economic experts,
diplomatic experts and sometimes health and media experts as well, so
too an educational track should be consulted. Once this is recognized,
then there is a legitimate role for education in implementation, too. A
negotiating and follow-up educational committee should be created
alongside all other such committees.

The content of the educational component of a peace agreement would need
to address the following issues:

    1. How to ensure that schools will be accessible and safe
    environments for all children ages 3-18;

    2. How to provide adequate support (including compensation) for
    teachers to contend with (a) the dynamic changes in the reality, and
    (b) the suffering and trauma of themselves and their students;

    3. How to address issues of a core unified curriculum; to what
    extent is such a curriculum advisable in creating a stable,
    confident and open-minded society;

    4. How to address the role of communications (mainly TV, radio and
    internet) as competitors (with a negative impact) to the formal
    educational systems;

    5. What should be the role of the educational systems in reaching
    out to the communities (mainly parents and informal education);

    6. What shall be the criteria for renewing textbooks; who is in
    charge of monitoring them, and at what frequency?

Any peace process, even if just at the stage of a ceasefire, must
recognize the role of those who stand at the forefront of society day in
and day out--the educators. The questions outlined above require
strategic discussion, as well as policy decisions. These cannot be taken
only at the grassroots level. If we demand of the educational system to
work for the implementation of a peace agreement, including a
detoxification of society from hate and animosity and an enhancing of
skills for non-violent conflict resolution, it is necessary to provide
the leaders of that system with the mandate to do so.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: Over the last twenty years, have you noticed any
fundamental changes in how Palestinians educate their children?

A: The effect of the occupation has been disastrous. Early on, the
whole system was under the supervision of the [Israeli] occupation
authorities, the civil administration. It intervened in the curriculum;
under security pretenses it closed schools and arrested students.

With the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, nothing dramatic
has changed except that the Authority has the entire thing in its hands,
and has tried to revise the curriculum and build new schools. We noticed
some positive changes in the transition period after the Oslo accords
                  .

But with the second intifada and reoccupation, all that was built in the
Oslo period [was destroyed]. There were dire effects due to the closure
and there was the psychological effect on students of the destruction of
homes.

Now with the resumption of peace negotiations--perhaps more than after
the signing of Oslo--there is a continuing Israeli effort to intervene
in the Palestinian curriculum under certain pretexts: to prevent
""incitement"" and so-called ""propaganda"" against the Israelis. The
Palestinian Authority has been under pressure to comply with Israeli and
American demands concerning the Palestinian curriculum, but so far, it
has succeeded partially in resisting such intervention.

Q: Why would Palestinians resist that pressure? The concept
of ""peace education"" sounds quite innocuous and even desirable.

A: When you look at peace from the Israeli point of view, it is not
only to have the land and the geography, but also to have sovereignty
over Palestinian culture and education and history.

Even if we sign a peace agreement, we cannot sign peace agreements in a
vacuum. Aside from our history and our past, Palestine is part of our
selves, our culture, our education. If I reach a political peace with
the Israelis, that doesn't mean that you disinherit me. That doesn't
mean that you occupy my memory or that you erase my memory. That is what
Israelis want: to erase the personal and collective Palestinian memory.

This is impossible. Even if we /wanted/ to succumb to Israeli pressure,
it is impossible to make a Palestinian teach his child that Jaffa or
Haifa or Palestine before 1948 was not his land. On a practical level, I
would say that most Palestinians want peace. They want peace with
equality and relative justice. But you cannot impose on any people that
they forget their culture.

Q: Are you saying that political agreements need to come
before social reconciliation?

A: I am saying that we must be able to differentiate between a
political peace and cultural reconciliation. If the Israelis sincerely
want peace, then we must work for cultural reconciliation first.
Cultural reconciliation must not be imposed only on Palestinians, it
should be bipartisan. All the political agreements between Palestinians
and Israelis have failed because the Israelis have not come to recognize
that reconciliation should take precedence. Israelis want to impose
their political will over Palestinians, while at the same time imposing
their view of the reconciliation.

They don't even use the word ""reconciliation"". When we are talking about
""reconciliation"", we are talking about two parties on equal footing, two
parties respecting each other's cultures, two parties recognizing each
other's suffering and two parties recognizing each other's history. But
we are facing a party that has the power and that party wants
Palestinians to forget their history and to give hegemony to the Israeli
perspective of Palestine.

That will not happen. Even if we are politically weak, and even if there
are political agreements imposed on the Palestinians, real
reconciliation will not take place if there is no mutual recognition of
the suffering of two peoples.

Q: How serious is this battleground?

A: As I see it, the Palestinian Authority and those who are
supervising the educational system are not doing enough to resist those
pressures. Let's be frank. I know that these issues are being raised in
almost every political meeting. In every education circle out there, the
Israelis are using this issue as propaganda against Palestinians under
the mantle of so-called ""terrorism"". They say that Palestinians should
change their curriculum in order to fit the peace that they are
promising them.

But [Palestinian officials] are not arguing in these international
forums in order to expose Israeli pressure and to defend their point of
view. This has not been taken very seriously by the Palestinians. We
satisfy ourselves by saying, ""No, you cannot impose that,"" but in the
international arena, we have not done enough.
"
"Isr","Neut","As Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon approaches the first anniversary
of his initiative to unilaterally withdraw settlers and forces from the
Gaza Strip and northern West Bank, his plan faces formidable political
and security challenges that cast growing doubt on its eventual
implementation.

When the Knesset returned to session last week Sharon entered
parliamentary trench warfare, facing two legislative tasks: gaining
approval for his disengagement plan, and passing the 2005 budget bill.
He failed his first, albeit largely symbolic, test as the Knesset voted
to reject his statement combining the two controversial issues.

This unexpected failure led many analysts to wonder if Sharon, the
former political wizard, has grown weary and lost his magic. After all,
he has lost every political trial since unveiling his plan. In May, the
Likud members' referendum rejected it. In June, Sharon had to amend the
details and delay the actual decision on settlement removal in order to
get Cabinet approval. Then in August his party convention blocked the
entrance of the Labor party to the coalition, a necessary step for
widening the plan's support base.

In the current chaotic state of Israel's political system--a byproduct
of the withdrawal design--Sharon rules over a minority government,
backed by 58 or 59 out of 120 Knesset members, and must form an ad-hoc
coalition for every legislative move. His strategy has been ""divide and
conquer"": leaning on the left wing opposition to pass the disengagement
resolutions (both the plan's endorsement in principle, and a settler
evacuation-compensation bill), then turning right for the budget process.

By sheer head counting, Sharon is expected to win the disengagement
votes easily. His problem, however, lies within his party, where the
anti-withdrawal ""rebels"" form an effective block of 15 out of 40 MKs.
Alongside them, senior figures like ministers Binyamin Netanyahu, Sylvan
Shalom and Limor Livnat are torn between their loyalty to Sharon and
their need to please the Likud's central committee, which determines the
party's candidate list. The troika formally supports Sharon's plan,
while trying to dilute it through compromise. Recently, the three joined
the settler opposition's call for holding an unprecedented national
referendum over the plan.

Israeli law demands a referendum before giving away ""sovereign areas""
(i.e., the Golan or East Jerusalem), but not over occupied territories
like Gaza. The settlers--backed by threats of violent protest and
rabbinic appeals for massive refusal on the part of religious soldiers
to obey orders to carry out the evacuation--now call upon Sharon to ""ask
the public"". The prime minister hesitates, citing the inevitable delay
in implementation, and probably fearing another defeat by the
better-organized opposition. But pressure is mounting, and there are
hints he may rethink his position.

Sharon has clearly underestimated the intra-Likud resistance to his
idea. In this regard, in the past year an Israeli political myth--the
image of the ruling party's apparatus as a crowd of cynical
benefit-seekers--was proven wrong. As it happened the Likudniks appeared
as a strongly ideological group, opposing any land concessions as
""rewarding Palestinian terrorism"".

Terrorism is Sharon's second, no less complicated problem. In recent
weeks, the Gaza front erupted in violent escalation. Palestinian Qassam
rockets that killed two toddlers in the Israeli town of Sderot generated
in response a fierce, 17-day-long IDF operation in northern Gaza, in
which 129 Palestinians were killed--among them at least 42 civilians--at
the cost of the lives of three Israelis. When it ended, Israeli forces
left the Palestinian towns and redeployed in a ""security zone"" outside
them.

The violent events exposed the inherent paradox in Sharon's plan: in
order to get out of the despised Gaza region, Israel is getting deeper
into it. The unilateral idea of leaving a ""security vacuum"" on the other
side, without a credible authority to assure security and quiet,
threatens to turn disengagement into a bloody mess, with Hamas and
others trying to hit at the departing Israelis. Keeping a ""security
zone"" in post-withdrawal Gaza, no matter how narrow, is a recipe for
ongoing violence, undermining Israel's claim to ""end the occupation"".

Sharon knows this all too well, and repeatedly says he ordered the IDF
to ""prevent withdrawal under fire"". It is still unclear, however, how
this task can be achieved without coordination with a Palestinian
interlocutor. But given the precedence of the political test, the
security challenges will be dealt with later.

Sharon scheduled the disengagement votes to conclude before the American
presidential election, and plans a US trip in mid-November. The United
States is expected to show more involvement after the election no matter
who wins, and Sharon will be asked to deliver on his still unfulfilled
pledges to remove illegal West Bank outposts and freeze settlement
construction. Winning the disengagement votes with a credible majority
would probably give him more room to maneuver vis-a-vis the Americans
and the increasingly impatient Europeans. Therefore his domestic battle
is also a diplomatic one.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What is your reaction to {Israeli Prime Ministerial
advisor Dov] Weissglas' comments last week that Sharon's Gaza withdrawal
plan effectively aims to freeze the political process?

A: The position of Israel is very clear and needs little
explanation. Israel remains committed to its initial position that it
has claims to Palestine in general, not specifying any particular area.
Israel works for the implementation of this position. It never formally
recognized any rights for the Palestinians and that explains the conduct
of Israel.

Q: You don't believe Israel is in any way interested in a
Palestinian state?

A: No. I believe very strongly Israel is against the
establishment of a Palestinian state. The declared Palestinian position,
which is very moderate and very conciliatory, that we accept a state in
less than one-fourth of Palestine on the borders of 1967, is rejected by
Israel, and Israel has taken measures to make this impossible.

Q: What do you make of the international community's
position in this respect, accepting a two-state solution but also
Sharon's unilateral plans. Is this contradictory?

A: Yes, it is contradictory, but it is partly because our
performance in support of our own cause is not very well organized and
that may explain why the international community, in my opinion, does
not seem very aware of the issues. We have a definite failure as
Palestinians to extend our views and explain the situation properly so
that everybody can see the reality of the Israeli position.

Q: Do you see any political opportunities for Palestinians
if and when this unilateral withdrawal takes place.

A: The Palestinian performance is not organized, and there
is plenty of room for improvement on how we go about responding. But I
think the Israeli position is very clear, and it is clear what they want
to give and what they do not want to give. Our declared position, a
state within 1967 borders, is still not accepted by Israel. Zionism has
never been interested in Gaza. Israel remains committed to the claims of
the First Zionist Congress. The Gaza issue was not addressed during that
congress. It was obvious right from the beginning that they had no real
interest in Gaza, and I believe they sincerely want to withdraw from
Gaza. Equally certainly they want to exact a price for this, as far as
Palestinian rights in the rest of Palestine go.

Q: There seems to be a dynamic, ahead of any withdrawal, of
escalation, with Hamas declaring they will throw out Israel and Israel
declaring they will not withdraw under fire. Is this a sustainable dynamic?

A: No, it's not. As long as we go about our affairs without
the minimum level of organization we can't get anywhere. Our problem is
that we act without organization. This explains the disarray we suffer
from.

First of all we must realize national unity. We cannot leave the stage
open for every faction to do as it wishes as the situation is now. There
are many points of view and many different strategies on this and that
is the cause of our continuing disarray. What we need is that all
political factions join in one body that we call for instance the
national unity authority or leadership, where they air their views in
detail and then reach decisions democratically to which everybody is
committed. That's what we badly need.

No faction has the right to stay aside and act as it wishes. We are
badly in need of national unity to meet the present challenges. If we do
not do this, I am afraid that we shall remain in disarray.
"
"Isr","Neut","I. In the name of Allah the merciful and most compassionate, one of
whose holy names is ""peace"".

I would like to propose an idea whose essence is that peace between
Islam and Judaism should be an event of great religious significance.

We Jews can find in the holy scriptures of our Torah and in the words of
our prophets and sages two teachings; the first is that we should be
loyal unto death to the Torah that was given to us by Allah, hallowed be
his name, and to the community of the children of Israel. It is known
that we do not work to spread our religion to other peoples; moreover,
if a person who belongs to another congregation approaches and asks to
join the Jewish community, then the laws of our religion instruct us
first and foremost to address him and ask him not to do so and make the
conversion to the Jewish religion as difficult as possible.

The second is that we have a great dream in which all mankind worships
Allah the one and the eternal, worships and exalts him in our hearts and
consciences. How can we reach the realization of this universal dream?

In practice, in our world today it is possible to project a solution in
which Islam is the religion that spreads the message of belief in one
G-d to the whole world. According to the perception of our sages
throughout the years, the Muslims believe truthfully in one G-d.
Therefore, we can project an act in which Jews all over the world
support the spreading of the message of belief in one G-d by the Muslims.

From this point of view, how horrifying appears the Islamic-Jewish
conflict! It appears as one of the works of Satan, who wants to stop the
spread of the message of the belief in one G-d and prevent it from
reaching mankind worldwide. The continuation of this conflict between
the two religions, in particular the terrorist attacks against Jews that
were perpetrated in our holy land in the name of Islam, strengthen the
prejudices against Islam in the world. It is as if the scenes broadcast
by television to the entire world showing the victims, women and
children, and the spilled blood of innocents, are the images that
represent the religion of Islam as a whole.

We have to ""stone""--using modern measures that are permissible from
religious and moral points of view--the cursed Satan that is threatening
us all here in the holy land.

In addition, from the purely political point of view, it is impossible
to avoid these scenes of hatred between people and to achieve lasting
peace between Jews and Muslims without ensuring the participation of men
of religion, Muslims and Jews, in reaching that goal, especially in
light of the fact that Jewish and Muslim men of religion are ordered to
do so not for political reasons alone, but for religious reasons, and
they should exert every possible effort to strengthen the message of
belief in one G-d and to enhance his holy and sacred message in the
hearts of all mankind.

We have to accomplish a great deal in this field, and first and foremost
to think what the sacred religious precepts could do in our world today.
What is the modern significance of the message of the belief in one G-d?
How can we spread the message of one G-d in today's spiritual and
technological world? How can we translate the precepts of religion into
modern language, for example the concept of ""ahl a-d'imma"" (non-Muslim
residents of the Islamic state who enjoy its protection) in Islam, and
the concept of ""Jerusalem the source of the message of belief in one
G-d"" in Judaism.

II. In the name of Allah the merciful and most compassionate, one of
whose holy names is ""peace"".

We who received from G-d, blessed be he, responsibility for the Muslim
religious community and for the Jewish religious community that reside
here in the holy land, hereby declare in Jerusalem the holy city that
believers of the Israeli people and believers of the Palestinian people
should be the vanguard working for peace in this land, the land of peace.

The bloody war between Israelis and Palestinians is the work of Satan,
intended to humiliate the honor of believers worldwide. Hence we must
stone Satan, disobey his word and act with all our influence to put an
end to the bloodshed, which dishonors us and the holy land.

Hence we hereby declare our intention to establish a joint committee of
sheikhs and rabbis whose permanent seat is in Jerusalem the holy city,
capital of peace. The committee will make every effort on behalf of a
just solution to all disputes between Israelis and Palestinians, and the
creation of an atmosphere of peace among all believers. We call upon the
religious leaders of Jordan and all neighboring countries and the world
to join us in an effort to bring peace to the holy land, the land of peace.

And we pray with all our hearts that G-d, blessed and exalted be he,

"Pal","Neut","The Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Middle East is purely political.
Sadly, there is no other political conflict where the Torah, the Bible
and the Koran have been so utterly abused to justify injustice.

Some say we must take God out of the Middle East conflict, but I believe
God is the One to solve the conflict. The God I know is the source of
love. As a Christian, I believe that God in Jesus Christ sacrificed
himself to die on the cross and to rise again, bringing reconciliation
and wholeness to the world. The God I know certainly does not cause
tragedies, oppression or injustice but weeps with people in their pain
and calls them to act with justice, compassion and love.

In the Israeli and Palestinian conflict, religious people are divided
into two camps:

One group understands the Holy Writings in a literal fashion, using them
to justify ownership of all the land, the Israeli military occupation
and the building of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
There certainly are passages in the Old Testament and other Holy
Writings that will justify political atrocity if they are taken out of
their context and misinterpreted. The danger with this thinking is that
people make God the fighter for partisan human causes, even turning God
into a real estate broker. God then becomes part of the problem.
Forgotten is the essence of God, which is equal love and care for every
race and ethnicity, for people on both sides of the divide.

The other group sees the reality of politics but seeks from the Holy
Writings the ways in which justice, peace and reconciliation can be
accomplished, how religion can positively contribute to the solution of
the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. I believe God calls us to find the
positive values in Judaism, Christianity and Islam where there are more
than enough teachings to build a culture of peace rather than a culture
of war, violence, counter-violence and hatred.

I am sorry to see extremist mentalities and ideologies in all three
religions only adding fuel to the fire of conflict. For us, as
Palestinian Christians, the extremist Christian right ideologies are
imported, not local. They are alien to us and harm us. It is the duty of
religious and political people to combat every kind of religious
extremism, rejecting the idea of God as a ruthless general without
mercy. The God of Jews, Christians and Muslims is a God who wants
justice and only justice for all people.

To resolve the conflict I believe we need to move in two directions:

First, the two-state solution for Israel and Palestine needs to be
implemented. The current Israeli occupation of Palestinian people and
land must end. Occupation is a sin against God and against humanity
because it is destructive for both the occupier and the occupied. God
wants people to live in dignity, with their full human, religious and
political rights.

Secondly, God calls people in all three religions to be prophetic, not
only condemning injustice, but caring for the humanity of all people. He
calls on all of us not only to see God in ourselves, but in those
considered the enemy. Only when the otherness of the other is recognized
and people are given their God-given rights will the Holy Land become a
promised land of milk and honey for both Israelis and
Palestinians.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: Do you take Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei (Abu
Ala) seriously?

A: I take him seriously, [in the sense that] he listens to
the internal Israeli demands regarding demography, and he's using them.
He's not saying that he will demand [a one state solution]; he's still
committed to the two state solution.

Q: Why Abu Ala?

A: I can't second-guess him. I think he's part of the debate,
part of the discourse that I'm also involved in. He understands that if
there's no progress then the condition of binationalism, which already
exists, will become even more established. The situation now is
binational, [it involves] not only [Israeli] occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza. Beyond military occupation, this is a process that began 25 to
30 years ago and now resembles a quasi-permanent domination of the area
and a recreation of mandatory Palestine as one single geopolitical
entity. Therefore what Abu Ala appears to be saying is, we're talking
not about a wish but a fact. You don't want it, but this is the way you
realistically define the situation. Very soon it will be clear to all
that this is what has happened.

Q: Is a viable two state solution no longer feasible?

A: We have a problem of definition. What two states? Viable
solution, or viable states? This needs a lot of clarification. By now
the chances for two completely separate sovereign states, say resembling
Israel and Jordan, are impossible. To make that surgical partition and
create boundaries that leave both states independent and sovereign in
all respects is impossible.

Q: What about the two state solution now advocated by
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon?

A: A Palestinian state limited to less than half of the West
Bank and two thirds of Gaza is acceptable to Sharon. A two state
solution based on a willingness to divide the land equitably has now
been turned into a slogan of Sharon and company, the Israeli right, that
creates a system of domination that resembles a bantustan. So the two
state debate today has a totally different twist.

Q: Is a single state solution good for Israelis?

A: A single state can be a model for soft partition, as
opposed to a surgical partition with finite borders that separates two
distinct political entities. You can come up with a model of power
sharing on the federal level and sharing the territory. The boundaries
of the provinces will be softer than the rigid borders of two political
entities and this can resolve some of the problems that surgical
partition exacerbates.

Q: How would a federal system work?

A: It doesn't divide Israel from the West Bank only, but it
should deal with [territory] west of the green line as well. The
capitals can be on a two-tier system. [It would be] a federated system
based on the principle of identity between ethnic groups and the
territory they control. But control is not sovereign. Solutions to
recent inter-communal conflicts were not based on the British standard
solution of partition, but rather on power sharing and federation.
Dayton, Good Friday in Ireland, the aftermath of the bloody civil war in
Lebanon all involve power-sharing and confessional arrangements between
the parties.

Q: What about the South African example?

A: The only place there is a unitary system solution is South
Africa, but that's unique, and based not on partition but on majority
rule. There are many models of binationalism, but the only way its being
interpreted in Israel/Palestine is ""one man, one vote."" That's not
suitable and it's a model I reject. The [prediction that South
Africanization of the conflict means the] ""end of the Jewish state"" is a
scarecrow; it's suggested to show that binationalism cannot work. But
this is not the model I suggest. There should be a model that respects
national culture and channels the conflict between ethnic groups, and
not the system of majority over minority tyranny represented by one man,
one vote.

Q: Is the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) capable
of making the switch? After all, it rejected Abu Ala's suggestion.

A: Now, absolutely not--nor is the Zionist establishment in
Israel. The PLO thrives on the two state solution; the Palestinian
National Authority cannot survive without it. It is only when
[Palestinians] face the total bankruptcy of the PNA and its failure that
they will understand that not only did [the PNA] not do anything, it
ruined the chances of the Palestinians to get anything out of the
Israelis. The notion that there is a PNA is what allows the ongoing
occupation.

Q: Are there Palestinians who advocate your point of view?

A: There are a lot of them, but others cherish the pipedream
that they'll win the battle of the womb. A system that allows the
automatic victory of those that breed is impossible. I don't suggest
that Israel commit suicide. My system can be made to work with the
Palestinians. This is a Siamese twins situation of Israel and Palestine
living in one ecosystem in which only close binational cooperation will
work. If there's no close cooperation nothing will happen, and Israeli
domination and superior power will be the case forever.

Q: So matters will get worse before they get better?

A: Things are already bad enough. The only thing not clear to
people is where they are. Once the illusions are dispelled, people on
both sides will have to turn to interim agreements as steps toward the
creation of new conditions and a new level of cooperation. Unilateral
moves won't work. The current way--either a Palestinian state or
nothing--will lead us nowhere.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What was your reaction to Palestinian Prime Minister
Ahmed Qurei's (Abu Ala's) statement about a one state solution?

A: I think that any statement that comes from the Palestinian
Authority on the question of binationalism has to be seen within the
context of Palestinian weakness vis-a-vis Israel. In other words, I do
not think that this was a statement about what Abu Ala or anybody else
in the Palestinian Authority believes to be the ideal solution. Seeing
the facts on the ground, you would have to be blind or stupid--knowing
that this barrier wall is going up and land is being stolen from the
Palestinians every day--to go on believing that the Palestinian state is
a possibility. It is partly a bald statement about the facts.

But it is also possibly a scare tactic for the Israeli government,
saying, ""We know that the last thing you want is for us Palestinians to
live with you in one state, therefore if you don't want that to happen,
get your act together and give us viable territory.""

While I understand this position and am sympathetic to it because we are
witnessing the most appalling situation in Palestinian history since
1948--it has never been so bad as this--obviously, I come from a
position that is quite different. I have a belief that there should be
only one state in this part of the world, there should be no partition
of Palestine, and I cannot approve of the implied acceptance of Israeli
racism [in Abu Ala's statement], if that is what he is saying.

Q: Can you talk more about your position?

A: I do not hold this position because I thought it up over the
last year, or because I have despaired of the two state solution. If we
want a peaceful settlement to this terrible conflict to be a realistic
long-term solution, I believe there is only one solution, and that is
one state in Israel and the occupied territories. There would be one
state, a state of its citizens, which means that the people who live
there will be the Israeli Jews who live there today, plus a population
of Palestinians, partly who are now currently under Israeli occupation,
but partly those who were displaced in 1948 and their descendents. This
state will be called ""Israel/Palestine"" or whatever they want. Said
Hamami, the [Palestine Liberation Organization] representative in London
who was tragically assassinated, used to say that they can call it a
cucumber, if that is what they want.

Q: So what you are talking about is a process of
decolonization.

A: This is a very long process and a difficult one for Israel.
First there must be an end to the occupation and a process of
decolonization of the territories where the most recent settlements have
been put up.

But it is more than that. The whole question of Zionism has to be
confronted. The ideology that says that there must be a piece of
territory that is exclusively the preserve of this one group called
""Jews"" is utterly pernicious in my view. It is an ideology that has
caused enormous suffering for Palestinians. A state that sets itself up
with the ideology that ""we are going to create a place for ourselves no
matter if it is currently inhabited, and no matter what happens to those
natives;"" and then to actually get rid of the natives in order to make
that state; and then in order to keep it ethnically pure (which is a
ridiculous notion, not only in the 21st century but also for Israel
where 20 percent of the population is non-Jewish) to make sure that none
of the original inhabitants ever comes back; and then to stuff [the
state] as full as possible with Jews, no matter how phony these Jews are
(they could be a convenient lost tribe from Ethiopia or Russians of
which 40 percent are actually not Jewish)--this idea that created the
state of Israel is utterly pernicious. It is dangerous, it is malicious,
it is antidemocratic and it is racist.

It has not only damaged Palestinians, but many Jews who now have this
notion that they have a right to this territory, and that this territory
is solely their own. American Jews and British Jews, even though they
have no intention of living there themselves, want other Jews to live
there and do what has to be done in order to keep this situation going.

But I just want to be clear on one point. The moment one talks about
Zionism and the fact that it has to go and that the Jewish state has to
go, there is a reflex reaction of terror, panic, hatred and accusations
of anti-Semitism, plus the old canard that ""they will throw us all into
the sea."" Nobody is throwing anybody into the sea, I hope. And nobody is
going to massacre anybody, I hope.

Q: Why do you think that advocates of one state
solution are a minority in Palestinian politics?

A: The idea was first proposed in 1969 by the PLO and it didn't
get much further because it was instantly rejected by Israel. Also, the
power imbalance was very clear. The Palestinians could see that they
were a bunch of refugees up against a highly armed nuclear state. The
idea was seen as unrealistic and the PLO dropped it and started to talk
about the two state solution.

If you add to that the fact that the two state solution applies mostly
to those Palestinians under occupation, one can understand why their
first reaction is to get Israelis out of [the occupied territories].
Which is why I say that one might even have an arrangement where the
occupied areas are ""de-occupied"" and acquire an interim status, but
always with the idea that in the end everybody will be living together.
You need a leadership that proposes this idea, you need discussion of
this idea and you need to sell it.
"
"Isr","Neut","Since September 2000 the Palestinians have waged a war against Israel in
violation of their 1993 commitments to give up terror. Even a minimalist
interpretation of the Palestinian goals, in contrast to the credible
assertion that the Palestinian body politic still favors the destruction
of the Jewish state, shows rather meager results for the campaign. After
more than three years of terror, the Palestinians are not one inch
closer to the establishment of a Palestinian state. As a matter of fact,
much of the infrastructure for such a state was gradually destroyed in
the armed struggle, leaving the Palestinian Authority in shambles. While
important Palestinian systems, such as education and health, still
continue to function, other vital services have drastically
deteriorated, most notably public order and the dispensation of justice,
eroding public trust in the nascent Palestinian entity.

This entity has gradually turned into a fragmented society run by thugs
and local warlords. The international community increasingly views the
Palestinians as unable to govern themselves successfully. Even their
supporters are airing proposals for an international trusteeship--an
unlikely scenario--to help the Palestinians in their transition to
statehood.

In contrast, Israel has succeeded in denying Palestinian goals and was
successful in overcoming the international constraints on its freedom of
military action against targets in Palestinian-ruled territories,
thereby denying the Palestinian terrorists safe sanctuaries. Since
Operation Defensive Shield (March-April 2002) the terrorists, primarily
in the West Bank, are on the run. While some aspects of Israel Defense
Forces (IDF) operations still meet with international criticism, there
is much greater understanding for the Israeli need to carry out
offensive actions in self-defense against terrorism. Israel's record in
this respect, the foiling of over 90 percent of suicide bomber attacks,
is remarkable.

Undoubtedly, 9/11 was a turning point in the Israeli-Palestinian war.
This event sensitized much of the world, particularly the US, to the
Israeli dilemmas in fighting terrorism. In contrast, the Palestinian
leadership was hardly cognizant of the 9/11 effects and failed to change
gear by distancing the Palestinian struggle from terror. While the
suicide attacks constituted a serious security challenge to Israel, the
indiscriminate killings of civilians were clearly not perceived by the
international community as a legitimate act of resistance. The suicide
bombers actually helped Israel in the struggle over international public
opinion.

The Palestinians were also intent on internationalizing the conflict and
eliciting international intervention in accordance with the Kosovo
model. They failed, however. There is little willingness to send
international forces to serve as a buffer between Israelis and
Palestinians. Moreover, there is declining international readiness to
render financial support to the Palestinians, due to widespread
corruption. The resulting calls for greater transparency have slowed
down the stream of euros that basically allowed for greater
intransigence among the Palestinians. In addition, the emergence of new
foci for humanitarian aid, Iraq being only one example, limits the
amount of international funds available for transfer to the Palestinians.

Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian national movement, who was
the darling of even enlightened Western European states, has been
recognized as a curse for his people and an obstacle for peace. Much of
the world has learned to see Arafat as a leading factor in radicalizing
Palestinian society and pushing it to the brink, rather than building a
state.

The greatest Palestinian loss was the alienation of the center of the
Israeli political map and much of the Israeli left. The Israeli left
successfully championed greater empathy for the Palestinians and for the
corrupt Palestine Liberation Organization leadership. This was crucial
for moving Israeli society into greater readiness for territorial
concessions. Yet the Palestinian war discredited Yossi Beilin--now
leader of the new Yahad Party--and his contemporaries, moving Israeli
society into more centrist positions much less in accordance with
Palestinian demands. The majority of Israelis woke up from the ""peace
trip"" increasingly reluctant to take security risks for an agreement
with the untrustworthy Palestinians.

Israel's proposed unilateral disengagement is a Palestinian achievement
because Israel does not get anything in return for removing settlements
and for withdrawing from most of Gaza. Nevertheless, in light of
Israel's traditional readiness to accept partition and the general
consensus about the need to leave Gaza, unilateral disengagement is not
a Palestinian victory. If implemented, it will not drastically alter the
basic geostrategic equation. Even a similar limited withdrawal in the
West Bank will not be an Israeli defeat as long as Israel continues to
have freedom of action to police Palestinian territories and to control
entry.

The war will continue for a while with oscillating levels of violence.
As war is a competition in inflicting pain, Israel is in a better
position to harm the Palestinians than vice versa. In this war, the
Palestinians have suffered more than the Jews. The constraints imposed
by Israel's democratic character have spared the Palestinians more pain,
but may have prolonged the conflict because the Palestinians have
demonstrated their ability to sustain pain. Similarly, Israeli society
has shown remarkable tenacity and determination not to give in to
Palestinian terror. An assessment of the second equation in waging
war--the ability to bear pain--indicates inconclusive results. This is
not that surprising, as protracted conflict in other ethnic conflicts
usually shows that societies muster tremendous energies and willingness
to pay a heavy price in the attainment of collective goals.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: If it is said that Palestinians and Israelis are engaged
in a war, how then will Palestinians know that they have achieved victory?

A: We, the Palestinians, have been engaged in a war that the
Zionists have imposed upon us ever since 1948 when they left their
countries to occupy ours--from that time, they imposed the war on
themselves.

By their crime of occupying Palestine, they have caused and created
suffering for Palestinians for 56 years. In those years, they
slaughtered dozens of thousands of Palestinians aggressively and
unjustly, and exiled millions of them from their original lands and
properties. The exiled are still looking forward to returning to their
lands, cities, villages and houses. The Zionists also imprisoned dozens
of thousands of Palestinians; 7,000 of them remain imprisoned today.

The Zionists continue destroying our lives for no reason but that we
demand our legitimate rights and because we fight to put an end to the
tragedy and multi-faceted suffering of our people. Therefore, we think
that if the suffering of the Palestinians stops we have achieved victory.

Q: Are there different levels of victory, or will only a
complete victory be enough?

A: Of course there are different levels of victory, whereas
sometimes you can win by executing a plan to push Israeli tanks away as
they invade any area in our country--because at that time, you would
protect our children from being slaughtered by the Zionists.
Accordingly, that is a victory.

Also, when we force the enemy to leave any piece of our land without
giving up any of our legitimate rights as a price for that, we consider
this victory.

We might also win a round of confrontation or win the media war, thus
producing a victory in this expanding war. All of the things I have
mentioned are partial, field or periodic victories, but the perfect and
complete victory that Palestinians seek is that which can put an end to
their suffering, and achieved by regaining all of their comprehensive
and complete stolen rights.

Q: How does Islam define victory and is this important in
the Palestinian context?

A: In Islam, there is no specific definition of victory.
Muslims' concept of victory is the same as others'. How did the French
understand it when the Nazis occupied their lands' Or the Algerians,
when the French occupied their lands' The Vietnamese? Or even the
Americans themselves?

All of [these people] are still celebrating the anniversary of the date
that they pushed back the invaders or occupiers of their lands and
liberated their lands, accordingly ridding themselves of the slavery and
humiliation practiced by their occupiers. We as Muslims taste victory
the same way they did.

Therefore, I don't think that there is any misunderstanding between the
Palestinian factions, national or Islamic, about the definition of
victory; we all have the same concept of victory.

Q: Has the Palestinian definition of victory changed in the
last 50 years?

A: I think that the majority of Palestinians have the same
concept and definition of victory from 50 years ago, otherwise they
would have accepted all what has been offered them from 1948 until
today. [By this], I mean solutions that detract from their rights and
international resolutions, peace initiatives or signed agreements.

Some might say that the Palestinians have missed many opportunities, but
the fact is that they rejected defeat. Or we might say that they were
and are still seeking victory.

It is obvious that Palestinians still want and insist on regaining their
comprehensive and complete rights. They have consciously refused any
solution that detracts from their national and legitimate rights. The
Palestinians also have defended this decision strongly and paid a
precious price for that. [They have] sacrificed and are still
sacrificing because Palestinians understand that victory means
liberating the entire land.

Q: Is it possible that Palestinians might win the battle
with Israel but lose the battle within their own society?

A: I don't think it is possible, because Palestinians cannot win
the battle with the enemy unless they are able to win it within their
society after defeating the enemy.

Look at the deep significance of verses 40 and 41 from Surat al Hajj
(which is Sura 22 in the Holy Quran). In this verse, Allah says that
those who win rule themselves after they defeat their enemy, because the
people that are controlled by various groups that fight each other as
they fight the enemy cannot achieve victory. And if one day any one
people achieves victory, it will be due to their national triumph. If
they were unified during the battle, then they will be able to protect
and maintain their unity after achieving victory. Allah said this in his
Holy Quran, Surat al Anfal verse 46 and Surat al Assaf, verse 4.

Q: Do you believe that you will see victory in your lifetime?

A: I hope so, but I don't know when I will die, therefore, I
can't be certain that I will see it, or that I will not.

But I want to remind you that the enemy's might does not distance or
prevent the possibility of achieving victory. So many unjust countries
have collapsed while at their strongest. This is what happened to
Germany, to the former Soviet Union. It would not be strange for the
Zionist entity and the United States of America to collapse while they
are strong.

I think that the strong will of Palestinian youth is mightier than that
of the Zionist soldier by thousands of times. The battle itself has
never been one only of weapons because if that were so, the Zionists
would have conquered the Palestinian people by practicing their various
kinds of destruction and terror against the Palestinians. If that were
the case, [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon would have been able to
destroy the intifada and the Palestinian resistance in 100 days, as he
promised.
"
"Isr","Neut","The argument that wars have not broken out between democracies has
proven correct thus far. The argument that it is better to make peace
with democratic countries is also true: a democratic country is
obligated to its agreements, each new government continues where its
predecessor left off, and it makes decisions on the basis of broad
support--unlike some small clique that takes power and whose commitments
become irrelevant the moment a different faction takes over the country
in its stead.

These arguments have led figures like Natan Sharansky and Binyamin
Netanyahu to assert that democratic Israel cannot make peace with the
non-democratic Arab countries, and that it must wait until these
countries are democratic before it signs peace treaties with them.
Alternatively, as long as these states do not change their regimes,
Israel must demand wide security margins in making peace with them--so
wide that these countries will apparently be prevented from making peace
with us.

While in Israel this concept has not been universally accepted, the
United States, and particularly the Bush administration, has proven
receptive to these arguments: the cause of democratization plays a
central role in the American effort to advance the peace process in the
region. Any expression of reservation regarding this new approach is
liable to be interpreted as a reservation about democracy and, god
forbid, as support for reactionary regimes.

The truth is that those Israelis who raise the issue of democracy with
our neighbors as a precondition for any peace agreement are not exactly
waiting for the moment when an appropriate Palestinian partner will
appear in order to deliver over the West Bank and Gaza Strip and rid
ourselves of a 36-year-old occupation and the heavy demographic burden
that comes with it. These are right wingers who are convinced that time
is working in Israel's favor, who understand full well that the Arab
world will not become democratic in the near future, and who are
prepared to wait even for several generations until the neighboring
regimes change, because they are not prepared to pay the price of peace.

The real question that confronts us is not whether it is preferable to
reach peace agreements with democratic neighbors, but whether it is
right for Israel to wait for additional decades until this happens.
Doesn't the fact that in 2010 there will be more Palestinians than Jews
west of the Jordan River mandate an agreement at an earlier stage? Can
Israel maintain the burden of the occupation and the allocation of its
resources for the occupied territories for many more decades? Is
continuous war the situation in which we want to raise our children and
grandchildren instead of living normal lives like most countries?

Anyone answering in the negative has to conclude that peace will be made
with the Palestinians, the Syrians and the Lebanese when we find the
right balance between the national interests of the various parties,
regardless of the nature of their regimes. Perhaps wars have not broken
out between democracies, but peace treaties and other agreements have
been made between democratic and non-democratic countries (even between
Israel and Egypt and Jordan) without anyone feeling the need to demand a
regime change before adding his signature. Regional peace is likely to
accelerate the processes of democratization, and it is more likely that
this will happen than that Middle East regimes will soon become
democratic and thereby set the scene for peace agreements with Israel.

America's efforts to advance democracy in the region are worthy of our
admiration and our assistance. We recall that similar attempts were made
by the West in Egypt, Syria and other Arab countries in the 1930s and
1940s. These were far-reaching efforts, applied to a largely illiterate
population, and they failed. The next attempt should be made cautiously,
bearing in mind what happened in Algeria a few years ago when Islamic
radical elements exploited the new regime for their own dark purposes.
"
"Pal","Neut","The persistence of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is having a direct
and significant impact upon the development of democracy in both
societies. Israel is a country with thousands of intellectuals in a wide
range of fields. Still, since 1974 all of Israel's prime ministers have
been military leaders. Ehud Barak, Benjamin Netanyahu and Yitzhak Shamir
were either generals and/or ranking members of Israel's special forces
and intelligence services. This is militarization at its heart. It seems
very clear today that Israel is under the influence of a silent coup
d'etat where the military dominates politics, as well as the texture and
quality of democratic life.

Doubters should pick up the new book,/ Wars Don't Just Happen/, by Motti
Golani, which details Israel's culture of power. ""Since the creation of
the State of Israel in 1948, its leadership has generally preferred to
use force to solve problems, not all of which have been life-and-death
issues,"" writes Golani, as quoted in Ha'aretz. The consequences of this
approach are visible in the Israeli political system, where Israel's
ongoing military posture is strengthening the executive, to the
detriment of the legislative. Israel has a democratic system, but it is
what one might call an ethnic democracy, where ""tribalism"" rules. The
only way to escape this situation is to institute reforms. If the United
States is the model, only after the mid-1960s and the acceptance of
civic society and multiculturalism did democracy in the United States
flourish.

On the Palestinian side, the continuation of the conflict is directly
and blatantly responsible for the rise and strengthening of radical
Muslim movements that do not accept liberal democratic values in the
universal sense. Here I am differentiating between political Islam and
Islam the religion. The faith of Islam includes Sufis who are complete
pacifists, as well as the Osama bin Ladins of this world who divide
humanity into two groups: Muslims and the rest. The Palestinian
opposition group Hamas does not see things black and white in this
manner, but it also does not share in a vision of democracy that
incorporates liberal democratic values.

Another effect of the conflict is that it is making more and more
Palestinians poor, at least for the moment. There is a correlation
between education, income and democracy and it has been shown that
poverty and democracy are not highly compatible.

But the protraction of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is not only
having a detrimental effect on democracy's development in Palestinian
society, but democracy in the entire Arab world. These acts of terror in
Morocco and Riyadh are at least in part related to the continuation of
outstanding Palestinian claims.

Simultaneously, the conflict is preventing real debate. In my own
personal example, at the end of 2001, a visitor from the Palestinian
security services came to my house late at night. He never mentioned my
name per se, but the conversation centered on his opinion that this
Intifada is a time of war and that in war, the rules of the game are
changed. He told me that in such times, ""we"" cannot tolerate Birzeit
professors using their positions at the university to criticize the
Palestinian president. This argument has been used throughout the Arab
world during periods--like today--when Arab states have been under
attack. In the din of battle, all other voices are expected to stay
silent.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: Is the current parallel political instability in Israel
and Palestine coincidental?

A: No doubt there is a connection. The political paralysis in
Israel and Palestine has something in common. In Israel the composition
of the Knesset does not allow any real progress toward peace. On the
Palestinian side, the rivalry between Yasser Arafat and the rest of the
leadership has the same effect.

Q: In Israel, coalition negotiations with Labor begin this
week. What are the chances for success?

A: I don't bet on a longstanding partnership, because basically our
[Labor's] concept and Sharon's are entirely different. We are ready to
join him for a limited period of time, only to make sure he is the one
that dismantles settlements and starts the withdrawal. This is the only
reason.

If there is no Likud readiness to make substantial changes in the
government guidelines, there is no real chance for a coalition. In Gaza
we need a concrete and shorter timetable for withdrawal. If this doesn't
change and there is no change in [Finance Minister Binyamin] Netanyahu's
social agenda, we have no reason to join.

Q: Is there a basis of mutual trust between Labor and Likud
on the Gaza disengagement issue?

A: What Sharon really wants is to solidify his grip on the West
Bank and materialize his vision of the final boundaries of Israel,
giving the Palestinians sovereignty in seven West Bank enclaves and
Gaza, with Israel retaining half the West Bank under its control. We may
join his coalition not because we accept the entire plan or don't see
the deception, but because we want him to take the first step of
dismantling settlements and to pave the way for us in the future.

Sharon's plan is based on the false assumption that there is no
Palestinian partner. He made sure there is none by giving nothing to a
possible moderate partner, because such a partner would not accept his
final vision of seven enclaves plus Gaza as a Palestinian state. So
there is no reason for us to stay in Sharon's coalition beyond limited
disengagement.

Q: As a veteran observer of the Palestinian scene, how do
you think the current Palestinian governmental crisis will be resolved?

A: We are talking as events occur every hour. This upheaval may
evolve into substantial changes in the Palestinian political structure.
But one thing is for sure: there is great discontent among the
Palestinian population. I have been talking with Palestinians for the
last two weeks; there is great discontent with Arafat. One day the
Palestinians in the territories will say enough is enough to
incompetence. To quote what General Nasser Yusuf told Arafat in a bitter
argument, ""All the national revolutions in this generation have
succeeded, but yours.""

Q: Is Israel's disengagement plan a positive or negative
catalyst for Palestinians?

A: Paradoxically, though I don't like the hidden agenda of this
plan, which is annexation of at least half the West Bank, I think it
stimulated the Palestinians to action. For the first time, they
responded in a [historically] Zionist way. They said okay, what you
give, we take. At least somebody like Mohammad Dahlan spoke in this
spirit, and this is very encouraging.

Q: Whether or not Labor joins the coalition, the next
Israeli elections have to be held within a little over two years. Are
the settlements and disengagement issues likely to affect those elections?

A: In this regard, the next election in Israel should be one of
national decision and not national consensus.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: In your view, what prompted the kidnappings in the Gaza
Strip?

A: First of all, using arms against others for political purposes
is a very bad development in Palestinian internal relations. Causing
problems in Gaza now is not helpful for the Palestinians, even though
internal pressure for reforms in the Palestinian Authority is necessary.
These events took place because there is conflict between those in power
now and those who want more power in the Authority in general and in
security agencies in particular. It is not an issue of security reforms
but of who is in power.

Q: Why did Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmad Qurei (Abu Ala)
tender his resignation now, after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
finally agreed with him to restructure the security forces?

A: I think it was a mistake to tender his resignation before
giving the present government a chance to stop the conflict in Gaza. But
in general Abu Ala thinks he cannot continue like this because of the
government's lack of power, especially on security, which is controlled
by Arafat. The resignation of the government now will not support
reforms but will cause difficulties for all Palestinian goals. The
Israeli contention that there is no Palestinian negotiating partner will
be reinforced by this situation. The Israelis will continue their
escalation in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, using the lack of a prime
minister as an excuse not to talk to the Palestinians. At the same time,
the PA's difficulties with the United States will resume, since this
crisis seems to confirm US complaints about the Palestinian Authority.

If the government can succeed in its role by asking the Palestinian
masses to help stop this dangerous development, it can justify its place
in the Palestinian system. So this is a test for the Palestinian system.
If the PA can get control of the security situation, it will become more
powerful than before. If, on the other hand, the government resigns or
does nothing, the public judgment will be negative.

Q: What is the connection, if any, between the Palestinian
government's collapse and the Israeli government's search for a
coalition with Labor?

A: The connection is indirect, not direct. I think a coalition
government in Israel would strengthen Sharon's plan and add impetus to
the Palestinians' demands for more power in their government. Under a
coalition, Sharon's plan would be implemented faster. The PA's role is
being tested. If the PA has clear duties related to the disengagement
plan, especially for negotiations and security, it can continue working
with Egypt and others to manage Sharon's plan.

There are different positions among Palestinian groups regarding
Sharon's plan. The majority thinks we should not negotiate on the basis
of Sharon's plan and we should go back to the roadmap or the United
Nations. Sharon's plan is now different from what he gave to Bush and
what the Israelis have talked about with the Egyptians. None of the
Palestinians knows exactly what Sharon's plan is, but in general the
majority of Palestinians thinks this is a Sharon maneuver to create more
difficulties and that in the end Israel will not leave the Gaza Strip.
Abu Ala cannot continue working for political mobilization without a
united Palestinian concept on the Egyptian initiative and Sharon's plan.

Any initiative, even the Egyptian initiative, has a duty to clarify the
Israeli government's disengagement plan and the plan's relationship to
the wall and to withdrawal from PA territory, which is necessary for PA
elections to take place before March 2005. The PA has to think about the
new developments in Israel. Some Palestinians think a coalition
government in Israel will be worse for us; others think it will move
something and bring us back to the roadmap. I don't think that Sharon
and Likud will change their plans; Labor will accept Likud ideas, not
vice versa.

Q: In the Israeli case, the dismissal of corruption charges
against Sharon has made a coalition with Labor possible for the first
time. What effect do ongoing charges of corruption against Arafat and
other PA officials have on Palestinian coalition building?

A: In Israel, even though there is not a complete legal case
against Sharon, the majority thinks that Sharon has a relationship with
corruption. Corruption in the Israeli political system is clear in many
ways and with different ministers or former ministers. On the
Palestinian side, there are many issues of corruption in addition to the
main issue of how to stop Israeli aggression and the wall, which has
damaged all the Palestinian areas.

Palestinians think they will not be successful against Israeli
aggression without deep reform in their own political system. PA
corruption should stop, and we should go to the UN to make Israel
withdraw from PA territory so that we can hold elections under UN
supervision. Even if in Israel they manage with their corruption, we
cannot manage ours, because it means that the occupation will continue.
With elections, we can stop corruption and other abuses of the
democratic system. The legislative council is now discussing changing
the electoral system. Hopefully this will result in a more democratic
system.

Q: How will this crisis affect the Palestinian government
and agenda in the long term?

A: For the Palestinians, the first priority now is to stop this
crisis. The second is to disarm armed groups and implement reforms of
the security agencies, so that only trained professionals work in these
areas. We also need to address social and economic priorities, stop
corruption, and rebuild the damaged institutions of the PA and Palestine
Liberation Organization.
"
"Isr","Neut","It is clear to all that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has reached a
terrible low point.

About six months ago I proposed, together with former Knesset member Abd
al-Wahab Darawshe and Professor Yosef Ginat, the idea of a ""hudna"" (an
Arabic term meaning a ceasefire for a limited period). The idea was
embraced by President of Israel Moshe Katzav and by the leadership of
the Palestinian Authority (PA). The concept behind the initiative is to
apply the traditional Arab mechanism for resolving conflicts to the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute. The focus of this mechanism is on honor. We
feel that if we can learn to treat Palestinians with honor we can
register tremendous achievements politically. This sounds simple, but I
am certain that this is the key to solving the problem.

Following are the details of the proposal, as presented to the prime
minister by President Katzav, and as approved by the leadership of the
PA (formal approval by the Palestinian Cabinet was given on Dec. 17, 2001):

Phase I: President Moshe Katzav, leading a delegation of notables, comes
to the Palestinian National Assembly in Ramallah. He delivers a speech
""from heart to heart"" and calls upon both peoples immediately to
commence a total ceasefire for a year (hudna). His speech is followed by
a vote in which the Assembly ratifies the hudna.

Phase II begins immediately after the ceremony in Ramallah and continues
for several weeks. Both sides act to return to the status quo ante
September 2000.

Phase III follows (dependent on Israeli approval and on the PA proving
that it is making a 100% effort to activate the hudna): negotiations
commence between Israel and the PA in an attempt to reach a political
settlement--interim or permanent, as decided by the two parties. If the
parties register progress but do not reach agreement during the hudna
period, the Palestinians are committed to extend the hudna for another
year.

I believe with all my heart that realization of this initiative could
open a new era in the Middle East. But Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
declared his rejection of the initiative in late December 2001.

Half a year passed, a terrible half year in which the circle of violence
and suffering expanded and blood was spilled like water on both sides.
We decided not to give up, and to try again to promote a ceasefire. I
must note that we found in Yasir Arafat a serious partner to this
concept. On June 5, 2002 (a somewhat symbolic date) we renewed the
initiative. My good friend Abd al-Wahab Darawshe and I met with Arafat
in his office in Ramallah.

I proposed to Arafat an alternative road to a ceasefire: instead of an
official delegation appointed by the government of Israel that addresses
the Palestinian people on behalf of the government, I proposed to
organize an Israeli civil delegation, composed of Israeli citizens, each
of whom represents only himself. It is this delegation that would offer
the Palestinian people a ceasefire. I was delighted and appreciative
when Arafat agreed to the idea and committed the PA to the task of
achieving a ceasefire.

We invited a number of individuals and institutions to join us. We
appreciate the readiness of [former Foreign Minister] Professor Shlomo
Ben Ami to join the team leading the initiative, together with
[industrialist] Beni Gaon. We also turned to the Parents Circle--the
Family Forum [bereaved Israeli and Palestinian families supporting
reconciliation and peace], who accepted our invitation and
enthusiastically joined the ceasefire initiative.

A coordination meeting between our team and representatives of the PA
was held in Jerusalem on August 7, 2002, to advance the ceasefire
project. The Palestinian participants were Yasir Abd Rabo, Nabil Kassis,
Hassan Asfour, Samih al-Abid, Samir Rantisi and Ziad Abu Zayyad. The
Israelis were Shlomo Ben Ami, Beni Gaon, Abd al-Wahab Darawshe, Haim
Assa, Alberto Spektorowski, Parents Circle representatives Yitzhak
Frankental, Roni Hirshenson and Booma Shavit, and myself.

We agreed to promote a concept slightly different from the initial idea
that I presented to Arafat. We will organize a large convocation in
Jerusalem to declare a ceasefire and an end to hostile acts, to be held
in mid-September. (We also agreed to use the term ""ceasefire and
cessation of all hostile acts"" instead of ""hudna"".) We will invite 250
Palestinian representatives and 250 Israeli representatives. The
Palestinian group will comprise many of the 88 members of the
Palestinian parliament, as well as most of the Palestinian leadership.
We also agreed to a joint effort to invite international personalities
to the Jerusalem meeting, to provide sponsorship and thereby to enhance
the chances for success.

We are working shoulder to shoulder with our Palestinian partners to
finally bring about calm in our region.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What do you think of the recent discussions between
the Palestinian factions of Fateh and Hamas and the papers drawn up
declaring a ceasefire and a unified leadership?

A: I have seen the papers of all the leaderships and the paper of
Hamas itself and I have spoken much with the members of Hamas who are
involved in the drafting of this paper. I think that Hamas still
believes in the right to fight against Israel's occupation. Hamas
believes that Israel is occupying all of Palestine and Hamas is still
against signing on to the borders of 1967--the borders of the Gaza Strip
and the West Bank and Jerusalem.

In general, what is written in the paper is understood by everyone in
their own way and I do not think that the paper will put restraints or
borders on any group in fighting the occupation. Many of them still
believe that Israel will not respect any agreement and will continue the
assassinations and the demolition of homes and the killings of
Palestinians. There is no ceasefire, but there is some placing of a
system on fighting the occupation.

Q: Hamas has rejected the initiative. Why?

A: No one can give guarantees that Israel will agree to an end of
the occupation and they [Hamas] told the other factions frankly that you
cannot give Israel a free ticket, where they get everything and we get
nothing. How can you offer something good to Israel now, when we have
received nothing in these negotiations? For now, let us stay away from
putting our final signature [on the agreement], Hamas said. I think that
some of the faction leaders have been convinced by the ideas of Hamas.

Hamas has become very rigid on this point, in fact, and I talked with
[Hamas political leader Abdel Aziz] Rantisi about this and he said very
clearly that ""we do not recognize the 1967 borders at a time when Israel
is killing Palestinians in the heart of Nablus and other Palestinian
towns."" At the same time, I don't think that the Palestinian Authority
cares much about this. Now they have reached their own agreement, the
""Gaza and Bethlehem first"" plan. It is part of the policy of
[Palestinian President Yasser Arafat] that he does not care too much
about the opposition, and will continue to run the negotiations with
Israel as he likes.

Q: Hamas has always said that it will never be the cause
of a Palestinian civil war. But by continuing to carry out attacks
inside the Green Line, Hamas makes the Palestinian Authority and Fateh
look weak. In a way, it defeats them without a civil war.

A: I think that any time Hamas feels a danger of this, it knows when
to ease the situation. Now we have had three weeks without suicide
bombings--even Israel says that the situation is very quiet. I think
there is an open channel between Hamas and the Palestinian leadership
and it is not so difficult for them to reach a compromise [before civil
war breaks out]. Everyone believes that civil war means the destruction
of Palestinian society.

Q: What would be the conditions under which Hamas would
be willing to lay down arms against Israel? Or inside the Green Line?

A: Hamas does not reject the idea of a Palestinian state in the West
Bank and Gaza, but [Hamas spiritual leader] Sheikh Yassin always says
that we cannot forget the rest of Palestine and that the majority of
Palestinians are refugees who have the right to return to their homes.
Hamas still believes that there is no way to give up on the rest of
Palestine--but maybe it can accept a Palestinian state in the West Bank
and Gaza as a temporary solution.
"
"Isr","Neut","The premise of the Oslo process was that, since the Israelis have failed
to govern the territories successfully (Jews seem to be unfit for an
occupying role), they should find a suitable Palestinian to do it
effectively, someone who, in the words of the late Yitzhak Rabin, can
act ""without the High Court and without B'Tselem"" (i.e., would not be
troubled by its citizens having recourse to the High Court and civil
rights organizations). Israelis were led to believe that Arafat suited
the role of leader who could establish a Palestinian entity that would
have good neighborly relations with Israel.

This did not work very well, primarily because of Arafat's governing
style and political ambitions. He was unwilling to suppress the armed
opposition groups (Hamas and Islamic Jihad) that continued to engage in
terrorism against Israel. Moreover, the Palestinian Authority (PA)
expanded its own military capabilities by an increase in the number of
armed soldiers and by equipping them with mortars, anti-tank weapons and
man portable anti-aircraft missiles, all in flagrant violation of signed
agreements with Israel. In fact, Arafat allowed the PA and its security
organs to turn into what Israel Defense Force Chief of General Staff
Shaul Mofaz called ""a terrorist entity,"" which holds radical aspirations
such as the relocation of numerous Palestinian refugees to Israel.

Arafat seems unable to rule, i.e., to maintain a modicum of law and
order in the territories under his control. We are witnessing the
beginning of the ""Lebanonization"" of the PA, which is indicated by the
emergence of a myriad of armed groups displaying only partial loyalty to
Arafat. In addition, the deteriorating economic situation generated by
limited access to the Israeli market creates demands upon the PA, which
it is unable to meet, furthering the erosion in its authority and
legitimacy.

Such challenges are reinforced by widespread Palestinian perceptions of
the ruling elite as corrupt and authoritarian. The PA increasingly fails
to provide basic needs, such as personal security and a minimum standard
of living for its citizens. We may soon see the breakdown of the PA into
several cantons effectively ruled by new barons, who have almost full
monopoly over arms in their fiefdoms. The PA may well turn into a failed
state.

The desire to prevent the anarchical characteristic of failed states is
understandable and this is the main motivation for the attempts to save
and strengthen Arafat. Yet the belief that Arafat can change and behave
reasonably, or that a strong PA is beneficial for Israel, is questionable.

In short, Arafat and his coterie are part of the problem and not of the
solution. Therefore, we should think about a third option (in addition
to Israeli occupation and Arafat's rule)--chaos. This is not a pleasant
thought. Chaos in the territories poses a security problem to Israel.
Such a problem is less acute if the fragmented Palestinian armed groups
do not coordinate their low-intensity conflict against Israel. Anarchy
in the territories may allow Israel a freer hand in dealing with the
terrorists.

Indeed, a situation of chaos might ultimately yield positive results.
The collapse of the PA will weaken the young Palestinian national
movement. Palestinian nationalism has been a source of endemic violence
in the past and is a recipe for regional instability in the future. It
threatens at least two ""nice"" states--Israel and Jordan--and has
continuously supported policies of radical regimes such as Iraq and
Libya. It is also thoroughly anti-American.

The collapse of the PA and the failure of the Palestinian national
movement to establish a successful state might reduce the appetite of
the Palestinians for an independent entity. Although failures rarely
affect the political fortunes of Arab leaders (as with Egyptian
President Gamel Abdul Nasser or Iraqi President Saddam Hussein), Arafat
as a symbol of the Palestinian national movement might be seriously
tainted in the case of the PA falling apart, and this could bring to the
forefront a more realistic and conciliatory leadership.

It is misleading to portray Hamas as the only alternative to Arafat. It
is his current ally. Moreover, the disintegration of the PA would be a
public relations debacle for the Palestinians and would elicit greater
understanding in the world for Israeli fears of its destructive
implications.

Disorder in the territories could be the incentive for fresh thinking on
the Palestinian issue on the part of the Palestinians, as well as
elsewhere. More chaos in the Palestinian-ruled territories might open up
new opportunities to stabilize the situation. The internecine violence
of the previous Intifada led to acceptance of the Madrid conference
formula--a clear indication of growing political realism among the
Palestinians. The failed PA experiment could be a sobering experience
leading to a more politically mature body politic.

Chaos as an interim situation is not necessarily the worst-case
scenario. Therefore, Israel might have an interest in Arafat taking a
fall.
"
"Pal","Neut","When discussing the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), one should
differentiate between the significance of its existence as a moral
entity for the Palestinian people - the first authority established on
parts of Palestine - and its performance. Has the Palestinian Authority
succeeded, after seven years of building institutions and bodies yearned
for by Palestinians for decades, to rest itself on the proper
institution-building foundations and the supports of freedom, democracy,
equality and justice for individuals?

Primarily, support for existence of this authority comes from the
principle of its existence, not the physical role it fulfills for the
Palestinian people. It does not meet the requirements of real
institutions despite its various ministries, which after seven years of
establishment, have proven unable to adopt decisions independent of the
power of the individual symbol represented in President Yasser Arafat.

This situation applies to both the executive and legislative
authorities, as both are governed by the desires of this symbol. They do
not stray beyond his orders and his instructions, the limits required to
gain his devotion. The same situation applies to the legal authority,
which is nearly non-existent and where judges act according to
instructions received by higher-ups.

In many cases, we find the court system paralyzed and unable to
implement even its own decisions. This is felt through the multiple
decisions issued by the Palestinian legal system on specific political
cases, in which the legal system was unable to implement its own
decisions. Implementation requires the will of the political symbol that
receives the Authority's absolute loyalty in all of its institutions and
structures. It can be said that this symbol has become the sole
individual running all institutions and structures, starting from the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and ending with the National
Authority as a political apparatus (not to mention the legislative
institutions, as well as bodies comprising Fatah, the major faction in
PLO).

Still, the Authority, even as it is buffeted by internal, exterior and
regional conditions, plays an essential role for those people who
engaged in decades of struggle and, therefore, earned the opportunity to
build their institutions. As such, the Palestinian National Authority is
vital, regardless of who is currently in charge. It is important to us
that the PNA exists as an entity that has gained legitimacy from that
very Palestinian struggle, one lasting over 50 years. We recognize that,
while people are not eternal, whatever their age, the Authority as an
entity will endure.

In the future, we will undertake the responsibility of transferring it
from this period of weakness and absence of strong institutions to the
stage of state-building, once this authority realizes its sovereignty
and power on the ground. The same is true for the establishment of laws
and bylaws worthy of a unique Palestinian state, including the abolition
of the combination of Egyptian and Jordanian laws and Israeli military
orders now applied to the territories seized in 1967.

It is true that the recent Aqsa Intifada has bridged a gap between the
Palestinian National Authority and the Palestinian masses. But this gap
can be expected to soon widen once again, causing more rifts if the PNA
does not begin building its institutions even during its political
conflict with Israel.

The PNA must take initiative in fighting corruption, corrupt people, and
expediting the process of putting its house in order, making violators
accountable and putting the right person in positions of authority.

The PNA must also choose a path that will qualify it as an entity like
all other entities in the region. It has to determine the route it will
go--either it realizes statehood with all the accompanying symbolic,
political and national connotations, or it remains what it is now:
neither an authority nor a revolution.

Even though we are talking about the National Authority, this does not
exempt the Palestinian factions from their own responsibilities. In the
same manner that the PNA must rid itself of those damaging its
reputation and failing their responsibilities, the factions, too, must
follow through.

If we want to talk about political pluralism within one authority, the
PNA must start reforming corrupt internal practices and extend bridges
to several other political movements, in order to accomplish the shaping
a national unity authority or a national government. This authority must
encompass the hopes of the masses and their aspirations for a real
government that represents them and protect their interests and is
capable of handling the intensifying political confrontation with the
launching of the negotiations process.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: In both the Likud and Labor everything appears to be
revolving at present around Yasir Arafat and the political process. Is
it healthy for Israeli politics when Arafat is our no. 1 political player?

A: Indeed, a popular issue connected to the Palestinian question
is being used to try to gain control over each party. In the Likud,
Binyamin Netanyahu believes that if he won a vote to reject a
Palestinian state, he has won the leadership. In Labor, Haim Ramon hopes
to pull the party out of the government by raising the unilateral
withdrawal issue and exploiting the general frustration. I don't believe
in this approach; it's wrong to act in this way. After all, if Bibi
[Netanyahu] becomes prime minister he'll find himself stuck with a
decision negating a Palestinian state that he himself rammed through the
Central Committee, and he'll have to change his position and acquiesce
in a solution based on a Palestinian state.

Q: Nevertheless, did Netanyahu register a victory here? Was
Sharon weakened?

A: Netanyahu may have won a battle, but he lost the war. You have
to lead, not run after the herd. This absence of leadership contributes
to the general public's frustration with politicians.

Q: Are you hinting that you intend to run again for
leadership of the Likud?

A: As the next primaries approach I may be a contender; I never
abandoned this option.

Q: Will the maneuvers you have described in Labor and the
Likud lead to early elections?

A: I don't think so. Labor won't leave the coalition now, since
it has nowhere to go. Fuad Ben Eliezer in any case has no one to talk to
among the Palestinians, so what's the point of all the concessions he is
presenting? As for the Likud Central Committee, it cannot dictate to the
government how to act, nor is it requested to approve political
agreements. A mere minority of members of the Central Committee voted
against a Palestinian state; most members didn't even participate in the
meeting. In the final analysis, neither the Likud nor Labor is
important, but the State of Israel. Here we have forgotten about the
rest of our problems, our difficult domestic problems. Perhaps we should
inform the Palestinians that for the time being there will be no
political track, while we deal with domestic affairs.

Q: Is the Palestinian state that Sharon conceives of (a state
limited more or less to the territories currently under Palestinian
control, for a prolonged interim period) realistic?

A: First of all, just as the Palestinians say they insist on 100
percent, we too have the right to present any position we like as an
opener for negotiations. The interim period is designed to enable the
reconstruction of the Palestinian economy, while a Palestinian entity
controls 95 percent of the Palestinian people. If we negotiate the
Palestinian issue at a regional conference then it will be with the Arab
states, not Arafat. They'll present their solution and we'll present
Sharon's minimalist position.

Q: The prime minister has long argued that there already is a
de facto Palestinian state. As Israel's Minister of Justice, do you
believe there still exists such a de facto state? Didn't Operation
Defensive Shield destroy this state?

A: The Palestinian Authority controls 95 percent of the
Palestinian people, and its borders are clearly defined. Governmental
systems and institutions, such as education, exist. Hence this is still
a de facto state, albeit one that supports terrorism, which we had no
alternative but to strike hard at.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: How do you view the recent Likud meeting in which the
Israeli Likud Party reiterated its opposition to Palestinian statehood?

A: This shows that that particular faction in the Likud is the
only group in the entire world that opposes the creation of a
Palestinian state. Even the camp of [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel]
Sharon in the Likud could not agree with [former Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin] Netanyahu and his group. Ultimately their views will not have
any impact on the international consensus over the Palestinian state,
including the strategic ally of Israel, the United States, which now
talks about both Palestine and Israel.

We know that there is competition between Netanyahu and Sharon, but the
Likud leaders headed by Netanyahu have to act as leaders, responsible
leaders, and their decisions and attitudes must take into account the
interests of the Israeli people and peace and stability. By adopting
this aggressive position they are only further isolating themselves.
They will have a very hard time finding a respectable group in the world
to share this position.

Q: Do you see this in any way as a setback for
Palestinian statehood?

A: No, because we are not expecting any better from a group that
is opposed by Sharon himself, whom we consider the ultimate form of
radicalism here. It is a setback for the Likud Party and for the people
who champion this attitude and it is a setback for Israel, because
Israel should not take any pride in being the only isolated voice across
the world opposing Palestinian statehood, which was endorsed by the
international community, a United Nations Security Council resolution,
the position of the United States, and so on.

Sooner or later, a Palestinian state is going to be there and this
incumbent government takes no credit for delaying that eventuality.

Q: What do you make of the jockeying in the Labor Party,
where Haim Ramon seems to be calling for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal
and Fuad Ben Eliezer is going back to Camp David?

A: I think that there are politicians in Israel who put their own
agendas ahead of the national agenda, at the expense of regenerating the
conflict and hurting efforts to reach peaceful agreement with
Palestinians. These personal agendas and interests explain why, for
example, Ben Eliezer and others in the Labor Party are still serving in
the Sharon government to the dislike of many Labor Party leaders. I
think the Labor Party has managed to destroy every sign of
differentiation from the Likud Party and its policies. This will only
hurt the Labor Party in future elections.

Q: It seems that the thing that all of these ideas have
in common is that they assume that there is no Palestinian partner for
peace. How can Palestinians get past that Israeli perception?

A: This is called pretextual politics. The Likud and Sharon want
to avoid sitting and negotiating seriously on the issues of the
conflict: borders, Jerusalem, settlements and statehood. Sharon opposes
all of these things. If he sat and negotiated all of these things in
good faith, he would have saved Israel and the Palestinians a lot of
bloodshed.

The Labor Party adopted the same argument because it is weak. This is a
party that is unable to have its own distinct agenda, a party that has
failed to defend agreements that the Labor government signed with
Palestinians, a party that is too weak and opportunistic to speak to the
real cause of the collapse of the peace process, which is Sharon.
Between a party that has no peace agenda and a party that is too weak to
insist on its own distinct agenda, both have agreed to look for a
scapegoat under the pretext of security and violence, which are only
symptoms.

The real problem is the occupation and the unwillingness of these two
parties to say that the occupation is the source of all evils and then
end it. If it ends, at least one of the problems would be solved. They
know that Palestinians are not quarreling with Israel's right to exist
or its legitimate security concerns. When Israel insists on ignoring the
Palestinians, ignoring their legitimate rights and ignoring their
grievances, insisting on staying as an occupying power, what do they
expect from Palestinians? That they give them flowers?
"
"Isr","Neut","Israel ratified the ""Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection
of Civilian Persons in Time of War"" and, under international law, is
bound to apply its provisions. The convention deals with protecting
civilians in time of war, with particular emphasis on the protection of
civilians who are considered ""enemy"" nationals. The convention grants
various protections to such enemy nationals including conditions of fair
trial, conditions of detainment and visits by Red Cross representatives.
Another part of the convention applies explicitly to civilians in
""occupied enemy territory"". Israel applies the provisions of the
convention that relate to ""enemy civilians"" and little controversy has
arisen in their application. The public debate relates to whether the
West Bank and Gaza are ""occupied enemy territory"" for the purposes of
the convention.

Classic international law defines occupied territory as the sovereign
territory of a state that is under the military occupation of another
state at a time when a state of war exists between them. International
law forbids the occupying state from annexing the occupied territory,
and requires the occupier to set up a military government in the
territory. This military government is subject to the restrictions
imposed by the laws of occupation of international law.

Since the demise of the Ottoman Empire, the West Bank and Gaza Strip
have not been the sovereign territory of any state. Jordan acted after
1948 as sovereign in the territories of the West Bank, but Jordanian
control ended in the 1967 Six-Day War. Jordan has since relinquished its
claim to sovereignty. Egypt has never staked any claim to sovereignty in
the Gaza Strip. A Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza has not
yet been established, and its borders have not been determined.

In view of the uncertainty as to sovereignty in these territories,
Israel's position is that its administration could not be categorized as
the occupation of the sovereign territory of another state and that the
de jure applicability of the convention to the West Bank and Gaza ""is
doubtful"".

Notwithstanding its formal position, Israel has undertaken to apply the
""humanitarian provisions"" of the convention. The phrase ""humanitarian
provisions"" used by Israel is intended to make the statement that Israel
would be applying those provisions whose object was the protection of
the local population and would not be applying those provisions whose
object was to protect the rights of a--non existing--sovereign state. In
practice no such distinction has been made and the Israel Supreme Court
enforces all the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

There is no Israeli legislation enforcing the convention. The convention
is regarded as a basic text of international humanitarian law and has
been referred to as reflecting international customary law; yet in
practice no state has ever formally applied it to a given occupied
territory. The closest to formal application has been Israel, which
applies the ""humanitarian provisions"" of the convention to the West Bank
and Gaza. Neither the US nor the UK has formally applied it to their
administration of Iraq. Israeli courts regard customary international
law as automatically part of Israeli law and hence enforceable. However
due to the absence of state practice in applying the Convention, the
courts reached the conclusion that the convention is not yet customary
law and hence not enforceable. Notwithstanding this, the attorney
general has consistently agreed that the courts examine acts of the
Israel Military Administration in accordance with the rules set out in
the convention, and the High Court of Justice routinely does so.

Even if Israel were to formally apply the convention there would still
remain a fundamental difference as to its interpretation as regards the
legality of Jewish settlements.

Article 49 of the convention prohibits an occupier from transferring
""parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies"".
Many legal authorities interpret this as forbidding the establishment of
Jewish settlements in the territories. Israel disputes this interpretation.

A further issue would be the application of the convention to East
Jerusalem. Israel has applied its law to East Jerusalem and the Arab
inhabitants are considered permanent residents of Israel. Needless to
say there is no military administration there. The UN Security Council
has however passed a resolution declaring that East Jerusalem is
occupied territory and the convention applies.

Another issue is whether the convention applies to areas controlled by
the Palestinian Authority (Areas A and the Gaza Strip). Here again
Israel does not consider the convention relevant.

To sum up, there are legitimate doubts as to sovereignty in the West
Bank and Gaza and whether provisions of the convention applying to
occupied territory of an enemy state are applicable. The humanitarian
provisions of the convention are enforced by the Israeli courts and
formally applying the convention would not materially change the
situation in this regard. Furthermore, fundamental differences of
interpretation and application as regards settlements and East Jerusalem
would remain even if Israel were to recognize the applicability of the
convention.

The question of sovereignty, it is submitted, must be settled by
establishing a border between Israel and a future Palestinian state and
not by arguing over the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What is your immediate reaction to talk in Israeli
circles about formally applying the Fourth Geneva Convention to the
occupied territories?

A: My immediate reaction is that Israel has been in violation of
the Geneva Conventions since 1967, but that Israel is currently under
international pressure, largely because of the case [on the wall] that
was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to try and
bring its actions a little more into compliance with international law.
I think Israel is afraid of being in the position of a pariah state,
like South Africa was.

Q: Is this largely a legal or diplomatic move?

There are two issues here. There is the political and public relations
dimension and there is the legal dimension. The legal dimension is a
little problematic, because the ICJ does not have any mechanism to
implement its decisions. It is only a question of public relations and
how a country is viewed among other nations. The power to impose
sanctions for violations of international law is vested with the UN
Security Council under Chapter 7, and Israel is assured of a US veto
whenever such a threat arises.

However, in the case of South Africa where sanctions were initially not
applied because of the US and British veto, there was a groundswell of
grassroots actions such as boycotts, withdrawal of investments as well
as a public relations campaign which in the end succeeded in bringing an
end to apartheid and the regime of racism in South Africa.

Israel does not wish to be in this position, and therefore it has
undertaken an aggressive public relations campaign to attempt to appear
to be at least in some compliance with international law in order to
avoid such a groundswell of popular sentiment against it as a violator
of international law.

Q: If Israel was to officially accept that the Geneva
Conventions applied to the occupied territories wouldn't that undermine
its case vis-a-vis the status of those territories?

A: Of course it would. There are consequences to such acceptance.
I think they will try to pretend to accept the Geneva Convention by
giving their own interpretation of it that takes the spirit out of it.
For example, for a long time they've said that while they don't accept
the de jure applicability of the convention they voluntarily comply with
the ""humanitarian provisions"" of the convention without of course saying
what these are. So to the uninformed they appear to be in compliance and
the issue of non-compliance becomes a political rather than a legal
issue. Then they can say, as they often do, that the United Nations is
always against them, there is an automatic majority, and therefore they
don't have to listen to the UN.

Now they are faced with the ICJ, which is not a political but a judicial
body. So they are feeling pressure to take some action or say some words
and improve the appearance of compliance. Of course, Israel has not said
it will accept the convention, it has also not said it will take
specific action based on such acceptance. There was only a suggestion to
study the idea of complying with the convention. I think once they look
at the practical consequences of such a step, they will realize that it
requires a radical change in their policies on many levels, including of
course the whole issue of the legality of the settlements, the changes
on the ground that they have and continue to carry out, the refusal to
abolish collective punishment which is totally prohibited under the
Geneva Conventions, the restrictions on the level of changes they can
make to the legal structure in the occupied territories. There are just
too many issues they would have to deal with if they were to seriously
accept the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

Q: So you think it's more of a public relations exercise
than anything serious?

A: I certainly suspect so.
"
"Isr","Neut","About 60 years ago I was a member of the Jewish underground in Eretz
Yisrael/Palestine. I was a member of the Hagana, and in 1944 I was
conscripted into the Palmach, the Hagana's standing unit that was at the
command of the elected institutions of the Jewish Yishuv, or community.

In 1945 I was dispatched on my first military action, a demonstrative
act of sabotage at 10 locations along the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem railroad.
We considered our military struggle to be a legitimate one: we sought to
end the British Mandate and establish an independent and sovereign
Hebrew state. In the short term we had two objectives: we demanded
annulment of the ""White Paper"" and the British lands act, along with
entry into the country of hundreds of thousands of Jews who had survived
the Nazi extermination camps.

We were convinced that we were waging a legitimate and moral struggle.
The British called it acts of terrorism. It was a classic example of the
difficulty of finding an agreed definition. To my mind the definition
was pure and simple: the key to distinguishing between a legitimate
struggle and acts of terrorism is not the strategic objectives of the
perpetrator; rather, it lies in the tactics of warfare and the targets
that are hit.

Recently we were once again confronted with this issue in the case of a
letter signed by 27 Israel Air Force (IAF) pilots, who declared that
they would refuse in future to take part in military actions against
targets located in populated areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They
refused to engage in any offensive action that could inadvertently end
up in injury to innocent civilians.

I can understand the writers' spirit. But I completely reject their
collective refusal to obey orders. This refusal is primarily political,
not moral.

Since the insane slaughter carried out by Border Patrol soldiers in Qafr
Qassem (October 1956), the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has openly
defined what constitutes a clearly illegal command. According to this
definition, not only is it unnecessary to carry out such a command, but
anyone who does carry it out cannot claim immunity because he was ""only
obeying orders"".

I share the IAF pilots' political outlook. I too want the Israeli
occupation to end, with the vast majority of the settlements removed and
a political agreement accepted by both sides. Yet despite the 36 years
that have elapsed since June 1967, there was nothing illegal or immoral
about the IDF conquest of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and we should
not confuse a political debate with illegal acts of disobedience.

Unlike Palestinian terrorism that is consciously, deliberately and
almost exclusively directed against innocent Israeli civilians, not a
single military task assigned to the Israeli security forces has been
consciously and with forethought intended to injure civilians. Sadly,
the hiding places of Palestinian terrorists are almost always located in
the midst of heavily populated urban areas.

Some 60 years ago, at the height of World War II, we witnessed countless
military acts that were deliberately directed against innocent civilian
populations. Nazi Germany started it when its planes indiscriminately
bombed the cities of Poland, and continued with similar bombings of
cities in Holland, Belgium and France, followed by the brutal blitz of
British cities. The Allies' acts of revenge in bombing Germany and later
Japan were no different. Both were clearly illegal acts under the IDF's
code of ethics.

I have been involved in Israel's wars since November 29, 1947. All these
wars, without exception, were hard and cruel. Yet I am proud that I
never was concerned over an issue involving our moral code of warfare.
There were--and I fear will be in future--unintended acts of aggression;
not a few soldiers at the local level have exceeded orders and violated
recognized moral norms. But never was a command given to strike
deliberately at civilians.

Despite my differences of opinion with the government's policies, I'm
satisfied that this same government maintains the moral code of warfare
of the IDF and of the people of Israel at a high level.
"
"Pal","Neut","The overwhelming and ongoing atrocities have left most Palestinians with
little space and peace of mind to ponder and intellectualize over the
moral question of our resistance; most of the time our reactions to
events are instinctive and emotional. Those few who still consider the
moral, political and strategic aspects of the Palestinian struggle may
find themselves at an impasse due to all the contradicting factors: the
cruelty of war that hurts the conscience and boggles the mind.

In assessing the Palestinians' resistance, one must take into
consideration the troubled context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The occupation of Palestine started with an ideology that denied the
very existence of the Palestinian people and pursued a colonial agenda
asserting divine claims to acquire the ""land without the people."" It was
in order to gain recognition as a national group, thus defying the
colonial agenda, that Palestinians resorted to hijacking in the seventies.

Still today, Palestinians have no state or conventional army. We are
subjected to curfews, expulsions, home demolitions, legalized torture,
and a wide variety of human rights violations. There is a glaring
contrast between the level of official responsibility and the systematic
nature of the violence exchanged between Palestinian individuals and the
state of Israel. The media has attributed our search for freedom to
""terrorism"", thus making the Palestinian the international prototype for
the terrorist. This impression has shaped Western public consciousness
and resulted in an international bias that tends to convey instances of
violence against Palestinian civilians in neutral language, reducing
Palestinian losses to mere statistics, while using emotional language
and visuals to describe Israeli losses.

The negotiations with Israel have given us nothing but promises of
autonomy over our impoverishment, implementing what is acceptable to the
mighty and treating facts established illegally as the basis for a
settlement. Most missing in this peace process was an honest peace
broker. The United Nations has been unable to take steps to ensure the
implementation of Palestinian rights. The world has offered not a single
remedy for the numerous wrongs Palestinians have endured; the American
veto in the Security Council has been used repeatedly against the broad
consensus calling for an international monitoring presence in the West
Bank and Gaza. The relentless denial of Palestinian rights without an
effective international response has left us acutely aware that
self-help is our only hope. We are facing a brutal occupation with bare
chests and empty arms.

International law gives a people fighting an illegal occupation the
right to use ""all necessary means at their disposal"" to end their
occupation, and the occupied ""are entitled to seek and receive support""
(I quote here several United Nations resolutions). Armed resistance was
used in the American revolution, the Afghan resistance against Russia,
the French resistance against the Nazis, and even in the Nazi
concentration camps, or more famously in the Warsaw Ghetto. Palestinian
resistance varies from that which is non-violent and widespread: simply
continuing to live, study, pray and plant in occupied land despite all
the odds, to active resistance and the use of violence. This violent
resistance can be defensive (and to my mind morally acceptable), such as
the resistance of the fighters of Jenin refugee camp as Israeli death
machines approached, or in the form of unacceptable offensive acts, such
as the bombing of Israelis celebrating a Passover meal. In all these
cases, it is individuals that choose their form of resistance; the
choices they make should not color the entire nation. And, as we have
seen, both peaceful and violent resistance is met with profound state
violence from the Israeli side. The death of American activist Rachel
Corrie is evidence of that.

Violent resistance arises from an inhuman military occupation, one that
levies punishment without fairness, denies the possibility of livelihood
and diverts the prospects of a promising future. The Palestinian people
have not gone to another people's homeland to kill or dispossess. Our
ambition is not to blow ourselves up in order to terrify others. We are
asking for what all other people have and deserve, a decent life in a
homeland.

What is most troubling about the critiques of our resistance is that
they seem to care little about our suffering, the withholding of what we
once possessed, and the violation of our most basic rights. Our murder
leaves those critics cold. Our peaceful, everyday struggle to have a
decent life leaves no impression. There is outrage and condemnation when
some of us follow the instinct of retaliation and revenge. Israeli
security is deemed more important than our livelihood; Israeli children
more human than ours; Israeli pain more inflammatory than ours. They
dismiss us as terrorists, enemies of human life and civilization. And so
I emphasize, it is not for their sake that we must revisit our
resistance, but because we care about Palestinian morality and morale.

To submit to injustice is incompatible with psychological health.
Resistance is a right, a duty and a remedy for the oppressed. It is
important, however, to design limits for the use of arms. Palestinian
resistance must be explored and assessed from the perspectives of law,
morality and politics, taking timing and context into account and with
sensitivity for widely-shared norms of behavior. Palestinians need to be
creative in providing effective peaceful alternatives for resistance
that can invite the progressives of the world to join our struggle. The
strength of the Palestinian plight lies in its moral, humanitarian
characteristics; we should find moral, humanitarian means to protect
that strength.
"
"Isr","Neut","The weekend papers in Israel were full of the Sharon speech at Herzliya,
giving it the usual spin of optimism. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon talked
about the possibility of coordinating the Israeli withdrawal with the
Palestinians, but his pathos of historic optimism was directed toward
the Israeli public, describing the coming year 2005 as a year of
historic opportunity to change Israel's strategic situation from the
bottom up.

I looked for the words peace or Palestinian state and didn't find them,
even though on the radio, right after the speech, the impression was
created that Sharon said the Palestinians could establish their state in
the coming year. But what was reported off-hand in a closing sentence
was that Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) was negative in his reaction to
Sharon, saying: ""Sharon is the obstacle to peace. We reject his
declarations as a whole and one by one"".

The two factors that combine to strengthen Sharon's position of
unilateralism are the death of Yasser Arafat and the reelection of
George W. Bush. When Sharon is talking of an historic opportunity he
means that, indeed, Israel is in some ways entering into favorable
strategic conditions almost to the extent of the opportunities which
were opened 15 years ago with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Not only
was the rear guard of the Arab enemies of Israel broken then, but a
major Arab enemy was crushed in 1991, thus creating what seemed like a
very favorable environment. Then came the Oslo accords and the
opportunity was lost, ushering in instead a new era of terrorism, the
politics of mass murder.

Sharon's opportunity now is to tear Israel from the clutches of peace
negotiations with the Palestinians as well as other Arab countries. The
kind of unilateralism embodied in disengagement means that Israel
regains control over its own fate, abandoning for good the dangerous
premise that its existential problem will be solved only in accordance
with the solution of the Palestinians' problems. A Palestinian state now
becomes only an option that Israel does not exclude, about which it
remains for the Palestinians to decide.

Abu Mazen's rejection of Sharon's speech clearly indicates that he does
not share Sharon's optimism. He sees the new conditions as constraining
for the Palestinians. However, Sharon's plan gives enough room for Abu
Mazen to gain control and concentrate on internal Palestinian affairs
for the next year or two. If terrorism subsides, Abu Mazen will face a
dilemma after completion of the Israeli disengagement: he will probably
demand from Israel and the US to go back to negotiations. Since the main
idea of disengagement is already political, Israel under Sharon will be
reluctant. Abu Mazen's legitimacy will be based on his ability to
deliver at the negotiating table. If this venue is basically closed, he
will lose legitimacy and Palestinian terrorism will resume.

This is where the Labor party differs from Sharon. Labor's entrance into
the government is clearly a limited alignment. Labor sees in
disengagement only the aspects of withdrawal and dismantling of
settlements. But it does not share the strategic principle that
underlies the disengagement plan, and that actually delays the
establishment of a Palestinian state and negates a negotiated peace. The
future of a Likud-Labor partnership largely depends on how far the
unilateral withdrawal goes and how long the process takes. Potentially,
the initial withdrawal from northern Samaria might end up as a long
stretch of land all the way to southern Mount Hebron, leaving in the
hands of the Palestinians all the private lands of the West Bank, while
Israel retains all the state-owned lands.

This process of partitioning the West Bank may take years, but during
that period a long-term partnership between the Likud and the Labor
party might emerge. This may lead both parties, as coalition-partners,
all the way to the next elections in November 2006. Afterwards,
continuation of this new political alliance will depend on the Likud
being able to preserve its current strength in the Knesset, and
continuation of Israel's new unilateral policy might depend on the
Labor-Likud alliance.

Meanwhile, this alliance depends on the current relative strength of
both parties. Paradoxically, if the Likud weakens in the next elections
and Labor regains strength--the Likud will drift rightward and Labor to
the left. Under these circumstances, the Likud loses its current
position as the axis of the political system, and it will inevitably
need the right wing parties to form a government.

Meanwhile, Sharon remains the preferred leader of the Israeli public,
which seems to favor the Likud-Labor alliance. With Sharon in place this
partnership could last for several years.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What did you make of Sharon's Herzliya speech?

A: I think Sharon wanted to send a message to Abu Mazen (Mahmoud
Abbas). At the moment it seems all the doors are open to Abu Mazen from
the international community, and the United States as well as the EU and
Arab countries have offered him their support. I think Sharon was not
happy with this and he wanted to put an end to any dreams Abu Mazen may
harbor. When Abu Mazen was in Lebanon, he was talking about the right of
return and a Palestinian state etc. I think Sharon wanted to send a very
clear message to Abu Mazen that ""you should not dream about all these
issues, the division of Jerusalem, the return of the refugees, a pure
Palestinian state with control over borders"". I think this was the
intent of the speech.

Q: What about the timing?

A: Abu Mazen seems certain to be the next president and he is
working according to this. He has received support from everyone
including from within Fateh. I think he wants to prove that he can keep
to the path of Arafat and the rights of Palestinians and the hope for a
real Palestinian state, so he has repeated this in every Arab capital.
Sharon, who opposes all these issues, wanted to put an end to this talk.

Q: You would have thought that with Abu Mazen talking about
ending the armed uprising, Sharon would want to encourage him?

A: You would have thought. I have heard from Abu Mazen and other
leaders in Fateh, however, including Mohammad Dahlan, that they don't
have faith in getting an agreement with Sharon. I think Abu Mazen has
told Arab leaders that Sharon is not easy to negotiate with, and I don't
think Sharon is interested in encouraging or giving Abu Mazen any
support. I think he is looking to the other side, to the coalition and
his own position as prime minister, to the right wing parties and the
settlers and so on. I don't think he is interested in sending Abu Mazen
any flowers or giving him any encouragement at all.

Q: What about the coalition government? Do you think
bringing Labor into the Israeli government will change anything?

A: First of all, if we look back at the experience of two years
ago when there was a Labor-Likud government, they followed the same
policies, the assassinations, demolishing homes, fighting and destroying
the PA. I don't think it will be different now. Labor is very weak, and
I don't think they have any ability to impact the Likud party. They will
hold no sensitive positions, like defense or foreign affairs. It will be
very difficult for them to change any policies of Sharon, and they will
just provide him support to withdraw from Gaza. Labor will be a slave to
its master, the Likud.

Q: So you see no change on the Israeli side. Where does
that leave the Palestinian side?

A: Well, I don't think the Authority or people in general are
worried about the coalition. We are worried about our own leadership. I
hope Abu Mazen can change the situation here, and forge a new political
strategy, and cooperate with Hamas and other factions. He needs to take
steps first of all to make reform in society, and also to set a clear
political line that does not waver an inch from the Palestinian state on
1967 borders. That will satisfy the factions, Hamas, and the people. The
people want a strong leadership to prevent this right wing Israeli
government from imposing a temporary solution, starting with Gaza and
then postponing other issues for maybe 20 years. Abu Mazen should not be
deceived or trapped by this coalition government in Israel

Q: Are you optimistic that Hamas and Abu Mazen can work
something out?

A: Yes, I think so. I think they are getting closer to each other.
I think Hamas believes Abu Mazen is very straight, he says what he can
or cannot do, and he is open about his thoughts and plans, so I think
there is a good chance for Hamas to cooperate with Abu Mazen and
participate in the PLC election and affect PA decisions and the
political track. This is the time for Hamas to play a big role and exert
influence within the government and the Authority. Abu Mazen cannot do
like Arafat and act freely without responding from pressure from the
inside, the factions and even Fateh.

Q: But how far can such a program go unless there is some
action, or non-action if you like, from the Israelis?

A: We can do things. We can fight corruption. There are many
corrupt people. This can be done away from the bigger political picture.
I heard Abu Mazen yesterday say that we should not blame all our
mistakes on the occupation. We can reform, and we can change the
situation in the PA. This does not mean that the occupation does not
play a big role in the corruption. We cannot impose PA control
everywhere, institutions are destroyed and it's impossible to move
freely. But I think Abu Mazen is determined that he can do something to
change things internally.

Q: How important are Israeli statements that they will move
checkpoints and move out of cities and facilitate elections?

A: I heard [Mustapha] Barghouti speak yesterday, saying he has
moved around and not seen any change. I think the Israelis sometimes use
their presence as occupation forces in the territories to exert
political pressure. I don't think they will move their forces or allow
Palestinians to move freely. I think they want to put a sword at the
neck of Abu Mazen to make their power felt. Maybe for a day or two they
will retreat a little, but after the election everything will go back to
the way it is today.
"
"Isr","Neut","In addressing the future status of the settlements in
Israeli-Palestinian final status arrangements, we first have to ask
whether, considering the terrorist war being waged over the past 16
months, any agreements at all are possible. In view of the Israeli mood,
what are the chances of successful negotiations?

At Camp David II in July 2000, Prime Minister Ehud Barak was prepared to
give up 96 percent of the West Bank and Gaza. It is impossible to
withdraw in this way from nearly all of the territories without
dismantling settlements and removing their residents. At Taba in January
2001, Barak's government increased the offer to 98 percent, along with
part of the Halutza Dunes region inside Israel, with all the
ramifications this precedent carries for future Palestinian demands. Had
Arafat responded with a genuine readiness for peace, the Israeli public
would have been persuaded that this constituted the end of all violent
conflict with the rest of the Arab world as well. A majority would have
supported Barak, even at the cost of a severe internal rift and perhaps
domestic violence.

Arafat responded to Barak's unbelievable concessions by raising a new
and far-reaching demand: the right of return. Arafat knows this demand
is totally unacceptable to the vast majority of Israeli Jews--94
percent, according to one poll. It was here that he revealed his true
face, even to those who still believed him: it is not peace he wants,
but the destruction of the only Jewish state in the world. He proceeded
to follow up with the current campaign of terrorism and attrition. The
reaction of the Israeli public--a sense of betrayal by Arafat and
massive support for Prime Minister Ariel Sharon--needs little elaboration.

Accordingly, it is extremely unlikely that in the near or even
foreseeable future the political status of the settlements will change.
Indeed, they will continue to expand, in land and in population. Just as
it would not cross the mind of any sane Jew to evacuate, say, the
residents of Jericho, so the Arabs (and those Jews who delude the Arabs
into believing that armed struggle will ""break"" the settlements) must
understand that it is no longer possible to evacuate Maale Adumim,
Ariel, Qiryat Arba or Qedumim.

The most important theoreticians and ideologists of the Arab world have
insisted--some still insist--that the State of Israel is a fleeting
episode. Arafat witnessed Israel's hasty withdrawal from Lebanon and
yielded to the temptation to believe that it would behave similarly in
Judea and Samaria. If there is one single Israeli community that has
proven how wrong he was, and that provides the vanguard for the strong
stance of the entire Israeli people, it is the settlers. The Arab world
insists blindly on misreading the substance and true motivation of the
settlers--the historic, Zionist, religious and national ethos that
drives the majority of the settler community.

The settlements, like any living organism, continue to develop and grow.
Last year, despite terrorist attacks on the roads that killed more than
100 men, women and children, the settler population grew by 5.7 percent
(compared to 2.7 percent among Israelis as a whole, including immigrant
absorption, and 10 percent among settlers in a ""normal"" year).

In the first Intifada, despite casualties from stones and firebombs, the
Jewish community in Judea, Samaria and Gaza tripled in size: from about
50,000 to around 150,000. Today there are some 220,000 settlers. The
Palestinians chose then, as now, to believe the claims of their
supporters from the Israeli extreme left, that the settlers came to
improve their quality of life and that consequently a war of attrition
like that waged over the past 16 months would cause them to flee.

Here too they are wrong. If Maale Adumim and Ariel, for example, have
turned into vibrant cities that attract new (and primarily
non-religious) settlers, this puts the lie to that argument. Even as
Israelis continue to debate ""concessions"" for peace, additional
settlements like Beitar and Alfei Menashe will reach populations of
15,000 and achieve recognized urban status; the territories will
comprise 4-6 Jewish cities of over 30,000 residents each, some 50
communities of over 5,000 Jews, and around 90 additional communities,
many of them with a population of over 1,000. Does anyone really believe
that, even if the leftist Meretz Party takes power in Israel, it will be
possible to dislodge a population this size? Yet these are the numbers
of settlers that will inhabit the settlements, despite Palestinian
opposition, within a few years.

I do not know precisely what the political status of the settlements
will be in any possible future agreement. One thing is clear: whatever
agreement is reached, no one will remove us by force. Nor can anyone
stop the growth of the settlements in terms of their size and
population. Thus there is wisdom in the assertion that, at least in
these territories, a Palestinian state cannot be established with enough
land to sustain a population the size of that within the Palestinian
Authority, where 96 percent of the Palestinians live in areas A and B. I
believe it is already too late for this to happen. Hence a future
solution will have to draw upon the contribution of additional states,
Jordan and Egypt, to a territorial solution for a Palestinian state.

But this is the topic of another essay.
"
"Pal","Neut","There is no way to describe the presence of Israeli settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip and their ongoing growth except as a
government-supported process of colonizing Palestinian land. These
settlements have a daily impact upon the standard of living of the
average Palestinian, besides their detrimental impact upon
Israeli-Palestinian talks over a future resolution to the conflict.

There are 352 Israeli controlled areas in the West Bank alone. These
include 175 Israeli colonies, 61 military bases, 50 facility sites
(water tanks, gas stations, etc.) and 59 ""outposts."" Since the Israeli
elections in February of 2001 when Arial Sharon was elected prime
minister, 19 new outposts have been erected in the West Bank. These
Israeli-controlled areas occupy 2.4 percent of the West Bank (not
including the agricultural land under Israeli control in the Jordan
Valley) according to spot images taken in 2000. That may not sound like
a great deal, until one understands that Palestinian built-up areas
occupy only 9.4 percent of the West Bank.

The settlers are consolidated in areas and population concentrations
that form a real obstacle to peace. The number of Israeli settlers in
the West Bank exceeds 400,000 people, including the settlers of East
Jerusalem. The majority of those settlers (75.5 percent) reside in
colonies with a population over 5,000. These colonies are located in the
central part of the West Bank near Jerusalem and in the northern part of
the West Bank, near Salfit. Over 14 percent of the settlers live in
colonies of between 1,000 and 5,000 people and are located in the middle
and northern parts of the West Bank. The rest of the settlers, some 10
percent, reside in colonies scattered all over the West Bank with
populations of less than 1,000.

In Gaza, the areas controlled by Israel make up 15 percent of the land,
and the existing colonies occupy 4.9 percent of that land.

Further, these colonies persist due to the systematic financial support
given them by the Israeli government. For the year 2001, a staggering
$350 million was allocated to the colonies in the Knesset budget
proposal. Nearly ninety percent of the settlers and 86 percent of the
colonies are designated as ""national priority A,"" which gifts them with
a formidable incentives package. These benefits include a 7 percent
income tax break, housing grants, subsidized mortgages, free schooling
from age three, free school busing, and grants for business industry,
agriculture and tourism.

As such, the Israeli government's protestations that the settlements
must be allowed ""natural growth"" is only a politically expedient term
created by Israel to disguise its efforts to ""thicken"" and expand the
settlements. Consider this: 60 percent of Israeli construction in the
Occupied Palestinian Territories is state-funded, compared with 25
percent within Israel. The rate of growth in the Territories is
estimated at between eight and ten percent, while the rate of growth in
Israel is two to three percent, according to Peace Now. Therefore, it is
the government that is promoting the growth of the settlements, despite
that reliable sources assure us that many housing units in the
Territories remain empty today.

The results are devastating to both Palestinian national interests and
the individual Palestinian. Three Israeli colony blocks--located in the
mid-north, central and mid-south--of the West Bank, taken along with the
by-pass roads that extend from them to the east, slice through the West
Bank from the east to the west. A series of colonies and military bases
in the Jordan Valley act as a physical barrier to Palestinians from the
eastern border. Several colony clusters are located very close to (if
not on) the Green Line (the boundary between Israel and the West Bank)
in a clear attempt to redraw the Green line in Israel's favor. Many of
these then have ""twin towns"" on the western or Israeli side of the Green
Line. A good example of that attempt to consolidate land is the
positioning of Modiin town next to Kiryat Sefer colony.

The colonies also surround Palestinian areas, with more than 200
Palestinian towns and villages lying 500 meters or less away from
Israeli-controlled areas. Twenty-four of these colonies are located on
highly sensitive agricultural land and 128 colonies are located on
moderately sensitive agricultural land. In the West Bank, 115 colonies
are located in highly sensitive water recharge areas, 25 on sensitive
water discharge areas and 17 on moderately sensitive water discharge
areas. The results can be seen in the much higher Israeli water
consumption and standard of. Israeli daily individual consumption of
water in these colonies is ten times greater than that of
Palestinians.
"
"Isr","Neut","The idea of devoting an article to the outposts provokes a principled
objection. After all, what is the point of distinguishing between a
discussion of outposts and a discussion of the entire settlement
enterprise? Clearly the outposts are nothing less than new or expanded
settlements, established in recent years.

In this sense, institutionalizing the ""outposts issue"" as a separate
topic for discussion is simply one more expression of the success of the
settler right wing in normalizing a prolonged situation in which the
lives of hundreds of thousands of Israelis are lived beyond the state's
sovereign borders, in an area where for generations there has lived
another population devoid of basic rights. Moreover, the mere fact of a
separate discussion of the outposts serves the settlers as an additional
line of defense: anyone who tries to breach it, in the process causing
political and media casualties, will wake up one day to discover that
the ""legal settlements"" have in the interim tripled and quadrupled in size.

Sound familiar? This in brief is the story of Israeli settlement in the
West Bank over the past ten years.

Here is an example that clearly illustrates the phenomenon. Migron
(about 40 families), HaRoeh (some 15 families) and Havat Gilad (three
families plus a varying number of disturbed youth) are three out of
about 100 outposts scattered around the West Bank whose names come up
every few months when an attempt--usually abortive--is made to remove a
chicken coop or container that was smuggled into them in the dead of night.

Does any serious person with even the slightest knowledge of the network
of settlements that slices the West Bank into tens of separate enclaves,
believe for a minute that the presence of at most 250 Israelis (most of
them infants and children) living in these three settlements in any way
alters the future of Israeli control over the West Bank? The periodic
discussion concerning these or other outposts constitutes precisely that
wall of consciousness and media that the settlers exploit in order to
divert the discussion away from the real questions that Israeli society
must urgently address.

Were a serious discussion ever enjoined regarding the future of the West
Bank and the settlements, the alternative names that would come up would
be those of the three settlements that those three outposts abut: Kochav
Yaakov (about 4,000 people), Eli (some 2,200) and Qadumim (around 3,000
persons). In all three of these settlements, the population has doubled
or tripled in the past decade. Such a discussion would oblige Israeli
society first and foremost to recognize and internalize two simple facts
of life.

First, that two separate peoples, Jewish Israelis and Palestinian Arabs,
live in this land. And second, that it is impossible for the fate of one
of the two peoples to be determined for a prolonged period of time
arbitrarily by the other--precisely the political program the
settlements and outposts were established to implement.

Nevertheless, an historic discussion of the settlements does seem to
spotlight one unique aspect of the outposts--more precisely of some of
the outposts, particularly those established in recent years--that
differs from the overall story of the settlement enterprise.

The establishment of some of the outposts reflects an evolutionary stage
whereby the very strength of the political and bureaucratic
establishment created to serve the settlements began to generate antibodies.

This is the stage when the central Israeli government lost control not
only over the behavior of the settlers but also over the disposition of
the huge resources that the state put at their disposal. Thus there has
evolved a distorted reality in which the heads of the West Bank
settlers' regional councils, who were chosen to collect land taxes in
order to repair roads and sidewalks, have ended up formulating Israel's
foreign and security policies.

Perhaps in a generation or two, when historical perspective allows for
it, someone will write a comprehensive treatise that attempts to sum up
the West Bank settlement enterprise. A quick perusal of the book's index
of names and concepts will likely note that the name Ariel Sharon has
the most references, followed by concepts like ""folly"", ""evil"" and
perhaps ""naivete"" as well.

And, of course, the term ""irony"".
"
"Pal","Neut","Saeed Talib is an American citizen and a West Bank farmer. Neither is
standing him in good stead at the moment. He has not been able to tend
to his land in the village of Turmus Ayya on the road north to Nablus
for four years, and he is afforded no legal recourse from any quarter.

Some six years ago, a settlement outpost was established near the
village. The settler who first drove up his caravan on an empty hilltop
has since become notorious. All the villagers know him as Boaz. He is no
longer alone.

Now, some 50 caravans stand beside his. According to Israeli law, these
settlement outposts are illegal. But the Israeli government has
nevertheless provided them with paved roads, electricity and running water.

Saeed and his fellow villagers have been allowed onto their land for
only a few days a year since the intifada began. These are during the
October-November olive harvest season. The farmers are desperate. Two
days a year, only to harvest, is neither here nor there. For the rest of
the year they are prevented from tending their land, from planting
seedlings or from weeding and trimming.

Before the intifada, farmers used to defy the settlers. There were many
confrontations and arguments. Just before the intifada broke out, Boaz
awoke to find his herd of sheep gone and his dogs dead.

He strolled into another nearby village al-Mughayyer, and hung up
leaflets in Hebrew. The leaflets warned the villagers that if he was not
compensated $1,500 per dog and his sheep were not returned within 24
hours, he, Boaz, would cut down 700 trees. No money and no sheep were
forthcoming. The next day, Boaz returned with an armed gang and in the
presence of the Israeli army cut down 700 trees. Months later, villagers
reported that his sheep had been found in the Jordan Valley, and his
purpose had been to claim compensation.

The violence doesn't stop. On the outskirts of another nearby village,
Sinjel, settlers from Ma'ale Levona erected caravans the Israeli
government now describes as ""semi-illegal"", or ""scheduled to become
legal"". These settlers' wont is to burn down wheat fields every summer.
Last summer 50 dunams were thus laid to waste before the villagers could
put out the fire. To protect these settlers, the Israeli army built a
camp next to the outpost. Every one knows that one day, that camp will
be filled with more settlers.

During the intifada, confronting the settlers has become far too
dangerous for the farmers. There is little direct contact. Villagers
have been warned to stay at a distance of 1,000 to 1,500 meters from the
""borders"" of any settlement or outpost. Any closer and they are shot at,
sometimes wounded and sometimes killed. The settlers are above the law.
People are shot, their fields are burned and their machinery or houses
damaged. The settler is the king of the West Bank.

When Saeed went to harvest olives on the two days he was allowed onto
his land he was shot at. His car was burned. Settlers came to chase him
away. He told them he would call the police. One shouted back at him:
""I'll give you my number. I am the police. I am the army."" The settler
is king.

According to international law, all settlements are illegal. According
to Israeli law, the outposts, established without prior planning with
the Israeli army, are illegal. This illegality, however, has become a
means for the army to avoid confronting outpost settlers. They simply
don't apply the law.

Outposts have a habit of multiplying and expanding. They have a habit of
becoming permanent. They are the biggest provocation faced by ordinary
people on the ground. On the same day as the signing of the Oslo
Accords, a concerted Israeli drive to multiply settlements and outposts
in the West Bank in particular was set in motion. The number of settlers
doubled between 1993 and 2000. The signal to the average Palestinian was
unmistakable. While Israeli officials smiled on TV they took more land
on the ground.

At a time of some confidence between the two sides, it took a while
before this obvious transgression of the spirit if not the letter of the
Oslo Accords was translated into direct anger.

Now, after the latest intifada, very much sparked by anger at the
continued settlement expansions and the flourishing of settlement
outposts, there is no confidence. If Israel wants to persuade any
Palestinian that it is serious about peace, that it is serious about two
states, then these outposts must be removed. People no longer believe
fine words. People want results on the ground.

I am not hopeful. In the West Bank, the settler remains king.
"
"Isr","Neut","The separation fence is today at the center of public debate. Ultimately
it will constitute a physical barrier between us and the Palestinians.
Many people are in favor of its construction. The terrorist acts of
recent years inside the green line generated an understanding among
ourselves and the Palestinians that even if the two peoples are destined
one day to live peacefully side by side--for the present they have to
separate.

The debate that produces almost daily protests, demonstrations,
disturbances, violent attacks, and appeals to the High Court of Justice
is not about the necessity for the barrier--but rather its location. In
many instances the barrier creates gross injustices and humanitarian and
economic problems. It separates people from their land and source of
income, families from their communities, students from their
institutions of learning, the ill from their physicians, entire
populations from the center of their lives. But when we speak of the
barrier in Jerusalem, what is called the Jerusalem envelope, we
encounter all these dilemmas and something else: stupidity.

In June 1967, shortly after the Six-Day War, the Government of Israel
decided to expand the borders of Jerusalem. A small city encompassing 38
square kilometers all told became a large metropolis of 108 sq. km.
Overnight Jerusalem became the biggest city in Israel in terms of both
expanse and population.

Then in the early 1970s, the government added two important decisions.
One was to build new neighborhoods in the annexed parts of the city and
encourage Jews from around the country and the world to establish their
homes there. The second was a directive to municipal planners to design
their long-term plans so as to maintain the 1967 demographic ratio
within the city of 74.2 percent Jews and 25.8 percent Arabs (figures
from the Jerusalem Institute of Israel Studies). This directive
constituted a green light for the planning and building authorities,
Jerusalem Municipality, and Ministry of Interior to limit construction
plans for Jerusalem Arabs and to reduce, to the greatest extent
possible, the areas allotted for building.

One of the default options left open to Jerusalem Arabs was to build
their homes outside the new city limits, but close enough so that
Jerusalem would continue to constitute the center of their lives.
Thousands of Palestinian families were pushed toward this option and
built their homes outside the city limits, but only a few minutes' drive
from its center. Indeed the Ministry of Housing, in close cooperation
with the Jerusalem Municipality and with the aid of mortgages from the
Bank of Jerusalem, offered Jerusalem Arabs an additional incentive--an
offer they could not refuse: buy a new home in al Azaria next to
Jerusalem and enhance your standard of living.

Jerusalem Arabs who seized this opportunity were reassured by the
Ministry and the Municipality that none of their privileges as residents
of the State of Israel--social security allowances, health insurance,
Israeli ID, etc.--would in any way be curtailed. So successful was the
scheme that a second, ""build your own house"" phase was declared in al
Azaria. Once again the issue of residents' rights was raised, and once
again assurances were provided that all residency privileges would be
maintained. So again many hurried to exploit the mortgage bargains being
offered by the bank, purchased lots, and built new homes.

To this day, thousands of Palestinian families have left Jerusalem in
this way at their own initiative. To a large extent, the Israeli
authorities have remained faithful to their commitment not to detract
from the rights of East Jerusalem Arabs who moved their dwellings to
parts of the West Bank adjacent to Jerusalem, even though according to
the letter of the law, these families (residents but not citizens of
Israel, whose lives still focus on Jerusalem) have left Israel and no
longer enjoy the same privileges as the rest of Israel's residents.

Here we come to the separation fence. The barrier, currently being
constructed energetically, will create a sad new reality. Thousands of
Palestinian families whose lives center on Jerusalem but who built homes
beyond the municipal borders will now find themselves cut off from the
city. The merchant whose business is in East Jerusalem, the clerk or
social worker employed by the Municipality, the children who study at
schools run by the Municipality and Ministry of Education, the employee
of a Jerusalem Arab or Jewish business--all are Jerusalem residents, all
continue to pay their taxes and social security charges to the Israeli
authorities and to receive social security pensions, and all will
discover that they have in effect left Jerusalem permanently and are
completely cut off from the center of their lives.

Thus far the injustice. Where is the stupidity? We have noted that the
government of Israel wanted to preserve the same demographic ratio
between Jews and Arabs as in 1967 and instructed its planners
accordingly. Now, as a consequence of the physical barrier going up
between Jerusalem and the adjacent West Bank neighborhoods, thousands of
Palestinian families that live outside the city in nearby suburbs are
beginning to return to the city. Since Jerusalem cannot satisfy all
their housing needs, they will live in poor and crowded conditions--so
long as they can live in Jerusalem.

And what has happened to the demographic ratio? The Israeli government's
dream of maintaining the 1967 proportion between Jews and Arabs is no
longer valid. The ratio is changing. The government, which wanted a
solid Jewish majority in the city, is liable to wake up to a very
different reality.
"
"Pal","Neut","Israel's wall in East Jerusalem slices through Palestinian communities
and Palestinian lives like a dagger.

Since 1967, Israeli policy in East Jerusalem has been designed to
encourage Jewish Israeli settlement and to decrease the number of
Palestinian residents through a series of punitive building and
residency laws that are only applied to non-Jews. The wall excises
Palestinian communities from the landscape of East Jerusalem, containing
them in isolated, disconnected ghettos.

By the time the Jerusalem wall is completed, more than 90 percent of the
East Jerusalem district will be absorbed by Israel. About 250,000
Palestinians will be stranded in walled enclosures and cut off from both
East Jerusalem and other urban centers. They will lose access to
schools, universities, medical facilities, the Haram al-Sharif and
Church of the Holy Sepulchre--and each other.

The 15,000 Jerusalem residents who live in Qalandia and Kufr Aqab, which
are north of the wall, are likely to lose their Jerusalem residency
rights altogether. To the northwest, the wall imprisons Bir Nabala,
Judeira, Jib, and the old city of Beit Hanina (combined population
14,000). The southern part of the wall cuts off Bethlehem, Beit Sahour,
Beit Jala, and their refugee camps (comb. pop. 170,000) from East
Jerusalem and from the central and northern West Bank. It also imprisons
the 1,600 residents of Walaja.

Since 1967, the stated policy of the Jerusalem Municipality has been to
create a ratio of 78 Jews for every 28 Palestinians. So the Municipality
confiscated land from Palestinians and made it available only to Jews,
revoked the residency rights of Palestinians (but not Jews) and required
that they continually prove their rights, denied building permits only
to Palestinian residents, and demolished illegally built Palestinian
homes. The Jerusalem wall ratchets up this policy by carving Palestinian
communities out of East Jerusalem and making it impossible for people to
conduct the activities of everyday life.

Palestinians in the town of al Ram between East Jerusalem and Ramallah
(and east of the wall) will lose their livelihoods as the result of the
wall. Al Ram's population grew to 60,000 with the influx of Jerusalem
residents who were unable to build homes in East Jerusalem. It became a
lively hub of transportation between the two larger cities. Now,
however, the wall slices through al Ram and encircles most of the town,
killing work opportunities.

More fundamentally, the wall creates a labyrinthine maze residents must
negotiate to cross even trivial distances. In August 2003, I met Fatima
Assad, a schoolteacher who lives in Qalandia and works in East
Jerusalem, who told me how the fragment of the wall that was in place
when we met changed her seven kilometer commute into a two to three hour
daily ordeal, much of it spent on foot.

It is a scene that is becoming all too familiar throughout the occupied
territories. If the wall is completed as planned, 43.5% of the West Bank
will be annexed to Israel. When one considers the implications of the
wall in the context of the network of bypass roads (for Israeli settlers
only), access roads (restricting entry to Palestinian towns to one or
two gated roads that are locked overnight), and more than 480
checkpoints that make travel between Palestinian towns nearly
impossible, it becomes clear that the West Bank has been divided into
impoverished cantons subdivided into ghettos. This can only be described
as a policy of ethnic cleansing.

The course of the wall was defined, not to prevent suicide bombings (an
argument that would have been hard to refute had the wall been built on
the green line) but rather to inflict the maximum amount of damage on
Palestinian society. The wall implements what Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon stated (as reported by /The Times/ on August 24, 1988) as his
preference: ""You don't simply bundle people onto trucks and drive them
away. . . . I prefer to advocate a positive policy, to create, in
effect, a condition that in a positive way will induce people to leave.""

What legitimate security needs are met by Israel's demand that
Palestinians in the ""seam area"" (that is, those who find themselves west
of the wall) secure permits from Israeli military authorities simply to
live in their own homes? If Israeli security is the issue, what is the
justification for separating Palestinian communities from each other?
How are Israelis more secure when the 40,000 residents of Qalqilya,
surrounded on all sides by an eight meter high wall, are denied a view
of the sunset?

The Israeli political establishment seems to believe that if it stomps
long and hard enough on the Palestinians, they will forego their
national and political rights. So Israel bulldozed Jenin and Nablus and
more recently Rafah. This policy is sterile and ultimately will fail.
How much longer will the Israeli public and Israel's supporters abroad
accept Israel's predatory definition of its security needs?

My main concern is how much longer Palestinians will have to spend their
time, energies, and creativity just finding ways to survive and maintain
their sense of dignity in the face of Israel's relentless attacks. No
people should be so cruelly tested.
"
"Isr","Neut","""There are no sacred dates,"" declared the late Yitzhak Rabin. To the
extent that it is up to them, it appears that Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen)
happily embrace this insight.

More than two months after Israel and the Palestinian Authority accepted
the Bush administration's roadmap
                                                , things are moving
slowly. Both sides are dragging their feet along the path charted by the
experts in Washington, each constantly eyeing the other to make sure it
is not lingering too far back. And since the Americans are in any case
preoccupied with an escalating dilemma in Iraq, the chances are slim
that a genuine effort will be made in the near term to actually compel
Israel and the Palestinians to obey the administration's detailed
instructions quickly and completely.

What has been achieved thus far should not be taken lightly. June 2003
is to date the quietest month since the second intifada began;
incitement in the Palestinian media has almost stopped; and Israel has
evacuated parts of the Gaza Strip and the Bethlehem area. But a measured
examination of the main components of phase I of the roadmap indicates
that it is still early even to give the two sides a passing grade.

/Security./ The biggest success of the process is without doubt the
declaration of a ceasefire or hudna--which officially is not even part
of the process. Terrorist attacks this month have killed three Israelis,
but in general the ceasefire is being maintained. Order has been
restored to most regions, and the daily rate of live fire incidents has
dropped by more than half, to between two and five. Those attacks that
have taken place were perpetrated by what the Israel Defense Forces
(IDF) Intelligence Directorate calls ""Fateh dissidents"", members of
local Tanzim gangs in the northern West Bank, a rebellious Islamic Jihad
cell in Jenin and members of the ""popular resistance committees"" who
abandoned Fateh in the southern Gaza Strip. There the Palestinian
Authority (PA) is hesitant to use force as long as the West Bank is
still largely under Israeli security responsibility; senior Fateh
officials argue that a cessation of IDF roundups of suspects there would
reduce the rebels' concern for their personal security and culminate in
a reduction in attacks.

But the more significant issue involves the dismantling of the terrorist
organizations' infrastructure. Here the PA has done nearly nothing.
Instead of arrests, terrorist militants were summoned to ""warning
talks,"" even as the PA clarified that it had no intention of settling
accounts with suspects regarding past attacks. The diverse organizations
are permitted for the time being to hold onto their weapons, while the
commitment to unify the security branches into three roof organizations,
all under Abu Mazen's authority, has encountered, as anticipated, strong
resistance on the part of Yasir Arafat, to whom at least half the
security units continue to report.

/The humanitarian situation./ Accordingly, Israel too is delaying
implementation of its commitments. In the Gaza Strip, soldiers'
open-fire orders have been restricted and the trip from Gaza City to
Rafah has been reduced from 5-6 hours to 20 minutes. But in most areas
of the West Bank nothing has changed. Most Palestinian cities remain
surrounded, entrances to villages are blockaded and road travel is
forbidden. Only some 20,000 Palestinians (mostly the fortunate from the
Gaza Strip and Bethlehem) are permitted to work in Israel. For the time
being Israel is delaying any discussion of additional withdrawals to the
September 28, 2000 lines. And without such withdrawals the living
conditions for around half the Palestinians are simply impossible.

/Prisoner release./ While this issue is not included in the roadmap, it
is the most substantive of all for Palestinians. At this point Israel is
prepared to release only some 350 out of around 6,000 prisoners it
holds. Sharon, under American pressure, agreed to include a few dozen
Hamas and Islamic Jihad detainees who have no ""blood on their hands.""
Without a more massive release it is doubtful whether it will be
possible to gain the Palestinian public's support for the process.

/Outposts./ Israel's performance on this issue borders on the
ridiculous. One outpost, Mitzpe Yitzhar, was evacuated despite a
confrontation between the IDF and the settlers, and around five were
evacuated by agreement--while more than ten new outposts have been
established in their place. The government shied away from touching
dozens of additional outposts, and probably won't in the future either.

In briefing talks with IDF officers, Chief of Staff Moshe Yaalon has
advocated following two rules in ongoing contacts with the PA:
meticulous insistence on the Palestinians maintaining their security
commitments, alongside a display of generosity and even calculated risks
with regard to enhancing living conditions for Palestinians. Of these
two rules, the Israeli political echelon appears to have opted to adopt
only the first.

In the coming months the roadmap will face its real test: the
dismantling of terrorist infrastructure by the PA, and ongoing IDF
redeployments from designated areas. Success in these two parameters is
likely to produce a half-year extension of the ceasefire. Meanwhile,
while it is too early to conclude that the American initiative has
failed, it is still held hostage by too many lunatic elements. It has
not yet developed an internal logic of its own that can edge the two
sides forward. The main problems are trust in the other side's
intentions--which has almost disappeared--and of course the gaps
separating the two sides' positions regarding final status issues (the
future of the settlements, Jerusalem, the right of return). At least
under the present leaders these appear unbridgeable.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: How would Hamas assess the progress and advantages of
the ceasefire at this time?

A: Up to this moment, Israel has violated all of the conditions
of the ceasefire, continuing with its killing, its demolition of houses
and refusing to release the prisoners. Still, the Palestinian people
remain committed to the ceasefire one hundred percent. We are watching
the Israeli side, recording what the Israelis are saying and doing, and
if it becomes necessary, we will return to an effective armed struggle.

Q: Under what conditions will the ceasefire be discontinued?

A: First, there is the three-month deadline, which we are
sticking to. Second, if Israel were to carry out a massive violation,
such as an invasion or dramatic killing, then we would have to consider
ending the ceasefire.

Q: Do you maintain the public's support in this?

A: We have the public's support; we even maintain the support of
the international community. The European Union has even decided not to
consider Hamas a terrorist organization.

Q: How would you assess the government of Prime Minister
Mahmoud Abbas and the progress on the roadmap
                                                ?

A: As of yet, this Palestinian government has been unable to
achieve the base demands of Palestinians. This government is working
hard, but has nothing to show for it yet. To my mind, if Mahmoud Abbas
can't produce the basic requirements demanded by the Palestinian people,
he will resign.

Q: Why is the prisoner issue so important, even though it
is not a part of the roadmap?

A: This is one of the tender points in Palestinian society. Since
this Israeli government has taken office, it has slowly deprived as many
as 70 basic rights from the prisoners. They are not allowed visits from
their families and lawyers, they live off of the food given them by
their families, and their clothes are those that their families have
sent for them. They have been prevented from living as human beings.
Therefore, the release of these prisoners is one of the most important
demands of the Palestinian people.

Israel has said that it will release some prisoners, but we will not be
deceived. We have lists and we are ready to give the names of those we
want released. We will not be tricked. If the Israeli government is
going to mislead us on this issue, the response will be a violent one
and we will return to the effective armed struggle.

Q: Does Hamas ever imagine a time when it will be in the
Palestinian government and the only parties carrying weapons on
Palestinian streets will be the Palestinian police?

A: Yes, when our land is liberated. When we achieve sovereignty,
we will demand free elections. If the Palestinian people vote for Hamas
in the elections, then we will be in the government--not in an
autonomy--but in a sovereign Palestinian state. At that time, the
Palestinian army will carry guns and will defend the Palestinian
borders, not like now where the Palestinian police are expected to spy
on their own people for Israel.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: How do you view the constraints that the United States is
trying to place on Israel's freedom of action during the countdown to
its invasion of Iraq and during the war there? How will the radical
actors in the region react?

A: Prior to the operation, the Americans want to be allowed to build
an international consensus, to pass resolutions in Congress and the
Security Council. They need peace and quiet. Thus it's easy to
understand how any incident that disturbs the peace annoys them. If and
when they begin the operation, well, the dice are cast and the situation
changes. It will be hard for anyone on the outside to disturb them.
Since this time, unlike in '91, there is no coalition with the Arabs,
extremist elements cannot disrupt it. Accordingly an operation by, say,
Hizballah in the north during the war will not go without a response.

Q: Yet Israel exercised restraint and did not respond to
Lebanon's pumping of water from the sources of the Jordan River.

A: Regarding water, Israel appears to have shown restraint without
any American demand, due to considerations of its own. But clearly we
are not ignoring this; whether we respond during the American operation
in Iraq or after it is a tactical issue. In any event, in '91 everything
was quiet in our region during the war in Iraq, and I'm inclined to
believe that this time we'll see a repeat performance. The extremists
will understand that this is war, and ""a la guerre comme a la guerre;""
they won't be disruptive.

Q: In your assessment, will the US succeed in its war against
Iraq? And if so, how will it act in our region after victory?

A: I find it hard to imagine an American failure. In the event of
victory, the probably scenario is that the administration will not seek
to force a solution on us. It sees in Israel a long-term ally. Everyone
will line up with the Americans except anomalies like Hizballah and
Hamas; everyone will understand that we have reached the end of
extremism. Predictions of loss of control and anarchy in the region are
not realistic. We already see a change in the American attitude toward
the legitimacy of the Arab regimes. The regimes and leaders will change.

This development already applies to Arafat. He's on the way out. If the
Americans succeed in Iraq the Palestinians will recognize the change and
remove him. There are already Palestinians who demand to change course;
a successful American operation in Iraq will amplify those voices. After
the war we'll witness a gradual Palestinian moderation, moving toward an
accommodation, in the sense of institutionalization of relations and
coexistence.

Q: Will removal of Saddam Hussein end the Intifada?

A: I'd be surprised if it brought about an end to Palestinian
frustrations and the Intifada. If the Americans succeed in Iraq and a
liberal, democratic regime emerges, this will affect the Palestinian
leadership and temper the conflict. But I don't see a direct connection
between American success in Iraq and the problems that constitute the
root cause of the war being waged here for two years.

Q: The Americans presented Prime Minister Sharon in
Washington with a ""road map"" for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement
within 3 to 4 years. They are also working within the ""Quartet"" to
coordinate a solution. Some speculate that they'll try to impose a
solution after Iraq.

A: The Americans may indeed devote more time to dealing with our
conflict. But some parties have illusions regarding what we can expect
in Israeli-American relations after the operation in Iraq. I don't
anticipate brutal pressure. Within the Quartet, the American attitude
toward us does not resemble that of the other members, such as the
European Union, which is fairly hostile toward us. Within the
administration there is now broad agreement regarding the way to deal
with Iraq, including Secretary of State Powell; this is not the case
regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict following the Iraq operation,
because it is still beyond the horizon.

Q: Do you think the US has formulated a model solution to our
conflict following the war in Iraq?

A: Right now we are hearing from President Bush about those areas
where it appears to him there is a common denominator, such as a
Palestinian state and ceasing settlement expansion. But there's a
difference between the fairly obvious things he says today and what
he'll present after the prime minister of Israel explains the dangers to
him. At least regarding this administration it is an illusion to think
that following the operation in Iraq it will appear as a neutral arbiter
between Israel and the Palestinians.
"
"Pal","Neut","The United States administration is clearly determined to strike Iraq,
and current diplomatic efforts to garner a new Security Council
resolution are merely part of a continued attempt to mobilize the widest
possible base of support. Washington has issued strong statements that
confirm the United States' readiness to act alone against Iraq, but
other voices in Washington warn of the consequences that could follow
hasty and unilateral moves. These voices are calling on the US
administration to exert every conceivable effort to form an alliance.

Many Arab countries with close relations to the United States are now
torn between American pressures demanding that they join the alliance
and their constituencies' opposition to the United States waging a war
on Iraq. These countries find the United Nations' resolution a way out
of this dilemma because it offers them an excuse not to openly oppose
the American strike, and even provides justification for participating
in the strike to an extent. The United States clearly wants to secure
this kind of official Arab position, as it would eliminate many of the
difficulties the US is now facing.

In order to overcome the obstacles of winning over the Arabs on Iraq,
America is now concerned with calming the situation in Palestine. A
continuation of Israeli escalations against the Palestinian people
during a strike on Iraq would provoke segments of the Arab masses while
jeopardizing Arab leaderships and complicating the position of the
United States. Therefore, the United States administration has recently
undertaken two preparatory steps.

The first step was to invite Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to
Washington and ask him to calm the situation by loosening the
stranglehold on Palestinians to an extent that does not compromise
Israeli security considerations. But due to the total harmony in the
strategic visions of US President George W. Bush and Sharon regarding
the Palestinian leadership, the US request is purely tactical and does
not extend to the Palestinian president.

The second step was to disclose the ""road map"" for ending the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict in line with Bush's three-year vision for
the establishment of a Palestinian state capable of existing alongside
Israel. In a move all too typical of times when the US needs something,
Undersecretary of State William Burns was sent to the region to throw
dust in the eyes of the Arabs. This is an attempt to show that the
Palestinian issue has not been forgotten and that constructive plans
will be set into motion at the first opportunity.

Sharon does not see eye to eye with Bush's vision for the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict because he is absolutely opposed to the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state west of the Jordan
River. According to Sharon's ideological vision, the area west of the
river is ""the land of Israel"" and must not be shared or split with any
other party. Bush's vision for the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state will therefore go nowhere with Sharon.

But this Israeli ""bulldozer"" learned a valuable lesson from former Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's confrontation with Bush Sr. when they headed
their respective governments. Sharon doesn't want to repeat this costly
public confrontation. That does not mean, however, that Sharon will bow
to Bush Jr.'s vision. Instead, he will thwart its implementation through
indirect methods.

Sharon will promise President Bush to calm the situation on the
Palestinian front (because he wants the advantages of the Iraqi strike)
and will undertake superficial measures such as releasing portions of
the frozen Authority funds, removing some scattered and uninhabited
settlement caravans and redeploying the army from cities that have been
reoccupied.

In the coming period, however, he will also do all he can in a
circuitous manner to incite the Palestinians with the aim of provoking a
violent response--such as a series of suicide bombings within the Green
Line--that he can use as an excuse to irreparably terminate the
Palestinian national project. In short, he will try to exploit every
opportunity provided by the anticipated war on Iraq to preclude any
success of Bush's vision for ending the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

In doing this, however, Sharon will avoid an open and public
confrontation with the American administration. He is not able to
implicitly undertake what he and increasing numbers of Israelis want: a
mass transfer campaign to expel large numbers of Palestinians from the
country. If calming the situation in Palestine is a US prerogative
during its war on Iraq, a large-scale Israeli campaign to transfer
Palestinians would stymie this US goal, while lighting the fuse of the
entire Arab region and spurring disasters throughout the international
arena that have extremely serious ramifications.

It is worth noting, however, that the absence of the opportunity to
implement a mass transfer of Palestinians does not mean that Sharon will
not attempt to exploit the circumstances to implement internal transfer
of Palestinians. The goal of this would be to tighten the siege around
them in separated cantons. After all, the struggle between Palestinians
and Israelis is over gaining control of the largest area of Palestine
while decreasing the presence of the other.

The Palestinians do not have many choices in the upcoming months other
than to practice the highest degree of self-control possible,
particularly in terms of halting suicide bombings inside the Green Line
and strengthening their ability to stand fast until the storm passes.
These are not simple matters; on the contrary, they are extremely
difficult. The internal Palestinian situation continues to suffer from
numerous internal splintering, on the one hand, and from the weakening
of the Palestinian Authority on the other. This in turn opens the way
for internal disputes regarding suicide operations within the Green
Line. In order to strengthen the Palestinians' ability to withstand
Israeli aggression, there must be both material resources and public
trust in the Authority. Both of these essential ingredients are now
missing, and the situation is further exacerbated by the fact that
removing Arafat remains a strategic demand of Israel and the US.

Burns' visit will not result in any practical steps, and in the coming
months the Palestinian situation will be forgotten again, shifting in
its importance until the post-strike situation in Iraq becomes clear. No
significant political moves will be taken before next summer, by the
most conservative estimates. And when they happen, there isn't any
guarantee that those moves will be in the Palestinian favor.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: Can humanitarian aid bring peace or maintain the peace
process?

A: Aid alone cannot maintain the process. But it can and does
grease the wheels of peace.

Q: Some in Israel and the international community argue
that the provision of international humanitarian aid to the Palestinian
population actually prolongs the conflict.

A: Aid does not prolong this conflict. It is the right thing to
do. International aid began with the occupation back in the 1960s, and
it was justified then as now. The aid organizations did good work in the
field. They recruited local resources in the areas of education and
development and played an important role in the well being of the
population.

Q: How does Israel's Civil Administration fit into this
scheme?

A: It assists the dozens of international organizations, the
United Nations, Red Cross and many [non-governmental organizations] that
are present in the field. The Civil Administration is very familiar with
these groups. This stems from the fact that the state of Israel cannot
fill the organizations' function. Since the aid is necessary, it is best
filled by the international groups and not, say, Hamas. Better to create
a real humanitarian infrastructure and not that of Hamas' terrorist
summer camps. The Civil Administration has trained its own
""international organization officers."" The Israel Defense Forces [IDF]
has now integrated humanitarian aid into its combat doctrine.

Q: Yet the international organizations complain of friction
with the IDF.

A: It is not always simple to balance combat with humanitarian
aid. There are issues of time and space: first the battle has to end.
Moreover, over the years fears and suspicions develop. [We have learned
that] not every ambulance and aid shipment is ""clean""; so suspicions
arise. With good communications we can solve these problems. This
insight has now penetrated deep into the IDF combat echelon; the soldier
at the roadblock better understands the need for aid.

Q: Yet over the past year or so, the aid organizations have
talked about pulling out.

A: They won't depart. There was a disguised threat to leave, but
largely to pressure Israel to let them get the job done. If they were to
pull out, this would not end the conflict; on the contrary, the
resultant poverty would worsen the situation. The vacuum would not be
filled entirely by Israel but by Hamas.

Q: Why? Why can't Israel provide the aid if need be? Or the
Palestinian Authority?

A: You can't turn back the clock to status quo ante. If the aid
ends [even under conditions of peace], the Palestinian Authority is
still not capable of filling the gap. But [neither can we, because the
Palestinian Authority] aspires to independence and has learned not to
work with us. In any case Israel never provided 100 percent.

Q: There are allegations that Palestinian inefficiency and
corruption complicate the aid picture.

A: Inefficiency contributes to lack of development. This touches
not on the question whether there's enough food, but rather on
infrastructure development, for example the Palestinian water economy.
Of course, the conflict makes things worse, but (even without it)
Palestinian government offices are not organized as they should be.
[Minister of Finance Salam] Fayyad has still not succeeded in breaking
the monopolies on energy supply, cement and agricultural exports.

The aid organizations come to us with these complaints, but there is
little we can do. We try to provide security, mobility, and the
necessary statutory permits--areas where the Palestinians are weak.

Q: Does the international aid improve or hinder Israel's
relations with the aid-giving countries and organizations?

A: Improve, unequivocally. In the eyes of the aid-givers as well,
the joint projects and working relationships contribute to relations.

Q: Israel and the Palestinian Authority developed a complex
economic relationship after 1993. In retrospect, was this beneficial?

A: The present situation of intifada is not natural and does not
bear faithful testimony to the relationship. In view of the huge
disparity between the economies, the Oslo and Paris agreements were the
right ones in their day. The Palestinian economy was supposed to grow,
to stand on its own two feet. They were to have their own air and sea
ports and economic independence. The process can still be renewed with
joint industrial zones and the return of Palestinian labor to Israel.

The trade balance at its peak was about $2.6 billion per annum in
Palestinian imports from Israel and $800 million in Palestinian exports
to Israel. This was Israel's biggest trading relationship after the
United States. This has declined radically since the intifada began.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: How has foreign aid influenced the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict, particularly in recent years?

A: Donors have said very specifically for a decade now that
foreign aid is designed to underpin a peace process. They say very
bluntly and openly that aid to the Palestinian Authority is seen as
peace implementation or peace facilitation. Whether or not it has played
that role is another question.

I think that foreign aid has played an important role to some extent in
reducing the distortion in the occupied Palestinian territories that
existed particularly in the period prior to the last ten years.
Palestinian incomes were rising while their public services,
infrastructure and public spaces were degrading for close to 30 years
[after Israel's 1967 occupation].

For the last decade, though, personal incomes /have/ been on the decline
due to Israeli measures blocking Palestinian access to the Israeli labor
and commodity markets. The aid has to some extent served to mitigate the
distortion of this occupied economy. In the last three years, much of
the aid has been budgetary support for the Palestinian Authority to
allow it to be able to meet salary payments.

Q: How then has the aid influenced the course of the conflict?

A: Some donor countries have said openly, and others have said
not so openly, that for the last two years at least, they have been
financing the fallout of Israel's measures rather than allowing Israel
to bear the full weight of its actions and pay for the damage and
destruction that it has caused. Seen from that donor perspective, some
might say that they have fueled the conflict--if the aid had stopped,
then the Israelis would bear a much bigger burden and not engage in the
behavior that they have.

Q: Is the international community considering pulling back
for this reason?

A: I think that the donors are engaged in that rethinking. It is
a good question.

Q: Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority draw a large
portion of their budget from foreign aid. How might each, in a perfect
world, make the transition to a self-sufficient economy?

A: Were it not for the movement restrictions and the difficulties
imposed on the Palestinian population as a result of Israeli measures,
there would be no need for budgetary support. In 1999, [the Palestinian
Authority] had a balanced operating budget. The Palestinian Authority,
relative to what it has received, however, would have only minimally
been able to cover the development budget that creates medical
facilities, public infrastructure, public space, technical assistance, etc.

Let's keep in mind that we are talking about a population that has a
large component of refugees and that has been under occupation since
1967. The degradation of public infrastructure has been great and
ongoing for nearly four decades.

Israel, on the other hand, is the largest recipient of external funding
in the world, bar none. On a per capita basis, that equals three times
what the Palestinians receive, and somewhere over $1,000 per person per
year. Could the Israelis do without that? Most of this assistance is
official and comes from the United States. Roughly half of that is
military assistance. If Israel wants to maintain the fourth largest army
in the world at the current level of readiness, then it will probably
have to continue to receive that amount.

Q: Given the experience of the Oslo accords where donors
gave a large amount of money and then the process collapsed, if there
were to be a comprehensive settlement would there also be a willingness
to give?

A: My sense is that if there were to be a comprehensive
settlement bringing real peace and justice, the donors would give more.
In the past three years, most of the assistance has come from Arab
countries for budget support [of the Palestinian Authority]. In that
case, the Arab states would play a greater role if a comprehensive
solution were to be found. The other main donors of the
Palestinians--the European Union, Japan, and the United States--would
probably also be forthcoming.
"
"Isr","Neut","The Israeli reaction to the events in the Jenin refugee camp raises
several significant questions. Why indeed does the vast majority of
Israelis--not just extreme rightists--appear not to be reacting to the
killing of numerous innocent civilians, including children? Even if
there was no deliberate massacre; even if we can argue that it was the
terrorists who forced innocent civilians to remain in their booby
trapped homes who bear the guilt for their deaths--why haven't we heard
at least an expression of condolence on the part of the Israeli public
mainstream, with the exception of a few eternal peace professionals? Why
this anger at United Nations envoy Terje Larsen, even after he
repeatedly explained that he did not say and never intended to say that
Israel carried out a massacre in Jenin?

The sad answer to these questions appears to be that the conflict has
reached such a level of hostility that every incident is perceived as a
zero-sum exercise. Thus, even someone expressing sadness upon the death
of Palestinian children is perceived as a ""traitor"" who is not
sufficiently grieving over the death of his own people.

The Palestinians appear to have a larger responsibility for the
deterioration of the situation. This can be proven with a simple
chronology: until the Passover massacre in Netanya and the Israeli
offensive that followed, official Israel, and many rank-and-file
Israelis, continued to express sorrow over Palestinian civilian
casualties, particularly children, that were caused by Israeli actions.
In contrast the Palestinians focused on indiscriminate terrorism
directed against Israeli civilians; women, children and the aged were
""preferred"" targets no less than soldiers. (I do not intend here, God
forbid, to legitimize attacks on soldiers, but simply to state that a
war against soldiers could still be considered within the acceptable
""rules"" of war, in contrast with attacks upon civilians, including
settlers.)

It is the focus of the current war on civilians--in contrast with all of
Israel's previous wars (including the 1948 War of Independence, in which
civilian casualties were secondary targets)--that has generated the
sense that this is a total war, one between peoples. Hence the absence
of compassion. If they have no pity on our children (actually, on their
own children as well), why should we have pity on theirs?

But there is more. What has sharpened the Israeli lack of compassion is
the international campaign to protest Israel's acts of self-defense. The
combination of these two phenomena has gone to the depths of Jewish
identity to arouse primeval gut Jewish emotions. For the first time
since the Holocaust (perhaps with the exception of the days that
preceded the Six-Day War on 1967) Jews--this time in their Israeli
identity--have again felt that their backs are to the wall: they are
struggling not only for their physical existence, but for their right to
exist in principle. Even if these sensations are exaggerated, they
cannot be denigrated or dismissed; a people that has experienced the
mass extermination of the Holocaust has the full right to fear for its
fate in more ""minor"" situations as well.

One of the ""proofs"" in Israeli eyes of the totality of the struggle is
the recent wave of anti-Semitic incidents in Europe. If the Palestinians
explain terrorism against Israel as one aspect of a general escalation
of their national struggle, how do they explain the wave of attacks on
Jews and Jewish institutions in Europe? After all, the Jews of Europe
bear no responsibility for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; why should
they suffer as its victims? Thus if they are indeed the targets of a
wave of attacks, this strengthens the sense that we are confronting a
total offensive against our very national existence. The silence of
Palestinians and other Arabs in the face of these attacks proves
ostensibly that they are satisfied with them--whereas were Jews, even
under present circumstances, to attack mosques in Europe, no doubt the
entire Jewish leadership, including in Israel, would raise its voice in
protest.

Accordingly if the Arab states, and particularly Palestinians, want to
invoke a confidence-building measure that might restore among Israelis
the sense that this is not an all-out struggle over Jewish national
existence but rather a Palestinian struggle for national freedom--they
could, for example, launch a public diplomacy campaign against attacks
on Jews worldwide, and especially in Europe. If Palestinians make their
voices heard on this issue then perhaps the sense of total struggle will
diminish, and Israelis, too, can express sorrow over the deaths of
Palestinian children, regardless of the situation in which they were
killed and the question of responsibility for their deaths.
"
"Pal","Neut","The current Israeli military offensive in the Palestinian Territories is
a flagrant violation of all international laws and a cataclysm in the
path of a genuine and comprehensive peace in the region. This Israeli
military rampage against Palestinian civilians and their leader Yasser
Arafat has not only crippled the efforts for peace but totally
devastated the Palestinian physical and institutional infrastructure
built over the last 10 years to establish a Palestinian state. Such
horrendous acts perpetrated by Israel have caused more despair for the
advocates of real peace and have outraged the Arab streets.

Nonetheless, the suffering of the Palestinian people at the hands of
war-mongering Israeli soldiers has gained the Palestinian cause dramatic
world support and further cemented Arafat's position in the Arab world
and among Palestinians.

With the help of information technology and satellite transmission, the
Palestinian narrative has been conveyed to a larger number of people
around the globe. Networking and fast communication via the Internet has
given the global community greater access to alternative news sources
and created more awareness of the Palestinian perspective in the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

The impact of increased access to information and media alternatives has
been felt most recently through the flow of international volunteers to
the Palestinian Territories to form what is known as the International
Solidarity Movement in Palestine. Furthermore, the explosion of Arab
satellite channels and the images of Palestinian suffering they convey
plays an integral role in mobilizing the Arab masses to express their
anger, ideological leanings and frustrations to their leaders.
Unfortunately, there remains a huge discrepancy between the wishes of
the Arab street and the performance of official Arab governments.

The lack of Arab initiatives for pressuring the United States
administration, together with the presence of a strong Jewish lobby in
the United States, mean that the Palestinian narrative remains only
partially visible, if not distorted, in the US media. In fact, the US
media manipulated by Jewish lobbyists has bolstered the Israeli
narrative by using the incidents of September 11th as a means of
justifying the Israeli military offensive as a ""war against terror."" The
power of the Jewish lobby over the US public and administration explains
the half-way stance conveyed by the US through Secretary of State Colin
Powell's failed visit and President George W. Bush's recent biased
statements against the Palestinian national cause and leader Yasser Arafat.

The European position on the current political situation in the
Palestinian Territories is more moderate, but remains ineffective,
especially on the official level. The public position, as evidenced in
European newspapers and news broadcasting networks, is more inclined
towards the Palestinian narrative. In Britain, 80 percent of the British
Parliament, which conveys the will of its constituents, expressed
support for freezing military exports to Israel due to the current
violations of the Israeli military in the Palestinian Territories.

As such, the lack of peace in Palestine will have adverse ramifications
on the region and for the international community. It is essential for
the US and the European Union to take a more proactive role in ending
the Israeli occupation, which is the only recipe for peace and security
in the area. Such a political intervention on part of the US and
European administrations is contingent on an international public that
is aware of and in contact with the Palestinian narrative. Therefore,
the establishment of an Arab satellite channel capable of communicating
with the outside world is a vital step for increasing regularized
contact between the regions. In an era of globalization, where political
interests transcend national boundaries, such a bridge of communication
is certain to bring about international participation in resolving the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict. A transparent, balanced world media is a
platform for global civil societies to democratize our world and reshape
the mechanism of political decision-making in the context of the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
"
"Isr","Neut","The meeting of the Quartet in New York last week dealt with the ""plan""
enunciated by United States President George W. Bush in his June 24,
2002 speech. None of the non-American participants hid their objections
to one major element of the speech, namely, President Bush's call for a
new and different Palestinian leadership. Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said on returning to Moscow that there was no discussion of
Arafat, but all except the Americans agreed that the Palestinians have
the right to pick their own leaders.

The element of Bush's speech that was apparently discussed at length was
the reform of the Palestinian Authority, a measure believed necessary by
the Europeans who have been financing much of the PA's activities, and
supported by the Palestinians themselves. One issue evidently discussed
in this context is the idea of outside supervision, that is, the
possibility of an international force for the territories. Most of the
European states, as well as United Nations Secretary General Kofi Anan,
have repeatedly proposed the dispatch of some kind of international
contingent, and the Arab states (Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia) whose
representatives met with the Quartet also raised the matter.

Both the proposals to the Quartet by the Arab representatives and an
earlier French proposal link international supervision to the idea of
elections--which are part of the Bush plan. The Americans would be the
first to argue that an election campaign and elections themselves cannot
be held without freedom of movement and freedom of association, nor in
the intimidating presence of an occupation army. It was the presence of
the Red Army (and Tito's own army) that helped impede free elections in
Eastern Europe after WWII--a factor that the United States protested
officially at the time. The reform proposed by Bush would necessitate
the withdrawal of Israeli forces (presumably to the September 28, 2000
positions). Similarly Palestinian election procedures must have
international supervision, as they did in 1996, while there must be some
assurance of security--including a reduction of violence that the
Palestinians themselves would want for the elections. Thus elections,
demanded by the Americans, might be the vehicle for the introduction of
an international contingent, of a size and nature
(civilian/peacekeeping, large/small) to be determined, along with the
length of stay.

In sum: the Quartet, along with the Arab states, may be working toward a
way of reducing the violence and securing an Israeli withdrawal by means
of elections and the international monitoring required to create
conditions for such elections.

According to the Palestinian Authority, elections are going to be held
in the winter (January 2003?). Preparations are in fact already
underway. Ignoring for the moment the relative certainty that Arafat
will be reelected (and not merely as a figurehead), the elections
themselves may offer a means of changing the situation on the ground. If
free, democratic elections are indeed to be held, it is perfectly in
order to demand a withdrawal of Israeli forces from area A, a return to
the September 28, 2000 positions, and freedom of movement for the
population within the West Bank. If these measures cannot be instigated
because of Israeli security concerns, an international force under the
Americans can assume positions throughout the territories. International
observers were present in the 1996 elections to the Palestine Authority;
it may be argued that a far larger observer contingent in the form of an
observer force is necessary today.

Whereas the American plan posits the end of terrorism as a first step
before an Israeli draw-back, a prior Israeli draw-back with
international observers could be the first step and a factor toward
ending the terrorism. Elections cannot be held in the absence of order
and security any more than they can be held in the absence of freedom of
movement and freedom to assemble. It will thus be in the interest of the
Palestinians as well as the Israelis to ensure all of these elements.
Conceivably, such assurances could only come from a third party, namely,
an international observer or monitoring force.

There have been suggestions that such a force become permanent. There is
the possibility that the territories be placed under international
trusteeship or mandate, which would ensure security until a Palestinian
state were to rise. Such a proposal would require a total Israeli
withdrawal from the territories, implying unilateral withdrawal in the
absence of a negotiated settlement. There is some support for this idea
in the Israeli public, even majority support when the matter is posed as
separation from the territories with Israel drawing its own separation
line--irrespective of who or what would police the territories after
Israeli withdrawal.

Support for separation derives from the wish on the part of the public
to be rid of the conflict with the Palestinians (in the belief that a
fence or border would halt terrorism inside Israel) and a belief that
there is no partner for a negotiated settlement, at least at this time.
Unilateral withdrawal, however, namely any form of separation that also
removes the Israel Defense Forces and the settlers, cannot be expected
from the present Israeli government. Given this, a trusteeship or
mandate would appear to be out of the question. A temporary
international force, linked to the elections that the Americans demand,
without evacuation of settlements or total withdrawal of the IDF might
be acceptable (under pressure) to the government of Israel. At the
least, the connection with the American-demanded elections might provide
the leverage needed to gain Israeli agreement.

The temporary nature of the observer force is important, probably
crucial for Israeli agreement, but if such a force coupled with
elections could serve the purpose of reducing or eliminating the
violence, the way would then presumably be cleared for the
implementation of the Mitchell recommendations or some form of
negotiations. Worth a try.
"
"Pal","Neut","The creation of the Quartet appears to be one more episode in the
history of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in which key players
pull together due to concerns that one of them (namely the United
States) is running off in an unwise direction. The Europeans are
glomming on to a quadripartite formation with the Americans, a setback
for those of us who had hoped that the Europeans would acquire more
policy independence. At the same time that the Quartet may put some
brakes on the dominant superpower, it neutralizes any independent action
by the Europeans.

Still, it is not as if the European Union were ready with a major
foreign policy initiative. The problem of the EU is the problem of its
institutionalized Common Foreign and Security Policy. Nothing can be
done without the agreement of all 15 states. Of these, several have
important individual foreign policy preoccupations and special
interests. The British want to maintain a special relationship with the
Americans; the French want the freedom to maintain their own independent
international profile and agendas; and the Germans want nothing to do
with policies appearing unfriendly to Israel, home to victims of the
Nazi Holocaust.

Also in the Quartet is the United Nations. While the UN secretary
general has been on very amicable terms with successive American
administrations, the United Nations itself has a public discourse that
is bound by its Charter, public international law and recognizing the
relationship between peace and security on the one hand, and respect for
human rights and democratic principles on the other.

These three players in the Quartet--the Secretary General's office, the
Europeans and the Russians (albeit still considered minor
contributors)--are not quite comfortable with the locomotive of American
global policy that has now thoughtlessly taken up Israel's long-standing
maneuvering to undermine the foundations of international humanitarian
law for its own purposes. For it part, Israel wants to enjoy maximum
freedom as an occupying power to destroy the public institutional
frameworks of the Palestinians and to destroy once again the
territorial, infrastructural, institutional and demographic foundations
from which a modern Palestinian urban political and economic culture
might re-emerge. Like several previous Israeli governments, Sharon's
view is that it is better to deal with the Palestinians as a fragmented,
tribal sub-state entity.

It is worth noting that this flies in the face of all that Europe has
pursued in the Mediterranean region. The EU has committed itself to
stimulating reforms driven by the process of free trade that would help
foster the re-emergence of outward-looking, tolerant urban-based
civilizations in the Mashreq, the Maghreb and Egypt. Europe desperately
wants respite from the nightmare of insecurity and instability, lack of
progress and lack of economic growth that has characterized the tribal
and autocratic political and social orders that emerged since the
forties from the destruction and decay of the urban economic and
cultural centers in the region--a process that included the Palestinian
Naqba. Europe wants a stable, prosperous, cooperative and economically
engaged southern and eastern Mediterranean neighbor.

That is why the issue of Palestinian ""reform"" has been a key European
concern for some time--long before Israel picked up the slogan. However
impatient the Europeans got with Palestinian resistance to vitally
needed reforms, Europe appears to have always understood the need for
Palestinians to lead reforms for Palestinians. Unfortunately, the slogan
of ""reform"" has recently been hijacked by a disingenuous US agenda aimed
more at manipulating Palestinian national politics, and an even more
disingenuous Israeli agenda aimed at destroying Palestinian national
politics. Still, the reform package, plagued by all these contradictions
beneath the surface, has found traction. Under these conditions the
Europeans cannot suddenly say no to demands for Palestinian reform. They
can only hope to steer the reform project away from the destructive
directions that Israel, and, for different reasons, the US wish to take it.

The Quartet's moves to date have reflected these internal differences.
Everybody has gone for ""reform"" and everybody has gone for the need to
give a political horizon to the Palestinians based on a fully sovereign
and viable state. Basically, everyone is trying to file down the sharp
edges of the others' eccentric positions. As a result, it is even more
improbable that Europe will attempt to maintain any pretence of
independence.

None of this give or take, however, will correct the fatal flaw of the
peace process begun at Madrid. Israel maintained its refusal to be bound
by the principles of international humanitarian law--which prohibited
its establishment of settlements, expropriations of Palestinian land and
numerous other predatory and repressive measures that it regularly took
against the civilian population. Ever since US Secretary of State James
Baker asked his Palestinian interlocutors in Jerusalem during the run-up
to the Madrid Conference ""what do you want: to clean up the occupation
or to end it?"", the US managed to persuade skeptical Europeans and
credulous Palestinians that its would be possible to build confidence
between the Israeli and Palestinian sides, achieve political
rapprochement and end Israel's occupation, without requiring Israel to
respect international humanitarian law in the interim.

Baker's words were later mouthed by Palestinian leaders who truly
believed that the Americans were on the verge of delivering a political
magic hat trick--pulling political justice out of thin air. Palestinians
argued that demanding the implementation of international humanitarian
law would only hamper the American effort by insisting on something that
the Israelis would surely refuse. Time and time again, in the framework
of the Oslo process Palestinian leaders enthusiastically signed
agreements that treated key internationally-guaranteed rights protected
by international humanitarian law as if they did not exist. This gave
the rest of the world, including the Europeans, the excuse they sought
for doing almost nothing to restrain Israel's violations--and for not
incurring Israeli and American displeasure.

While elements of the Palestinian leadership have attempted to invoke
the Fourth Geneva Convention in times of crisis, the international will
to stand behind the Convention has been seriously weakened. The European
Union may well recognize that the belated enforcement of international
humanitarian law offers the only hope for mounting a successful process
of Palestinian reform and the only basis for restraining Israel's
efforts to force Palestinian society back into a fragmented and
easily-controlled tribal order under a revived Israeli Civil
Administration. However, the dynamics of the Quartet, and continued
official Palestinian faux pas make it unlikely that Europe will make any
moves in this direction.

Several weeks before the Quartet meeting Switzerland summoned the
courage to circulate a ""non-paper"" proposing the mobilization of an
initiative including the Quartet to reintroduce the discipline of
humanitarian law into the Palestinian-Israeli process, and the
establishment of an international monitoring presence for this purpose.
A copy was delivered to two senior Palestinian officials during one of
Ramallah's curfews. It was forgotten. The Palestinian official
responsible for diplomatic follow-up never received a copy. There was no
Palestinian follow-up. Predictably in such circumstances, little or no
interest was shown by the states to whom it was circulated.

Those Palestinians who advocate Palestinian reform for the Palestinian
good are definitely on the right track. But we and our friends will have
to recognize that we have a lot of reforms to accomplish on lots of
fronts. We have to come to grips with the fact that we are a long way
from ending Israel's occupation in a satisfactory fashion. We need to
re-think our struggle and not become unwitting accomplices to the
strategies of our adversaries. We cannot allow ourselves to be reduced
to impotent, easily controlled tribal champions of tribal causes--the
unaware products of a second Naqba. We need to better understand and use
the political logic and protective potential of the law, and welcome its
burdens and constraints. We need to learn how not to squander the little
points of leverage we may command, and how to enlist the benign
self-interest of other powerful actors who would prefer us to succeed.
But we must first understand what success entails.

These are unfair burdens to place on any hugely oppressed people. They
are also our keys to survival.
"
"Isr","Neut","If, and when, the boundaries of the Palestinian state are demarcated and
implemented on the ground as part of a final phase agreement, the time
will come for the issue of Israeli settlement removal to be dealt with
at a practical level. The options for settlement evacuation are varied
but must include some, or all, of the following factors.

There must be a sufficient time lead between settling the details of the
final agreement and the eventual evacuation of those settlers who are
prepared to go peacefully, to enable them to arrange their own affairs.
The government of Israel must plan for alternative residential solutions
inside Israel, through the construction of new settlements or new
neighborhoods in existing towns, to absorb the evacuees in permanent
housing conditions.

A public agency should be established to deal with the wide range of
relocation problems, such as housing, education and employment for those
settlers who work in the West Bank and Gaza public and municipal
networks. By the same token, consultancy and psychological services must
be provided for those settlers who are traumatically affected by their
forced evacuation, especially those who perceive the evacuation as
shattering their political and religious dreams.

Adequate financial compensation should be provided for settler families
to help them get a new life in order. Unlike the Sinai experience, this
should be worked out in advance and should not be subject to a long
period of negotiation between settler leaders and government officials,
which only serves to cheapen the process in the public eye and make the
settlers out as a group of economic opportunists. No settlements should
be destroyed or razed to the ground as happened in Sinai, especially in
the Yamit region. The settlements can either be sold, or handed over, to
the Palestinian state/Authority and can serve as potential housing
solutions for some of the refugee population. Settlements which remain
in situ as a result of boundary redrawing should be encouraged to adopt
settlements which have to be evacuated--perhaps even to absorb some of
the evacuated settlers into their own communities. In this way, the
settler population would feel a limited sense of common fate with people
who originally moved to the West Bank for the same reasons and, but for
the quirk of the cartographer's pen, would have shared the same fate.

As far as possible, settler leaders and activists should be involved,
either publicly or privately, in the detailed stages of planned
evacuation, especially in cases where relocation may take place to new
settlements that will be constructed for them inside Israel. While many
of the settler leaders will refuse to undertake what they see as an act
of ""collaboration,"" it is reasonable to assume that once the reality
sinks in, some will be prepared to become involved (even with the secret
blessing of the political leaders) so as to ensure the least possible
disruption.

As much settlement relocation as possible should occur during the summer
months when children are on vacation, so that they can be in place for
the start of the new school year, and in order that no school be
disrupted by a sudden closure or a gradual loss of students over an
extended time period.

As a means of gaining gradual acceptance amongst the settlers that they
will have to eventually relocate, a number of messages need to be
disseminated. The settlers need to be told:

  # that the longer term benefit of peace, or at least an end to
    violence and conflict, is a greater benefit to Israel as a whole
    than the continuation of settlements;

  # that the Israeli population--left and right wing alike--understands
    the political sacrifice that will be made by the settlers and will
    be prepared to assist them in the painful relocation process;

  # that in today's political and military climate, settlements are
    perceived as being a security burden rather than an asset and that
    their own lives (and those of their children) are threatened by
    remaining in these dangerous locations;

  # that many new challenges face the State of Israel in a post-conflict
    era, in the fields of education, welfare and health policies, in
    developing the country's peripheral regions, and that the settler
    population is ideally suited, due to its ideological fervor and
    commitment to the state, to meet many of these new challenges;

  # and that physical or violent opposition to evacuation will only
    serve to worsen the settlers' image amongst the wider Israeli
    population who will see them as peace spoilers and social outcasts.
    Holding out for their ideological cause could potentially do them
    long term harm in their ability to eventually reintegrate back into
    Israel. 

Nothing should be done to drive a wedge between different sectors of the
settler population. While this may work with those settlers who are
prepared to receive their compensation and relocate at an early
pre-agreement stage, this will only make the other settlers more
determined in their opposition to any such moves. At the same time, the
agreement of some to relocate may have a snowball effect, gradually
drawing in wider and wider circles of people who were previously not
prepared to leave their homes.

Public awareness of the options available should be put into operation
as soon as possible. The greater the familiarity with the practical
mechanics of settlement evacuation, the greater the chance that it can
actually take place in a relatively calm and orderly atmosphere. This
would be to the long term benefit of both the peace process and Israeli
society.
"
"Pal","Neut","Palestinian refugees, Jerusalem, settlements, water and borders are all
interrelated core conflict issues that have been postponed till final
status negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. Despite the
current regression in the peace process, the two sides will--sooner or
later--come to an agreement that will embrace the two state solution,
with Jerusalem as the shared capital of those two states. In principle,
the borders of the Palestinian state will be the pre-1967 borders with
minor mutual and reciprocal border changes to allow for for geographic
integrity of the West Bank and Gaza, as well as consolidating some
settlements to Israel. Consequently, a final agreement between Israelis
and Palestinians will address the fate of the Israeli settlements in the
state of Palestine.

It is assumed that the two sides will negotiate in good faith to reach
an agreement for the withdrawal of Israeli settlers from Palestine
according to an agreed-upon timetable. Israel may decide to dismantle
and demolish the settlements and their infrastructure before its
withdrawal, but this would be an unwise and costly decision. A more
realistic approach would be to transfer the settlements and their
infrastructure to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in a phased
and organized manner.

Can Israel deal with the demographic pressure resulting from settlement
evacuation? During the early nineties, Israel was receiving immigrants
from the former Soviet Union in the scope of more than 300,000 per year.
The current Israeli budget for settlements in the Palestinian areas
comes close to $4 billion, which will be enough to absorb the settlers
within Israel's borders. In addition, the current security expenditures
for the settlers will no longer be necessary.

What to do with the evacuated settlements? At present, two separate and
distinctly varying infrastructures exist in the Palestinian areas: one
for the settlers and the other for Palestinians. Nevertheless,
Palestinians should benefit from the existing settlement infrastructure
and try to integrate it within the Palestinian physical planning
process. This is a challenging task since the current planning process
has worked to segregate Palestinian communities from settlements. The
PNA will utilize the settlements to alleviate some of the housing
problems for the current residents and to absorb the large number of
Palestinian returnees who will come back with the creation of the state
of Palestine. The Palestinian public should be prepared psychologically
by the leadership to accept the idea of living in the ""occupier's home,""
which may be a problem for a large number of Palestinians.

The functions of each settlement, including its type (agricultural,
industrial, urban or other), shall be preserved without significant
alterations for the benefit of the emerging Palestinian state and
Palestinian society. Issues such as urban form, fabric, settlement
pattern, housing and architectural elements will all be considered in
order to harmonize those settlements with Palestinian cities and
villages. Additional architectural elements and new urban structures
will be added to the settlements, as well as to the Palestinian built-up
areas, in order to reduce the existing disparities. The physical
infrastructure of Israeli settlements, such as the roads and
transportation networks, sewage and drainage systems that are currently
connected by the Israeli physical infrastructure, will have to be
integrated and harmonized and linked to the Palestinian infrastructure
system.

Within the final status negotiations, stipulations will be made for
conducting a comprehensive inventory of houses, infrastructure,
industrial and agricultural facilities, as well as public utilities in
the settlements. A third party may need to assist in this process. In
assessing these items, consideration needs to be given to those who paid
these costs, since a good portion of the budget of Israel's so-called
""civil administration"" has been diverted to settlements from Palestinian
taxpayers. Palestinians may not be willing to accept certain industrial
plants in the settlements, in which case, Israel will have to move them
at its own expense. Once an agreement is reached on the assessment of
all facilities, their official transfer to Palestinian authority will
preferably take place through a third party. The handover will require
the creation of a Palestinian ministry for absorption to receive the
settlements and their infrastructure, as well as prepare a plan for
their resettlement and operation.

One of the major tasks of this new ministry will be to allocate housing
and work with the original landowners whose land was confiscated for the
construction of the settlements. In principle, landowners should be
given priority (under well-defined guidelines) for reacquiring their
confiscated lands, as well as living in the evacuated houses, or
compensated fully if they choose not to. For the rest of the
settlements, well-defined criteria for occupying the evacuated
settlements will have to be developed.
"
"Isr","Neut","The post-Arafat shape of Palestinian politics is becoming clear. Its
features and the outcome of the struggles involved will have a huge
effect on the future of the conflict and the possibility of a negotiated
peace settlement.

The key elements are as follows.

It is a mistake to view anyone, including Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas), as
the post-Arafat leader of the Palestinians. He is already leader of the
PLO and might become head of the Palestinian Authority (PA)--""president""
in the Palestinian terminology. But that does not mean his authority
will be heeded by the PA bureaucracy, Fateh, or the security services.
The al-Aqsa Brigades and Hamas will ignore his orders unless forced to
act otherwise.

Abu Mazen certainly does not control Fateh. That organization's new head
is Faruq Qaddumi, a hardliner who is much more popular than Abu Mazen
and who reflects more faithfully the ideas of the Fateh leadership and
membership.

While the PLO and PA are largely paper organizations or at most
bureaucracies, it is Fateh where power really resides and where
decisions will actually be made. In addition, those with guns are going
to decide whether terrorism continues and whether violence will be
turned against Palestinian moderates even if they are supposedly the
movement's new leaders.

This division of power also reflects the fact that the nationalist
movement is split into three main factions, albeit very loosely
constituted and divided among themselves. Briefly and simply they can be
defined along the following lines:

The moderates. Abu Mazen is the key person in this group and the support
given him by Muhammad Dahlan, a former security official with a big
following in the Gaza Strip, is very important. Prime Minister Abu Ala
(Ahmed Qurei) can also be put into this category, though it is not clear
how well he will work with Abu Mazen.

This grouping realizes that the intifada has been largely a disaster for
the Palestinians. They want to end the violence and negotiate an
agreement with Israel in order to obtain an independent Palestinian
state. But before they can make real progress toward this goal, they
will have to take control of the movement and stop the violence.

Their problem is how to do so, especially given that the other main
groupings--the older-generation hardliners, young radicals, and
Hamas--all oppose them. They need to recruit support from the security
services and the Palestinian Legislative Council, but their success here
will be neither easy nor guaranteed.

The older-generation hardliners: Qaddumi is the most important person in
this group, but it arguably includes the great majority of Fateh
officials and activists. They adhere to what they view as Arafat's
legacy of refusing to compromise on anything less than total victory or
at least an interim settlement that would not interfere with their
ongoing efforts to destroy Israel. In this context, the demand for a
complete Palestinian ""right of return"" to Israel is essential.

While these people are backing Abu Mazen as the public face of the
movement, they view him as more of a figurehead and are determined to
restrain him from going too far in making a peace deal with Israel. But
they also support Abu Mazen because they hate the young radicals and
Hamas, preferring to stick together with their old comrades who are
equally devoted to Fateh's hegemony.

The young radicals. Not all younger people in Fateh support this group
but it consists of a new generation that does not respect the current
establishment. They are veterans of the first intifada and their most
important leader is Marwan Barghouti, while their organizations include
the Tanzim grassroots group and al-Aqsa Brigades.

What is especially significant about this group is that it is quite
willing to work closely with Hamas on terrorist attacks and probably on
the political level as well. If this strategy wins out in the movement,
any chance for peace would be lost, perhaps for decades, as Hamas could
veto any moderation.

If Abu Mazen wins the elections and becomes the new PA head, this will
of course strengthen his position. But how much such an event would
empower him should not be exaggerated.

The influence of Israel, or the United States and the West in general
for that matter, on Palestinian politics is also quite limited. Israel
can try to use confidence-building methods and flexibility to show that
the moderates can deliver results to the Palestinians. An attempt should
also be made to coordinate the redeployment from the Gaza Strip with the
moderate leadership. Perhaps, too, this would help Abu Mazen in the
elections.

Yet the hardliners of all factions discount Israeli concessions as
tricks while simultaneously portraying them as victories won by armed
struggle. Hence the effects of such efforts will be very much diluted.
Overwhelmingly, the future of Palestinian politics will be determined by
the Palestinians themselves.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: You have been a vocal proponent of the importance of
holding elections for a long time now. But is there any added importance
to them now after the passing of President Yasser Arafat?

A: Certainly. To a large extent elections are always important
because of the need to gain legitimacy for the political system, any
political system. But especially now, that Arafat, who had the
legitimacy of the legacy and the PLO, is gone, it becomes extremely
critical that Palestinians have elections or face violent internal
infighting, competition within the nationalist movement between young
guard and old guard, and between nationalists and Islamists. So it
certainly is critical at the moment to go to elections as soon as possible.

Q: You feel those are the options? Elections or infighting?

A: Absolutely. If we do not go to elections, in my view there
will be bloody, internal infighting.

Q: At the moment everyone seems focused on presidential
elections. Is it important to hold all the elections, municipal and
legislative as well, or are the presidential elections the most important?

A: I think the most important elections are the legislative
elections and that we need to have legislative elections, or start a
credible election process for the legislature, as soon as possible. I
think that is the most critical need at the moment. Presidential and
local elections are certainly important as well, but in terms of helping
Palestinians avoid internal infighting, I think it is critical to have
legislative elections as soon as possible.

Q: What chances do you see of the Islamist factions,
particularly Hamas and Islamic Jihad, participating in such elections?

A: I have absolutely no doubt that most, if not all, the
Islamist groups will participate in the legislative elections. This is
going to be their golden opportunity to become active in the Palestinian
political system, to gain a strong voice in the Palestinian parliament,
and therefore essentially affect decision-making at all levels, but in
particular with regard to legislation. They are not likely to become
part of the government, and it is for this reason that they don't care
about, and probably won't participate in, the presidential elections.
But they are, I believe, very much interested in gaining a very
important and strong opposition voice in the political institutions. I
think they recognize that because they failed to do so in 1996, they
became highly marginal in Palestinian politics for the next four years,
1996 to 2000. I doubt very much they would want to repeat that mistake
again.

Q: But aren't they in a bind? Wouldn't participating in
legislative elections be an implicit acknowledgement of the Oslo
agreements?

A: To a large extent there is recognition in Palestinian society
and in the political system that the Oslo agreements have long since
disappeared as practical guidelines for policy-making. And to a large
extent there is a perception that the Palestinian legislature will be
able to decide on its own what it wants to do with no limitations
imposed by the Oslo agreements. There is recognition that this does not
apply to the government, that practical realities on the ground requires
coordination and perhaps cooperation with the Israelis at certain levels
whether it is in civil administration or in security matters. And that
is certainly something the Islamists will want to avoid doing, and
therefore will avoid becoming a part of the government.

Q: Clearly it is logistically not that easy to hold
elections at the moment. What needs to be done?

A: First of all we need to immediately deal with our own
electoral system, which is currently being reviewed. I believe most of
the work has already been completed. The parliament probably needs two
more weeks to vote on the amended elections law.

Second, we need to bring about an internal agreement among all the
factions on a ceasefire during the election campaign and on election day
itself.

Third, we need the Israelis to respect this internal ceasefire by
observing a ceasefire of their own, and stop their incursions and the
assassinations.

Fourth, we need the Israelis to pull out from the cities and remove the
checkpoints during the election period so people can freely move about
and so candidates can promote their views without fearing assassination
or arrest by the Israelis.

Q: All of sudden, it seems, there is great international
interest in Palestinian elections. Outgoing US Secretary of State Colin
Powell has expressed an interest in the US financially aiding the
elections, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has suddenly come out in
favor of Jerusalemites voting, when it was very difficult for them to
even register for elections earlier this year. Why?

A: I think there is recognition that the absence of Arafat from
the scene creates certain opportunities and Washington and Israel are
wary of making the same mistake they made in 2003, in terms of missing
an opportunity with the appointment of Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) as
prime minister. There is that recognition today, and I think neither the
Israelis nor the Americans want to give the impression that they are
going to squander this opportunity as well.

Q: Are you confident that the elections will take place?

A: At the moment I think the decision seems to require
Palestinian agreement first, and that, at the moment, is not yet
available. The Palestinian leadership wants to hold presidential
elections instead of legislative elections, which I think is a mistake
because it makes it a lot more difficult to gain internal consensus on a
ceasefire. Those that are opposed to presidential elections or might not
gain from presidential elections, might fear there is a certain hidden
agenda on the part of the Palestinian Authority to avoid legislative
elections, and may make it impossible to hold elections by refusing to
abide by a cease-fire agreement.

Also, while Israel talks about Jerusalemites being able to vote in other
cities, this was not what was done in 1996, and I think Palestinians
will insist that Jerusalemites vote the same way they voted in 1996.

In addition, what will the Israelis do once a Palestinian ceasefire is
in place? Are they willing to evacuate the cities and remove the
checkpoints? All these questions are still hanging there.

I think there is a desire at the moment on the part of the Palestinian
Authority, the Israelis and the Americans to facilitate presidential
elections. But this is not the most important thing for us. I believe
that if we can hold presidential elections, we can certainly hold
legislative elections, and if we waste the opportunity to hold
legislative elections we would be making a big mistake.

Q: In other words you feel, like Hamas, that presidential
and legislative elections should be held on the same day?

A: Absolutely.
"
"Isr","Neut","Zeev Hever has served in recent years as head of the ""Amana"" movement,
the settlement arm of the Yesha Council (Council of the Communities in
Judea, Samaria and Gaza). Hever, nicknamed Zambish, is a close personal
friend of the prime minister of Israel. What do these two have in
common, with their quarter-century age differential? Simply this: Ariel
Sharon, despite his frequent involvement in financial improprieties, in
his heart of hearts likes and respects idealists who keep their distance
from financial issues and devote themselves entirely to the Jewish
people and to Zionist ideals. In his eyes Zambish symbolizes these ideals.

On December 16, two days before Sharon's Herzliya speech
                                               , Hever addressed the
press for the first time in years. It happened at Migron, the outpost
Sharon intends to dismantle. Hever, who is a kind of alter ego to Sharon
when it comes to Zionist ideals, declared that dismantling settlements
is a type of mental illness; a throwback to the Jews' spiritual ills
from Diaspora days, when they were submissive and sought only to grovel
to the lord of the land in 18th and 19th century Eastern Europe. There
could be no greater insult to the likes of Ariel Sharon, a
symbol--certainly in his own eyes--of the ""new Jew"", born on the land,
free of the complexes of ghetto Jews, who knows how to say a sharp ""no""
to the rulers of the world, i.e., to American presidents.

If Hever hoped to influence the contents of the Herzliya speech, he
failed. Sharon stated that he had made a commitment to President Bush to
""dismantle unauthorized outposts. It is my intention to implement this
commitment . . . Period."" Nor did he hesitate to commit to ""changing the
deployment"" of veteran settlements, not recently built outposts, as part
of a ""redeployment"" and unilateral disengagement. Member of Knesset Uri
Ariel, another old friend of Sharon, stated after the speech that the
very soldiers once dispatched by Sharon to fight at the front for the
Zionist ideal had now been shot by him in the back. And what is the
Zionist ideal if not settlement? This is a heavily loaded statement in
an Israel that has not yet recovered from the trauma of the Rabin
assassination. Prior to his election to the Knesset, Ariel was the
general secretary of the Yesha Council. The troika of Sharon-Ariel-Hever
had worked closely together on planning and implementing Jewish
settlement throughout Judea and Samaria.

Intelligence services near and far, and the political establishments in
Israel, the Arab states and the West are all busily trying to answer the
question: is this a new Sharon? Does he really mean to implement what he
presented in Herzliya? And if so, what are his motives? What caused such
an extreme metamorphosis in the earlier convictions of this much-admired
man? Most of all, though, it is the settlers--the people for whom Sharon
really was the man who enabled the fulfillment of their Zionist
ideals--who are agonizing over these questions. Many of them desperately
want to believe that this is but one more ""ploy"" of the sort Sharon
executed over the course of long years when he held central positions in
the life of the country, in the army and beyond.

My advice to my settler friends is to stop agonizing. If Zambish and Uri
Ariel, perhaps the closest people to Sharon other than his family and
immediate assistants, said what they said about Sharon, then something
has gone seriously wrong. Between loyalty to his ideals and to them on
the one hand, and keeping his promise to President Bush on the other,
Sharon chose Bush. Anyone who believes that unilateral redeployment will
increase terrorism--since the Palestinians will now believe that they
have broken the will even of Ariel Sharon--rather than reduce it; anyone
who believes that a State of Israel reduced to a crowded ghetto within
an area of 20,000 square kilometers is living on borrowed time; anyone
who thinks that the destruction of settlements is a mortal blow--from a
moral, ideological and human standpoint--to the very soul of Zionism,
must take his/her place at the forefront of the non-violent struggle to
thwart Ariel Sharon's plans.

This week, for eight days, the Jewish people celebrate Hanukkah,
commemorating the Jewish victory over the Greeks. More than 2,100 years
ago the Jews revolted against the Greeks who had conquered their land. A
considerable portion of the Jews opposed the revolt, preferring to
collaborate with the Greeks--people of culture, rulers of the world in
their day. They were called ""Hellenizers"". In the end the victors were
those known as ""zealots""--today known as ""settlers"". What is certain is
that the Hellenizers, who had tired of the struggle against the Greeks
and were enchanted by Greek culture, slowly abandoned their people and
their country, just like the old elites of today who seek to integrate
with globalization, particularly of the American variety. In contrast,
the sons and daughters of the zealots sustained the generational chain
of Judaism, and it is thanks to them that there exists today a Jewish
people who returned, after some 1,900 years of exile, to reestablish a
state in their land.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What was your impression of Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon's ""disengagement plan""
                                               ?

A: Sharon was giving the Palestinians an ultimatum: ""either you
accept my roadmap                                                  with
the 14 alterations injected by my government (and this is the maximum
that you will get out of me) or we are going to unilaterally give you
less than that. The choice is yours--if you opt for negotiations, I can
give you more, but you should know (and this is a tacit understanding)
that the most you will get even then is the most that is offered in 'my
roadmap', which includes only the land inside the wall.""

Q: Why this proposal now?

A: First, I don't think that Sharon is changing his ideology,
but practically, there are many things that he wants to take into
account. He wants to please the American administration, but he also
wants to use this time during which the American administration is
entering an election campaign to push for his own interests. He also
wants to send a message to Israeli society because he was criticized
internally for having no plan. Third, he wants to kill the Geneva accord.

I think that Sharon has reached the conclusion--and this might be the
one item that he has changed his mind about--that after wanting all of
""Eretz Israel"" to become a Jewish state and advocating for a long time
for the expulsion of Palestinians, their physical transfer is
impossible. Now, instead of a practical transfer, he wants to implement
the ""legal transfer"" of Palestinians. Legal transfer means that while we
will live inside ""Eretz Israel"", we will not be part of the state of
Israel, meaning we will not reach a situation of apartheid and
Palestinians will no longer be able to opt for one state.

Basically, he has in mind that part of the West Bank will be
incorporated into the state of Israel. The wall is the marker; it is not
a security barrier, but the border. Put the Palestinians in cantons and
let them call that a state, but that state will not be sovereign, will
not be independent. If Palestinians accept this through negotiations,
then Sharon is ready to give it to them. If they do not, then he is
going to remove the Israeli military presence from small areas and sit
tight until Palestinians agree to return to his plan, which he will
disguise under the roadmap. The second stage of the roadmap calls for a
temporary state; this is the temporary state made permanent.

Q: Why did the meeting between prime ministers Sharon
and Ahmed Qurei' never happen?

A: From a Palestinian perspective, why should it happen? I don't
understand why the Palestinian prime minister would go and meet with
Sharon, especially after his speech. The Palestinian reaction to the
speech was that we reject unilateral actions. A meeting with Sharon now
means that we accept negotiations instead. The question is, on what
basis? On his roadmap and the 14 qualifications? The greatest thing that
Sharon gained from this ultimatum is that his roadmap will become
legitimate and will become the maximum Palestinians can achieve.

Q: In this situation, what can the Palestinian
Authority do?

A: I think that the best way to face Sharon's ultimatum is not
to meet with him, but to offer him and Israel a Palestinian ultimatum in
return. The Palestinian ultimatum would be:

""We know that you want to squeeze us into cantons and thereby cheat us
and the world of the two-state solution. We agree to a two-state
solution--we have indicated this for a long time--but that two-state
solution must be based on the 1967 borders, give and take minor
exchanges. As such, we are giving you a few months (maybe six months)
and as a measure of trust, we will offer you a Palestinian truce [during
that time]. If, however, the wall continues to be built and the
settlement expansion policy continues in these six months, then we will
understand that you are closing the gates to a two-state solution.

""If so, then we will accommodate you. In that case, we are going to
close the two-state option forever, and from then on, we will pursue the
establishment of just one state. Further, from then on, you will have to
bear the consequences of your occupation. We will dissolve the
Palestinian Authority and you won't have the Authority there to cripple
with your actions, even as you blame it morning and night. Then you will
have to deal with the Palestinian people, meeting us on equal terms 20
or 30 years from now when there is one vote for every person.

""The meaning of all of this is that if you are afraid of the political
effects of demography, then we are going to use it against you. Beware.""

Q: What are the dangers of this approach?

A: Any plan should have its alternative built in, and this
requires more discussion among Palestinians. We should tell Sharon that
if he doesn't accept the two-state solution [in order] to separate from
us, then we will give him more of us. To give Israel more of us means
that we have to dissolve the Palestinian Authority.

In order for the Palestinians to get a fully sovereign, independent
state on the 1967 borders, Palestinians should use the only thing that
Israel and Israelis are afraid of, i.e. the political effects of the
demographic factor. Thus, the one-state solution is the medium for
gaining the two-state solution. Now the question is, will the Authority
dissolve itself? That is the question that remains to be answered.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: If Israel had built the fence closer to the green line
from the start, could it have prevented the current proceedings of the
International Court of Justice at The Hague?

A: I think that if we did not put the fence exactly on the green
line the Palestinians would have tried anyhow.

Q: Will the Palestinian suicide bus bombing of February 22,
2004 in Jerusalem affect The Hague proceedings?

A: That terrorist act has put the proceedings in The Hague into
the proper context from the Israeli point of view. What we want is to
prevent terrorism and what happened in Jerusalem proves that if there is
no fence, there is terror.

Q: Israel is moving the fence toward the green line
precisely when the court is meeting. Doesn't this signal that Israel
somehow recognizes the court's jurisdiction?

A: There was a lively discussion in the government on this
subject. The minister of defense said that the timing was coincidental
and not connected to The Hague. But this doesn't tell the entire story.
When the proceedings at The Hague have concluded, I may voice some
opinions differing from those of the government with regard to the path
of the fence, in order to reduce disturbance to civilian life. But in
principle we have the right to put the fence wherever our lives are in
danger.

Q: Do you believe the cases currently pending before the
Israel High Court of Justice regarding the fence could affect The Hague
court decision?

A: They certainly will affect the decisions of the Israeli
government. We reject the jurisdiction of The Hague court but accept
what our own court says.

Q: Israel decided not to appear at the hearing in The
Hague. Yet the government of Israel has encouraged the Jewish Agency and
various NGOs to demonstrate.

A: I believe we should reject the jurisdiction of the court, but
that if it doesn't accept our view we should appear. But the Cabinet
decided against my view. As for the demonstrations in The Hague, we
learned the lessons of [the anti-racism conference in] Durban, where the
pro-Palestinian forces took over the street.

Q: What is Israel's best-case outcome at The Hague?
Worst-case outcome?

A: The best case would be that the court says it has no
jurisdiction on such a political subject. The worst case is a negative
opinion to the United Nations
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What will be in your presentation?

A: I don't believe that it is appropriate to talk about what we
will be discussing before the court until it is made public.
Nevertheless, generally speaking we will be focusing on the obligations
of an occupying power to the occupied people and how Israel violated
those obligations.

Q: Would the Palestinians agree if the wall was built along
the green line?

A: We would prefer not to have a wall at all. Our idea of peace
is one without walls and borders. Nevertheless, if Israel wanted to
build a wall on the green line, that is certainly within its right. It
does not, however, have the right to build it within occupied territory
and in such a way that violates the rights of the occupied people whom
Israel is obligated to protect and not harm.

Q: What is the best result that you can hope for from the
hearings in The Hague?

A: Well, the International Court of Justice in The Hague has been
asked to provide an advisory opinion for guidance to member states. So
the real question is not what The Hague will say but what the member
states are going to do to actually implement whatever the court advises.
That is where I hope that states would change their policies and
actually adopt whatever the court rules.

Q: Is there a precedent for this action?

A: It is one of the main mandates of the court to provide
advisory opinions when asked by the General Assembly, which it has done.
This is certainly within the court's mandate and within their
jurisdiction. They have never turned down a request to give an advisory
opinion.

Q: The Israelis are saying the international court has no
right to pass down an opinion. This is murmured by the Americans and the
Europeans as well. What do they base that opinion on?

A: That is not the position of the Europeans and the Americans.
You have not seen the European and American submissions. Please don't
believe whatever the Israelis tell you with respect to the US and EU
positions. I think you should wait until you see that. I can say that I
don't know if there is a single country other than Israel that approves
of the wall in the fashion that it is being built.

Israel's view is that no law applies to it. It has never abided by
international law. Israel has taken the view that it can do whatever it
wants with impunity. Unfortunately, that is the international
community's fault. It has taught Israel that international legal
standards do not apply to it. Hopefully, this will be the beginning of a
change in that policy.

Q: What issue is really at stake here?

A: I think we should focus on the fact that this is not a
question of the wall per se, and Israel's right to build a wall, but a
question of the legal consequences of Israel building the wall in
occupied territory in such a way that violates the rights of the
occupied people. The importance of this hearing is that is re-injects
and reaffirms that this not a conflict between two equal parties who
simply have to negotiate. This is an issue between occupier and occupied
and we seem to have forgotten that. This is not a conflict between two
equal parties with equal negotiating leverage. You should not forget
that as an occupier, Israel is subject to international legal standards
which it has violated.

"Isr","Neut","Not only is the roadmap                                                 
teetering on the edge of death, but the Quartet that was created to
promote this latest Arab-Israeli peace effort is also close to
disintegration. Instead of the promised harmony, the members continue
their solo performances and each seeks the spotlight. While European
officials are making pilgrimages to Yasir Arafat's headquarters in
Ramallah, United States officials meet Palestinian Prime Minister
Mahmoud Abbas in Jericho. And the faces of European Union leaders such
as Javier Solana and George Papandreou, as well as perennial United
Nations representative Terje Roed-Larsen, were all missing from the
group photos of the Sharm al-Sheikh and Aqaba summits. Like Arafat, the
Quartet watched the show, conducted by President Bush, on television.

Indeed the Quartet, like the roadmap, had a very inauspicious debut,
demonstrating that the core issues that contributed to the catastrophic
end of Oslo have not been resolved. During the Oslo phase, often
competing policies of the US and Europe caused confusion and allowed the
main actors to seek better terms by shuffling between the two main
mediators. Now, amidst the deep fractures between the US and ""Old""
Europe over Iraq, and Israeli anger over European paternalism and
betrayal of democratic principles (amplified in the UN), the prospects
of a useful role for the Quartet are essentially zero.

The violence that followed the introduction of the roadmap was, in part,
the result of the flawed Quartet framework. British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's determination to publish the text immediately after the defeat
of Saddam Hussein prevented Mahmoud Abbas from wresting control over the
security apparatus from Arafat. Blair felt he needed a quick release in
order to appease constituencies angered by the British position on the
Iraq war. This gave Arafat enough power to sabotage Israeli-Palestinian
security coordination, and, according to reports, to dispatch terrorists
from his muqata'a headquarters.

At the same time, the premature presentation of this initiative ensured
that Abbas would remain weak. The various factions, including Hamas,
were thus invited to try their luck in destabilizing the new Palestinian
government and the roadmap process. The results included the murder of
four soldiers guarding the highly symbolic Erez crossing (where
Palestinians enter Israel to work), followed by an Israeli targeted
attack against a Hamas leader, and then the very brutal bus bombing in
Jerusalem. Together, these initial but readily predictable failures may
be fatal for the roadmap.

In terms of meeting the difficult challenges of implementing the roadmap
on the ground, the EU appears to have little to offer. European leaders,
as well as UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, again denounced the terror
attacks by Hamas, and issued more ritual calls to end the violence, as
if such statements had any impact whatsoever. In contrast, President
Bush increased the level of his direct involvement, reversing his
initial stand and accepting Israeli actions to end terrorism conducted
by Hamas. The US also threatened to take action against countries that
provide assistance to terror groups, while the EU could only hint in the
vaguest terms regarding possible sanctions against Hamas. And as the
Americans belatedly dispatched the initial monitoring group, and forced
resumption of the Israeli and Palestinian security talks in a desperate
hope to save the roadmap, Europe and the UN remained on the sidelines,
without influence on such critical steps.

From an Israeli perspective, the main rationale for the Quartet is to
keep the other three actors from interfering with the policies pursued
by the Americans. The Israeli view of the EU has become increasingly
bitter, based on the European adoption of the Palestinian narrative,
focusing on ""settlement, occupation and victimization"" (as if the
conflict began in 1967). Europeans and the UN are seen to pander to
growing Muslim populations and oil dependency, at Israel's expense.
Anti-Semitism and paternalism (particularly from the French) still play
a role and, in contrast to the US, Europe puts little emphasis on norms
such as democracy and freedom. In the entire Oslo period and well
beyond, the EU never halted the flow of funds to the Palestinian
Authority despite its corruption and direct involvement in terror, and
the investigation demanded by the EU's parliament is being conducted in
secret. And finally, Israelis realize that while the other members of
the Quartet will advocate ""painful concessions"" and risk-taking for
Israel, only the US will assist Israel if and when such policies go
badly wrong.

These problems were reflected in the first disastrous days of the
roadmap's life. It is now clear that only the full force of ""Pax
Americana"", without petty political competition from its ""partners"", may
be able to create some stability. Perhaps by banging enough heads
together, the Americans may force the disarming of Hamas and force the
PA to ensure that it has a monopoly on the use of force, as necessary
for any proto-state. If they succeed, this could also set the stage for
beginning the deep changes necessary for transforming the conflict. For
their part, the other three members of the Quartet need to examine their
roles and past failures more critically, while avoiding contributing to
the failure of another peace process, and to more violence and murder.
"
"Pal","Neut","Dear Members of the Quartet,

Let me tell you about our West Bank village of Jayyus. By last July, we
knew that Israel had already mapped out the course of the separation
wall in Qalqilya District, but we had not yet seen the plans. Then one
September evening, a shepherd found white sheets of paper tacked to the
olive trees. He brought them to me, and I saw that they were military
orders handwritten in Arabic. The order said that all of the farmers of
Jayyus village were to come to their farms, where a military officer
from the nearby settlement of Qadumim would show us the path of the
wall. We thought that the Israeli military might confiscate 50 or 100
square meters--no more. But 200 farmers showed up that unbelievable day
to hear that the wall would be built six kilometers inside the Green
Line, what we consider the political border with Israel. Many of the
farmers were weeping.

I have worked all my life to build my farm, which stretches over 192
dunams. My orchards are full of loquats and avocados, mangos and
peaches, walnuts and figs. I have the richest land in Jayyus.

But that Wednesday, I learned that 175 dunams of my land, the best and
well-irrigated earth, was to fall on the other side of the separation
wall. To get to it, I would have to circumvent barbed wire, electronic
censors, military patrols and an eight-meter high cement barrier.
Without those resources, I knew I would be a beggar.

And so we began our peaceful demonstrations. With international
supporters, we farmers sat in the path of the bulldozers to try to
prevent the uprooting of our olive trees. Many Israelis from the peace
camp and Jews from America and Europe came, too. One day, we were
sitting in the road when an Israeli army officer came and asked us why.
We told him that it would be better for them to kill us than to uproot
our olive trees.

""We are constructing the separation wall to prevent attacks between
Israelis and Palestinians and--in the end--for peace,"" he replied.

I said to him politely, ""I represent Jayyus village. I am ready to pay
half of the cost of constructing this wall, if you would only build it
on the Green Line. If you have no security now, how do you expect to get
it when you are 28 meters from our homes?"" He became very angry, and
said, ""I want to show you something."" He put his arm on my neck and then
under my shoulders, as if to whisper in my ear, but I could feel his arm
wrenching painfully against my neck bones.

This land was my father's land and that of his father before him. We
have already lost land to the settlement of Zofin, which was established
in 1988. The dust from a nearby Israeli quarry--also a
settlement--collects on the leaves of my fruit trees. But it is only
because of the earth's wealth that I have been able to educate all of my
seven children. I have four daughters: one economist, two English
literature majors and a third who will graduate in physics. My sons
include an electrical engineer, a lawyer and an agricultural engineer.
This last son, Muhammad, breaks my heart. He won honors in school and a
scholarship to study medicine in Tunisia. But when Muhammad called me
from abroad, I spoke to him of my sadness that none of my children would
care for my farm. He quit his program and returned to the West Bank to
study agriculture. Now we will lose our farm and I wonder every day,
what gift have I given my son?

The bulldozers work on the wall 24 hours a day. Israeli patrols run
incessantly past our home and we do not sleep for the noise. The village
of Jayyus is home to 550 families, 400 of which depend entirely on
agriculture. Often, when we go to work the land, the military stops us
to ask for our identification papers. Israel says that we will continue
to have access to our farms, but no one really knows what the future
holds. North of Tulkarem, the farmers were told this, too, but to this
day they are barred from their farms. I have advised all of the Jayyus
farmers to live on their land, because if that is lost, we will have
nothing.

During the Aqaba summit, the Land Defense Committee of Qalqilya came to
Ramallah and set up a tent in front of the office of Prime Minister
Mahmoud Abbas. We established this tent because we wanted the world to
know that we are the new refugees (as if there are not enough refugees
and tents in the Arab world). Since 1980, the settlements have been
annexing our land bit by bit, and I worry that soon we will be no better
than Thai and Filipino workers in Israel--day laborers on our own stolen
land. We told Abu Mazen that this land is as holy for us as Jerusalem,
and that we will not exchange it for even the best of that city.

My message to you, the Quartet, is a simple one: to ask you to pressure
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to treat us as human beings. If he
could only respect Palestinians as humans, he would stop annexing our
land, he would stop arresting our sons and he would release all our
prisoners.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: You led the campaign in the Likud Central Committee to
reject Labor as a coalition partner. Is this only because of Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon's disengagement plan?

A: Our rejection of Labor is not just with respect to
disengagement. Labor joining the government would mean a dramatic change
in the government's economic and growth stimulation policy. In the
political and security context it would mean first, as Labor states,
that disengagement in Gaza and northern Samaria would be just the
beginning, they would press for additional evacuation of the rest of the
settlements in Judea and Samaria and Jerusalem and a return to the 1967
lines that Abba Eban once described as Auschwitz borders. Secondly,
Labor joining would mean a change in the policy of combating terrorism.
[Labor leader Shimon] Peres opposed the targeted killing of Ahmed
Yassin, the Hamas leader. So this would be an unacceptable and negative
change.

Q: Shinui also favors disengagement and renewing
negotiations. Why not seek to remove it too from the coalition?

A: Shinui is more of a moderate party than Labor. A year ago
[then Labor leader Amram] Mitzna proposed unilateral disengagement;
Shinui was against it. Since then they've endorsed the Sharon version of
disengagement, but they have a different agenda from Labor.

Q: What is your alternative? Are you implying that you
accept limited disengagement, but without Labor?

A: I haven't suggested limited disengagement. I'm not opposed to
compromise when it comes to final peace. Our opposition to disengagement
is because when you're in a war you want to win the war and dismantle
the terrorist organizations. We have [US President George W.] Bush's
support for this position. Only after that is it time to speak about
concessions. Now is not the time to speak about compromise. I claim
Judea and Samaria as my homeland. When peacetime comes we'll discuss it.

Q: What, indeed, is your vision of an Israeli-Palestinian
peace agreement?

A: It's premature to speak of a more detailed approach. One
precondition is the total dismantling of terrorism and replacing the
current Palestinian Authority by something new, a leadership that can
speak freely of peace with us. Then there must be an interim period of
3-5 years, with US, European and perhaps Arab help, to develop a new
framework of a future Palestinian entity and democratic rules for
electing its leadership and developing a way to live side by side, day
by day.

Q: Turning briefly to the fence, Sharon appears to be
moving it back toward the green line, under pressure from the courts and
the international community.

A: Of course I'm against a fence creeping to the green line; it
has no security logic, only left wing logic. I've no problem with
Sharon's original concept, which had nothing to do with politics.
Incidentally, I'm the first minister who called for a fence to stop
terrorism and the ongoing influx of Palestinians across the green line.
The fence would have been on a security line, not the green line. It is
a mistake on our part not to appeal again to the High Court of Justice
and make clear that its decision is a major mistake, that it has invaded
an area of reasoning that should be the privilege of the government.

Q: Having dealt a blow to Sharon's plans for a
disengagement coalition, how do you view his options?

A: I don't know what option he'll choose. But political reality
must be a major factor influencing him. The majority of the Likud
constituencies and central committee members made it clear that Labor
should not be in, though not because we delegitimize Labor and its
policies. I simple reject the attempt to turn the Likud into Labor.

I think the present coalition can continue to rule and can be enhanced,
relying on the stabilizing tools regarding constructive no confidence
votes [that the Knesset instituted a few years ago]. In this way the
Likud would follow the mandate received from its constituency.

Q: Repeated Likud governments have suffered from schisms on
their right wing that have ultimately led to their electoral defeat. Is
that what we're seeing now?

A: A schism now could weaken the right. I hope this will not be
the case and that we will learn the lessons of the past. We have a great
responsibility. A good part of our struggle is within the realm of
democratic norms of government and party behavior in a democratic
country. This is not just [a matter of] Sharon accepting party
decisions. There was a clear Likud election commitment not to disengage
unilaterally and to compromise only at the peace negotiating table after
we've won the fight against terrorism. Now Sharon wants to do what
Mitzna promised. He rejects the Likud referendum decisions and [those of
the] central committee, the supreme organ of the Likud.

In our central committee the majority eventually chose not to give into
the pressure of the party apparatus even though it's easier to go along
with the power of those who lead the party. For me this is a great hope
in a time when more and more in our political arena are motivated by
different interests. I heard [Yahad Party leader] Yossi Beilin speak in
similar terms: in a democracy you have to follow the decisions of your
party institutions. These are the democratic rules of the game you have
to follow.
"
"Pal","Neut","It seems that the repeated rebuffs Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
is getting from members of his Likud Party will affect his political
course. The lack of support for his Gaza withdrawal plan will ultimately
weaken his ability to move ahead with it, especially after he has
realized that his opponents are more numerous than expected.

Sharon's overtures to the Labor Party were a key factor in the success
or otherwise of the withdrawal plan, and the Likud vote against Labor
joining the government will have a huge impact on Sharon's agenda in
this regard.

While Sharon is set to try to carry on regardless--believing that, as
polls indicate, the Israeli public supports a pullout from Gaza, and
that his standing in the international arena will also improve, having
convinced the United States in particular he can indeed carry through
such a withdrawal--it is hard to see that this time he can ignore the
most important institutions of his party.

Sharon's opponents, the so-called Likud ""rebels,"" realize that if Sharon
succeeds in bringing Labor into the government he would automatically
get the support of the majority of members of the government and the
Knesset without having to convince or appease his opponents in the
Likud. In other words, the party would lose its ability to affect the
decision-making process of the government. Hence their opposition to a
coalition government was strong and blunt, arguing that Labor would push
for the establishment of a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders and
restore President Yasser Arafat's political activity, something
unacceptable to the Likud rank-and-file.

Thus Sharon is in a bind. If he disregards the result of the Likud vote
and continues his efforts to bring Labor into the government and
actually succeeds in overriding the opposition in the Likud, he would
find himself severed from his own party in every sense with consequent
grave risks to his political future.

On the other hand, if Sharon heeds his party's decision, he would be
unable to carry out his unilateral withdrawal, even with a majority vote
in the government and Knesset, because ultimately he would have to go
back to the Likud to approve the evacuation of Gaza Strip settlements,
which is highly unlikely.

And a coalition formed without Labor, based for example on the Likud,
Shinui, fundamentalist parties and others, would be equally problematic
given the influence of the settler movement in some of those parties.
That is, if such a coalition could get off the ground given Shinui's
opposition to joining a coalition without Labor.

On the Palestinian side, some factions, in particular Hamas, will be
happy with the Likud vote, which, in addition to their general
opposition to Sharon's unilateral plan, they also believe supports their
view that the current Israeli government is not interested in peace.

Hamas has long declared its opposition to Sharon's plan, which it
considers political deception, and has tried to convince the Egyptians
and the Palestinian Authority not to work with it. Having failed in this
effort, Hamas made do with offering its views on the subject, on the
future of the Strip and on its own possible political participation in
administering the Strip. But on this latter issue, and on the armed
resistance, Hamas suspended any final decision until the movement saw
the extent of the Israeli withdrawal.

This was despite Egypt's efforts to persuade Hamas not to stand in the
way of any possible withdrawal. Egypt, now, also finds itself in a jam.
The Likud vote has made Egyptian efforts to convince skeptical
Palestinian factions of any advantage accruing from a unilateral Israeli
withdrawal even more problematic. For as long as Sharon cannot give them
a clear position, they have nothing to argue with.

In short, the political reality is such that Sharon will not be able to
move ahead with his withdrawal plan, something that will suit Hamas,
increase their popularity, and convince the majority of Palestinians
that Israel is not really interested in evacuating settlements and
occupied territory. In turn this may affect the Palestinian Authority,
which with little else in the cards may be forced into accepting a
national government comprising all the factions.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: How will a war in Iraq affect the elections in Israel?

A: Voters will go to the polls thinking about the Iraqi issue and
relations with the US. The closer we are to war, the more
security-minded the atmosphere will be.

Q: What sort of governmental coalition would you like to see
after the elections?

A: A coalition with three goals: it will agree to enter negotiations
with the Palestinians immediately; it will agree to a Palestinian state;
and it will agree to change the electoral system by raising the
threshold for entering the Knesset. It will be centrist, built around
the two big parties, otherwise it won't have a majority. And it won't be
dependent on the religious parties and the settlers. It will separate
religion from politics. The alternative is a right wing coalition that's
dependent on the settlers.

Q: You are in effect pointing to the centrality of the
settlements. What is your solution for them following elections?

A: Comprehensive dismantling of settlements only in the Gaza Strip.
Everywhere else it's complicated, and I suggest three principles:
removing isolated settlements; concentrating settlements in the
settlement blocs, including land swaps with the Palestinians; and anyone
who does not wish to leave a settlement or move to a bloc, will be
permitted to remain under Palestinian rule, with Israel ensuring their
safety.

Q: Will the conquest of Iraq by the United States bring about
realization of your vision of a New Middle East?

A: After World War II, the central problem was communism. Today it's
terrorism. The distinction favors communism, because it was never as
aggressive as terrorism. It's not that America is attacking terrorism;
terrorism attacked America. This is not a war in the sense of army vs.
army, but rather of organizing against terrorism. It is Iraq's proximity
to nuclear weaponry that put it at the head of the list of objectives.

The question is whether the US will do the job alone or in harmony. I
don't see a possibility of American failure in Iraq; the US is on the
defensive and has no alternative. The discussion is whether the
international reaction should only involve the war on terrorism, or the
denial of infrastructure to terrorism as well. You can't eliminate
terrorism without eliminating the infrastructure.

Q: As you understand the Americans, this is what they intend
to do?

A: Not really, but I think they'll get to it, and that the conquest
of Iraq will really create a New Middle East. Put differently: the
Middle East will enter a new age. For the time being this will happen
without us, as long as there's no Palestinian solution.

Many peoples in the region are ruled by frightened dictators who have to
decide whom to fear more, the terrorists or the war against terrorism.
Asad fears for his legitimacy due to the war against terrorism. Arafat
can also lose his legitimacy. The Saudis gave money for terrorism due to
fear. No terrorist-sponsoring country is democratic. I don't believe in
Huntington's clash of civilizations; within every civilization there's a
clash. In those countries [that support terrorism] there will be
revolutions. Television will play a role like in the collapse of the
Iron Curtain. This will happen with the Palestinians, too. The Arab
world is ripe for internal revolution like the USSR and China in the
past decade.

Q: What will happen to the peace process in the post-war
circumstances you have described?

A: There will be three actors: us, the Palestinians and the Quartet.
We won't be able to play the powers off against one another any more.
After Iraq the Americans have no alternative but to cooperate with the
Quartet. Two things happened here. On the positive side, the nature of
the solution is more or less known. On the negative, trust has
disappeared. This brings us to the Quartet's task. Unlike others, I
don't think the Quartet should send the military here, but rather should
grant financial assistance and legitimize a different Palestinian regime
in which Arafat can remain if he's not the ultimate arbiter. [Prime
Minister Ariel] Sharon's decision to accept the Bush Plan will backfire
on him. If Arik doesn't see the realities he won't remain prime minister.

Q: You are as optimistic as ever.

A: Look, there are no national strategies any longer. There's only
national poverty. With the global economy there are only global
strategies. We're moving from a world of enemies that are national to a
world of global dangers. Can you place boundaries on pollution? We in
Israel are also living in the past. In 1965 I came out with the slogan
""scientification of the country."" They laughed at me: ""That Peres with
his dreams again."" And look at us today. . .
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: When the Palestinian leadership looks past the Israeli
elections and the war on Iraq, what does it see ahead?

A: We would like to see a road to peace. What seems to be the major
obstacle now to stopping the confrontations and ending the occupation is
the specter of the war on Iraq and the elections in Israel on January
28. With these two on, the Americans have retreated from the position of
putting the road plan in force, and with these two on, there seems to be
little likelihood that there will be a major advance for peace.

After that, we are really hoping that things will change and that the
dynamics in Israel will be such as to push for peace; the dynamics in
Palestinian society doing the same; and the international community
applying more pressure to get the peace process moving. At least this is
our hope.

Q: When members of the Palestinian Authority get together
and think strategically about how best to pursue those goals, what are
the key things you work on?

A: We are working on things that we can control now. We are working
on the constitution; we are working on Palestinian reform; we are
pursuing a dialogue with Hamas to stop all violence between [Palestinian
factions] and stop all violence against civilians; we are engaged in a
process of persuading the rest of the Arab world and international
community to keep the hope alive and to push the American-sponsored
roadmap.

We are also engaged in at least some form of dialogue with at last some
Israelis. This is tricky because the more we engage in that dialogue,
the more it can create some negative effects among those in Israel who
would use this against these peace supporters. So, as much as we would
obviously like to see winning the elections the coalition that supports
peace and end to occupation, we have a limitation to how much we can
advocate this without embarrassing the Israeli parties.

Q: Can you say who those parties are?

A: Well, they are obviously parties within the pro-peace camp in
the Labor party and in Meretz.

Q: What do you think right now is the Palestinian
Authority's biggest worry for the coming months?

A: We are worried very much about the Israeli extreme right, which
is now quite powerful within the present Israeli government, [and may]
try to use the war on Iraq as a pretext for escalation against the
Palestinian people, such as a full occupation of Gaza, an attempt to
transfer Palestinians out of Jerusalem, or out of Palestine altogether.
We are afraid that the Israeli government and the Israeli extreme right
will try to push aside the minimum constraints in the Geneva Convention
by claiming that the Palestinians are just part of Al Qaeda, they are
doing what Osama bin Ladin did in New York, just painting us with the
Taliban picture and discounting any [Israeli] commitments as an occupier
to the Geneva convention.

Q: How close do you think that we are to this scenario?

A: We are not far. The present government includes many people who
support this ideologically and are not hiding their orientation. Within
the Israeli security agencies and the army, there are those who are
trying to operationally translate ideologies into specific action.

However, I have received assurances everywhere I went that this is not
going to be tolerated. Mainly from Mr. Powell himself, very clearly and
very adamantly, and also from Joschka Fisher, Jack Straw, President
Chirac and others. The world cannot possibly look aside if this happens.
Therefore, even though there is great risk, I am not really an alarmist.

Q: If Ariel Sharon does win the Israeli elections, do you
think that negotiations are possible with his government?

A: From our point of view, we are ready. We have been ready; we
have never taken the position that we decide who is the Israeli partner.
But if the question is posed differently--do you think that the Israeli
party led by Sharon is really ready to go to elections and willing to
make these elections lead to real peace?--I say that I am really
skeptical that that is going to happen, especially with what looks like
the ""new line"" of the Likud party and the kind of partners Likud will have.

Not unless there is a real commitment by the Americans will anything
push that kind of government to go back to real negotiations leading to
peace. It is not impossible, but highly improbably.

Q: What is your message to the Israeli people, then, on
the eve of elections?

A: We Israelis and Palestinians both need to position ourselves as
clearly and as early as possible to regain the peace process and regain
the process of negotiations, guided this time by clear objectives and
less manipulative ways of delaying forever the inevitable.

Second, I think that we should both act as clearly as possible against
escalation, particularly against civilians--be they Palestinian or
Israeli civilians--in order to reduce the wounds between our two people.
This is a goal that needs to be pushed and supported by the Israeli
people, as much as the Palestinian people.

Peace--it is inevitable that we will get back to it. So let us keep our
contacts, our relations, our hopes and our visions directed to the life
after this confrontation and not be consumed by the confrontation. Let
us move into action that will put both our efforts in the right
direction.
"
"Isr","Neut","The green line, the boundary separating Israel from the West Bank, has
retained its significance in all the negotiations concerning the
demarcation of a boundary for a future Palestinian State. At the most,
it is possible that the green line will be modified to take into account
some of the Israeli settlements which are in close proximity to the
line. But despite the many geographical changes which have taken place
around the line during the course of the past 35 years, it is still
perceived by many policymakers as the default line for future boundary
demarcation.

The green line was drawn up at the Rhodes Armistice talks in 1948-49.
The precise demarcation of the line reflected the military realities of
the time following the Israel's War of Independence. The implementation
of the boundary gave rise to numerous functional problems for
Arab-Palestinian villages and townships. Some Arab residents of the
region became Israeli citizens, while others became stateless under
Jordanian administration. Many villages on the West Bank side of the
boundary were cut off from their fields on the Israeli side. Others were
no longer able to travel beyond the new boundary to their jobs in places
such as Jaffa, Ramla and Lod, thus causing substantial economic
dislocation for many of the Arab inhabitants.

The ""opening"" of the boundary in 1967 brought about a new geographic
orientation. During the 1970s and 1980s, tens of thousands of
Palestinians from the West Bank crossed the boundary to work inside
Israel, as did Israeli settlers who retained their jobs in the Israeli
cities. In the other direction, many Israelis crossed the line,
especially on weekends and holidays, to shop in the markets of Qalqilya
and East Jerusalem and to use other services (such as dentists and car
mechanics) which were offered at a considerably cheaper price than
inside Israel itself.

Despite these trans-boundary movements, the line remained an important
point of separation between the two territories. Since no Israeli
government attempted to annex any part of the West Bank, the green line
retained its administrative functions, with the legal status of the
residents on both sides of the ""non-existent"" line remaining separate
and subject to Israeli and Jordanian law respectively.

These functional realities contrasted strongly with the public
statements made by many Israeli politicians to the effect that the green
line no longer existed--a policy reflected in the decision not to show
the green line on maps of Israel issued by the Surveyors Department or
in atlases used in Israeli schools and universities.

Neither did the creation of regional councils for the benefit of the
Israeli settlements in the West Bank tamper with the existing
administrative divide. Even where it would have seemed to be more
logical to annex some of the settlements to municipal authorities on the
Israeli side of the line, this did not take place as it would have
signaled the extension of Israeli civilian law to the occupied
territories, an act which is strictly forbidden under international law.

With the return of violence following the first Intifada beginning in
1987, the green line became even more apparent. Whenever curfews or
closures were imposed on the occupied territories, the road blocks were
established at those points which had been the boundary. As Palestinians
were gradually prevented from entering the Israeli market place, it was
the green line which determined the point beyond which they were no
longer allowed to move. For Israelis, the apprehension of traveling in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip created a geography of fear in which people
no longer crossed the green line. It may not always have been clearly
marked on the maps, but most Israelis developed an intuitive
understanding of just where the boundary was and ceased to travel beyond
the line.

The recent construction of walls and fences along parts of the West Bank
has taken place in close proximity to the green line (with deviations
which include some Israeli settlements on the Israeli side of the
fence), thus creating, de facto, a physical barrier which may yet prove
to be the future boundary separating Israel from a Palestinian state.

For its part, the line separating the Gaza Strip from Israel has
remained permanent and has, for the past 10 years, been enclosed by a
fence clearly demarcating the limits of this region. In the Jerusalem
area, it is the municipal boundaries of the city, as determined by the
Israeli government after 1967, which define the course of the boundary,
although this may change even further in the lead up to renewed
negotiations, as the government attempts to draw surrounding Jewish
communities (especially Ma'aleh Adumim) into the Jerusalem municipal area.

The history of the green line is testament to the powerful impact of
arbitrary and artificial boundaries, even over a relatively short period
of time. It served as a political line of separation--between Israel and
the Jordanian administered territories--for no more than 18 years, half
the time that has passed since it was ""opened"" in 1967. Yet, its
retention as a line of administrative separation, coupled with the
events of the past decade during which it has re-emerged as a barrier
preventing movement of people and goods in both directions, have only
strengthened its impact. If, and when, a political resolution of the
conflict is reached, the green line--with some minor deviations--has the
greatest likelihood of constituting the formal international boundary
between two independent states.
"
"Pal","Neut","To truly understand the nature of the ""green line"" in contemporary
political and legal discourse, one must first indulge in a bit of
historical memory.

In 1949, the state of Israel was admitted to the United Nations under
the condition that it accept United Nations resolutions 181 and 194.
Resolution 181, the United Nations Partition Plan, had in 1947 allotted
a newly-created Jewish state with 57 percent of the land (although Jews
were then only 33 percent of the Palestine population). When the Arab
states opposed the partition of land they saw as solely their own, the
1948 War commenced.

The aftermath of that war found the Zionist militia in control of an
expanded 77 percent of the land, and hundreds of thousands of
Palestinian refugees displaced from their homes. The remaining 23
percent of mandatory Palestine was under Egyptian and Jordanian control.
These armistice lines are what we refer to today as the ""green line.""
Nowhere are these borders codified into international law as border
lines (""blue lines""); the Rhodes agreements of 1949 set them as the
ceasefire lines between Israel and the Arab states.

Even so, the ""green line"" has become the major demarcation used in
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. Acceptance of this terminology has had
immense political ramifications for the Palestinian cause, the most
important being that it destroyed the international legal framework of
the Partition Plan and established Palestinian acceptance for boundaries
created through belligerent acts. International law does not allow the
acquisition of land by force, a principle repeated in numerous UN
resolutions concerning the Palestinian problem.

Examine, for instance, the peace agreements between Israel and other
Arab states. Agreements between Egypt and Israel in 1979, and Jordan and
Israel in 1994, were both based on ""blue lines,"" the boundaries between
historical Mandate Palestine and the relevant Arab neighbor. Even
Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 was realized largely on the
basis of the United Nations' report on UN Security Council Resolution
425, which was also based on ""blue"" international borders.

Comparably, the 1993 Oslo agreements called for a staged Israeli
withdrawal from population centers in the lands occupied in 1967, which
are demarcated by a ""green line."" There is only one document in
international law that sets out ""blue lines"" for Jewish and Palestinian
states, and that is Resolution 181, which has been rendered useless by
the subsuming of those lines to the ""green lines"" of 1967. It is not
hard to understand that, having accepted a flexible ""green line,""
Palestinians are now expected to have no problem with further
modifications to the ""green line"" itself.

The official Palestinian position, as written by the Palestine
Liberation Organization, begins by accepting the ""historic compromise""
of a state on 22 percent of mandatory Palestine, i.e. the ""green line.""
This position is not supported by international law, the relevant UN
resolutions, or common sense. Further, making these kinds of compromises
before negotiations begin is not in the interest of any party bargaining
on behalf of its people.

Yes, negotiations have maintained the semblance of a relationship to
international law. The 1993 Declaration of Principles includes vague
references to UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, a fact used
to bolster the DOP's weak standing. Both of these resolutions, however,
state only that the acquisition of territory by force is unacceptable
and that states have the right to exist within secure and recognized
borders. Palestinians should never have accepted that this first
principle applies only to the borders of June 5, 1967. (Nor does the
second point help us, as Palestinians have never had a state of their
own.) The acquisition of land by force is unacceptable under the
principles of international law, whenever it occurs. Over the last few
years, we have been tasting the fruits of this poisonous tree deeply
rooted in the Oslo accords.

The consequences of these official Palestinian positions are manifest.
They include a complete refusal by Israel to accept the idea of June 5,
1967 borders (they are only ""green lines,"" after all). Israel also
refuses to acknowledge the principles of UN Resolution 194, which
establishes the right of return or compensation for Palestinian refugees
(and is notably one of the resolutions that Israel was required to
accept before joining the United Nations). Because its companion,
Resolution 181, has been vacated of all meaning, the truly vital issues
pertaining to the Palestinian cause have now been left to the principle
of de facto changes transformed into de jure legitimacies. One need only
examine the course of history over the last 50 years to see that this de
facto rule governs the Israeli understanding of refugees, settlements
and Palestinian statehood.

Outside the context of international law, negotiators have been left to
broker a deal based on force and belligerent activity. The ""green line""
is invisible, undocumented and completely unfounded in international
law. As such, using it as a reference point is in Israel's favor because
it sets a precedent of substituting principles of international law with
agreements signed under duress. Even worse, it leads to a situation
where one is torn between demanding full implementation of United
Nations resolutions to the letter or the total abandonment of these
resolutions. If these are our choices, they can only lead to hostilities
now and in the future.

Having arrived at this difficult point, it seems time to remember that
United Nations resolutions and principles of international law were
established to remedy issues of conflict. These principles continue to
hold remedies for resolving the wrong that has been done Palestinians
over the years, remedies that do not lead to disregarding the realities
of the current situation. Based on these principles, one can find
solutions for the agony and misery of Palestinian refugees, solve issues
related to Jerusalem and crack the problem of the settlements. The key
is to remedy wrongs done, not legitimize them.

If one looks at the experience of South Africa, problems of no less
scope had to be remedied after the dissolution of the apartheid system.
These remedies neither forced the original African landowners to accept
the hundreds of years of wrong done to them, nor led to the demolition
or displacement of the white colonial presence or economy. This embodies
the legal principle of ""restitution"", the idea that one can never turn
back the clock to undo a wrong, but one can claim responsibility for
that wrong and offer restitution to make it right.
"
"Isr","Neut","General Tommy Franks, the military commander of the coalition forces
waging war in Iraq, has declared that there is no doubt whatsoever
regarding the outcome of the war. The general was, of course, talking
about its military aspects. However, beyond the fighting, beyond even
the political arrangements in post-Saddam Iraq, loom giant question
marks. The Western Alliance, NATO, the European Union, and particularly
the United Nations will all have been derailed by the Iraqi imbroglio.
They will all emerge from it weakened, akin to damaged goods.

Their restructuring will engage the world in the months--and probably
the years--to come. Just how the pieces will be put together again will
determine what sort of world we will be living in. If all goes well, and
if the military campaign is short and successful, it could create a new,
and better, world order. But failure could also usher in a period of
international political instability, in which local tensions would win
out over global interests and in which particularistic issues would
defeat universalistic aims.

Such a danger would be particularly evident in the Middle East. How will
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict be affected by the fall-out from the
Iraqi war? Will Turkish-Kurdish tensions get out of hand? Will the
fragile stability of Jordan be unraveled? What problems will be created
for the regimes of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the Gulf countries by the
aftermath of the war? Will the moderates of Iran succeed in throwing off
the yoke of religious fanaticism?

A partial answer to many of these questions lies in the policy decisions
of the United States after the fighting draws to an end, and to the
extent that domestic issues, in particular the aim to be re-elected,
affect the president's foreign policy guidelines. President Bush had
been elected as a conservative leader on a strong domestic ticket and
with isolationist tendencies. His objective was a powerful, conservative
United States. Foreign policy hardly figured in his calculations.

All that changed after the terror attack of September 11, and especially
now that the United States has to face the consequences of the
tremendous setback it suffered in the international arena on the eve of
the Iraqi war. And yet the strong inclination of the president and his
leadership team will be to concentrate on those domestic issues that
will ensure the re-election of the president for a second term and not
on foreign policy issues. Patching up the differences with France,
Germany and Belgium will not gain votes; nor will any effort to
strengthen the United Nations, which has been the principal casualty in
the international arena.

A serious effort to implement the present roadmap
                                                 and to move forward in
promoting peace between Israelis and Palestinians will be considered as
estranging Jewish and fundamentalist Christian voters. So, equally, will
any movement towards lessening the hostility felt in the Muslim world as
a result of the war in Iraq.

These, then, are not popular roads for the United States to traverse as
the election campaign draws ever nearer. And yet, failure to do so could
have devastating consequences for the future world order, and in
particular for the countries of the Middle East.

An isolationist United States would leave a dangerous vacuum in the
international arena. The United Nations has been largely discredited and
can no longer act as the world policeman. The European Union is in
disarray. There is now more need that ever for an active American
foreign policy that could mend broken fences and restore a strong
American-European Alliance that would involve itself in defusing
potential threats, particularly in the Middle East. One such threat is
Iran, another could be Libya if it continues with its plan to obtain
weapons of mass destruction.

And without such involvement there is, sadly, little hope that Israelis
and Palestinians will be able to extract themselves from the present
morass. Continuing deterioration on that front can have dire
consequences for the stability of neighboring regimes, particularly that
of Jordan. For any progress on that front, the US will have to implement
the roadmap, and with it an international monitoring group to verify
implementation and report on infringements.

Will the American leaders be ready to face the new post-war challenges?
They will be sorely taxed by the need to establish a new, federal regime
in Iraq, based on human liberties. Their hands will be full in sorting
out their relations with Turks and Kurds, Sunnis and Shias. But over and
above all that, their minds will be focused on winning the next
elections. That will be their overriding goal. Let us hope that, at the
same time, they will be cognizant of their awesome responsibility to the
rest of the world, and will not falter in fulfilling a task that is not
less important than removing Saddam Hussein from power.
"
"Pal","Neut","The Anglo-American invasion of Iraq is eerily reminiscent of previous
Middle East conflicts.

Denounced by most of the world as a manifestly illegal imperial tantrum,
opposed by a clear majority of the United Nations Security Council, and
the subject of a major trans-Atlantic slugfest, it harks back to the
1956 Suez debacle.

Conceived on the basis of a thoroughly bizarre and equally fanciful
grand strategy, it reminds not a little of Ariel Sharon's adventurous
attempt to reconfigure the region in 1982.

And ceaselessly advocated by Israel's ruling circles as the bolt of
lightning that will resolve their combined military, political, and
economic predicaments, it has much in common with that other famous
""liberation"" of Arab territory in 1967.

The view that Israel will emerge as the main regional winner of this
war, and that its various adversaries will in the process be cut down to
size or eliminated, is shared throughout the Middle East. While Israel
certainly stands to gain in numerous ways--this is, after all, one of
the reasons this war is being fought--celebration seems somewhat
premature. Israel's military victories in 1956, 1967, and 1982, it bears
remembering, ultimately resolved nothing. And viewed in historical
perspective, they appear dubious indeed.

This is not to make light of the challenges that lie ahead. These will
be many, difficult, and violent--perhaps even existential. Using the
camouflage supplied by the roadmap
                                                , Israel will seek to
administer the coup de grace to the Palestinian Authority and
consolidate its hold on the occupied territories even further. To the
north, a decisive clash with Hizballah is just a matter of time. And as
the Sharonistas in Israel and Washington have long since made clear,
Syria and Iran are already firmly within their crosshairs.

Terrible as all of this undoubtedly is, it will have unforeseen
implications as well. In practical terms, it will amount to a reversion
of the Arab-Israeli conflict to that which existed prior to 1967--a
zero-sum game to eliminate either Zionism or Palestinian nationalism
from the region's political map as opposed to a struggle to achieve a
just and comprehensive peace on the basis of partition. As in the decade
that followed the 1948 War, it will be defined by popular and
clandestine struggles to undermine Arab governments that serve foreign
interests, and the emergence of new movements to organise and sustain
such struggles. Regime change, in other words, is not only what
Washington decides. It will also take curious twists and turns--a
process likely to intensify rather than mitigate conflict, whether with
Israel or the United States.

What has been striking so far is the number of fanciful assumptions
entertained about the current conflict by its advocates: that the UN and
international community will fall into line once Washington demonstrates
seriousness of purpose; that Turkish acquiescence is merely a matter of
money and time; that the Iraqi military won't fight, causing the Iraqi
regime to spontaneously combust the moment hostilities begin; that the
main military challenge confronting US forces is how to prevent the rice
and flowers offered by grateful Iraqis from clogging their tank engines.

Assumptions about The Day After, whether within Iraq or the region at
large, will prove similarly fantastic. But as the wars of 1956, 1967,
and 1982 demonstrate, it can take decades for the appropriate lessons to
be learned. The only prediction that can therefore be made with
certainty is that we're in for a very rough ride.
"
"Isr","Neut","The events of Rafah and the Gaza question must be viewed within the
broader context of changes in the mainstream Jewish public in Israel and
its attitude toward the Palestinians and the Arab world. The two
paradigms that mainstream Jews had believed in for decades recently
collapsed. One was based on the hope of establishing in the entirety of
the Greater Land of Israel a shared Jewish-Arab political entity; the
other, on the partition of the land between Jews and Arabs in an
historic compromise (""peace""). Both were based on the assessment that
they served the ""real interests"" of each side. The first lost the
adherence of mainstream Jews following the intifada in the late 1980s.
The second lost their trust when the structural failure of the Oslo
illusion became evident.

Every generation apparently needs to learn these lessons anew.
Paradoxically, in an earlier generation, the pessimistic Zionist
conclusion was articulated by a man who had placed peace with the Arab
residents of the country at the top of his order of priorities. It was
the founder of ""Brit Shalom"", Arthur Rupin, who formulated in his diary
in 1931 a sad conclusion that is today equally applicable to the state
of relations between Israel and the Palestinians: ""What we can get from
the Arabs we don't need, and what we need we cannot get [from them].""

The mainstream of the Jewish public today understands that Israel has to
disengage from the Palestinian population in order to maintain a nation
state that is both Jewish and democratic. Since there is no Palestinian
partner for an historic compromise that is prepared to abandon both
terrorism and the demand for ""return"", Israel must act unilaterally and
withdraw from the heavily populated heartland. Israel will withdraw to a
border it will determine unilaterally in accordance with the demographic
reality, incorporating the three settlement blocs where most of the
settlers dwell. Along this line a physical barrier is being erected,
designed to terminate the ""creeping return"" of hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians into Israel, to reduce Israel's vulnerability to
Palestinian terrorism, and to afford Israelis an acceptable quality of
life and standard of living. This barrier, the fence, enjoys public
support in Israel primarily as a defense against terrorism, but its
significance goes far deeper. In recent decades the entire way of life
of the Jewish population had been dictated by its intimate contact with
the Palestinians. The Jews have come to understand that the illegal
Palestinian migration, as well as the crime and the corruption from the
territories, are no less detrimental, in the long run, to their way of
life than the terrorism. In recent years Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,
one of the most prominent proponents of the Greater Israel paradigm, has
also reached similar conclusions. His acceptance of partition, acquiesce
in a Palestinian state and even willingness to dismantle settlements
does not derive from hope for peace, but rather from despair regarding
the chances of historic compromise as well as from recognition that the
status quo endangers the democratic nation state of the Jewish people.
His plan for unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip and northern
Samaria rests on the assumption that the Palestinians are not a
potential partner to a ""two states for two peoples"" compromise, and that
Israel cannot wait until (if ever) such a partner emerges.

Sharon's disengagement plan enjoys the massive support of the general
Israeli public, and of the Likud voters, but Likud members rejected it.
While some of the plan's opponents ideologically reject uprooting of
settlements, there are many, notably within the security community, who
are mainly concerned lest the image of Israel fleeing the territories
encourage more terrorism. Acutely aware that the image of Israel
""fleeing"" Lebanon due to Hizballah terrorism contributed to the war
initiated by the Palestinians in 2000, they fear that unilateral
departure from Gaza is liable to promote even worse acts of terrorism in
the West Bank (perhaps even among the Arab citizens of Israel).

The Rafah operation is intended not only to strike at terrorists, but
primarily to enhance Israel's capacity to deal with them following its
departure from the Gaza Strip. The key is the weapons supply conduit
along the Egyptian border. The main objective is to expand Israeli
control over the ridiculously narrow strip of land that separates Egypt
from Gaza, through which weapons are smuggled to the Palestinians. The
byproduct of a resolute operation in Gaza is a message to the
Palestinians that Israel is determined in its struggle against terrorism
and is creating the conditions that will enable it to meet this
challenge for as long as it takes.

The cost of such determined action is additional damage to Israel's
image. But this issue too must be seen within its wider context. The
media, European media in particular, present such a convoluted and
distorted image of Israel's struggle against Palestinian terrorism that
Israel no longer has anything to lose. If the fear of such damage to her
image deters Israel from taking needed action in time, terrorism will
only be stepped up to a point where more drastic counter measures are
called for. Those measures, in turn, will certainly cause even worse
damage to Israel's image.

Unilateral disengagement is inevitable because all other options are
unacceptable. The offensive against Palestinian terrorism will persist,
to demonstrate that terrorism has set Palestinian national objectives
back rather than allowing Palestinians to dictate Israeli policy. This
requires steadfastness and stamina. Israelis have demonstrated in the
last few years that they have more of those qualities then anyone
expected.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What do you think the incursions and demolitions in
Rafah have to do with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to
withdraw from Gaza, if anything?

A: I think that Sharon has distinguished himself in being
very, very brutal and inconsiderate of human rights principles. What is
happening in Rafah is only in line with his general performance.

Q: As a veteran advocate for the Palestinian cause, what
are your observations about what is happening in Rafah?

A: Our position is very clear. We have adopted a
conciliatory position by asking for a Palestinian state on one-fourth of
historic Palestine. Still, this is opposed and not respected by the
Israeli side. You can imagine how one might describe this Israeli position.

I know that Zionism claimed all of Palestine, but I think that it is
high time that Palestinian rights in Palestine are recognized. Our
conciliatory position is proof that we are sincere in [attempts] to
realize a needed peace between the two communities. This is being
neglected and Sharon is having his way in brutalizing the Palestinian
people in the hope that they will succumb and abandon their rights.

I know that our performance is not very organized. I know that we commit
mistakes. I don't agree with suicide actions on our part, but Israel is
doing something similar with its aerial bombardments. They target one
person, and then kill several people standing beside him. This is just
as bad as the suicide acts committed by the Islamists.

Israel's performance is far from showing commitment to peace principles,
to international principles, and it is high time that the objective of
peace is given more consideration and more sincerity.

Q: Have you given up hope on the intervention of the
international community?

A: No. I am sorry that the international community is
adopting a very passive ineffectual position, but still I hope that it
will wake up to its responsibilities and not just stand by and watch.

Q: What can you say about the relationship between United
States President George W. Bush and Sharon and its impact on the conflict?

A: I am very unhappy with the Bush performance. I don't know
how informed he is about the [Palestinian] problem and its historic
background. It seems to me that Bush's actions do not indicate that he
is very well informed about the realities of the problem. He is very
involved in his career and his future. Certainly, this has terrible
repercussions.

Q: Do you see a way in which Palestinians can make the best
of this situation?

A: I think there is much that can be done. The Palestinians
have been acting without even the slightest organization. One of the
weaknesses of Palestinians is that they are very emotional, and this at
times works against their interests. We have to be more organized, less
emotional and really see things objectively--and act objectively. Much
of what we do deprives us of the support of the international community.
We have been suffering such terrible injustice, and our performance
deprives us of the needed sympathy.

Q: Did anything surprise you about what happened in Rafah?

A: I would be the first to admit that we often do things
that we should not do. We commit mistakes. But exploiting that, as
Sharon is doing, is brutal.
"
"Isr","Neut","In most cases, wars and violent conflicts result in a political
settlement. But it is not at all certain that after more than 50 years
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is approaching this stage. Many in the
West and in Israel are accustomed to thinking in ""can do"" terms of
finding solutions to problems. Liberals in particular argue that with
good will and intense intellectual effort, it is possible to find the
magic formula that will satisfy the conflicted parties and lead to
peaceful coexistence. Yet reality sometimes places us in situations for
which there is no satisfactory solution, either in the short or the long
term. In these instances the parties involved continue to struggle until
one of them is defeated, or fatigue leads to temporary quiet or even
produces an end of conflict.

Yet even if Israelis and Palestinians have indeed reached a stage of
societal fatigue that generates the kind of reformulation of national
goals that might enable a compromise, the violent struggle and its
consequences will certainly exercise decisive influence over the outline
of a future settlement and the agenda leading up to it.

The bitter truth is that the use of force has an educational dimension,
insofar as it can cause suffering. There are societies whose learning
process requires the use of force. The author of Proverbs wrote 3,000
years ago ""spare the rod and spoil the child.""

Moreover, the Middle East is a part of the world where all actors employ
various degrees of military force to attain their political objectives.
The use of force is part and parcel of the international rules of the
game. Indeed, ours is one of the most heavily armed regions in the
world, where no state, and certainly not Yasir Arafat, is prepared to
concede the need to establish and maintain an army. Notably, all the
regional elites gauge the military might of their neighbors in analyzing
their international relations, except a few naive individuals on the
Israeli left. Ehud Barak was right when he remarked that in the Middle
East the weak do not get a second chance. Lebanon was conquered by force
by the Syrians, South Yemen was ""united"" by force with its sister in the
north, and only American military intervention saved Kuwait from a
similar fate. Any attempt to argue that military force does not play an
important role in the Middle East ignores both international reality and
practice.

This is certainly true of the Israel-Arab case, where the two sides are
waging an extended violent struggle over the same parcel of land. True,
the Zionist movement has demonstrated a realistic political approach,
and throughout most of its history displayed a far-reaching readiness to
compromise and accept the principle of partitioning the Land of Israel.
Yet most Jews finally abandoned the concept of the Greater Land of
Israel only after the first Intifada broke out in 1987. It was only
following a violent struggle with the Palestinians that Israeli society
concluded that the cost of maintaining an Israeli presence throughout
the entire homeland was too great. The result was a more active search
than in previous years for a possible Palestinian partner.

The evolution of the Palestinian movement from the call to destroy
Israel to the advocacy in 1988 of a solution based on two states for two
peoples, is the result of its realistic recognition that Israel is too
strong, and that any attempt to uproot it in the near future will not
succeed. The failure of the first Intifada (1987-1990) to push Israel
out of Judea, Samaria and Gaza was undoubtedly one of the root causes of
the Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO's) resort to a political
track. Further, the expansion of Jewish settlement throughout the Land
of Israel created new faits accomplis under Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
auspices that were decidedly inconvenient for Palestinians and
constituted a significant catalyst toward their agreement to negotiate.
The PLO came to the negotiating table at Oslo due to its weakness, not
because of a genuine longing for peace.

Israel of course recognizes that there are political and moral
constraints upon the use of force. This is why it is difficult for
Israel to translate its technological, economic and military advantage
into an immediate decisive military victory. But Israel enjoys
sufficient strength to prevent Palestinian military achievements. Since
September 2000 it has done so with the broad backing of the Jewish
public in Israel. Moreover, Israel's military capacity to cause the
Palestinians pain and suffering in a selective way remains an important
factor in moderating their demands.

Operation Defensive Shield demonstrated a sample of the destructive
consequences of ongoing Palestinian terrorism and provocations directed
at the IDF. The continued terrorism carried out by the extreme members
of Palestinian society hinders the attempt by a variety of observers to
assess the tremendous impact that Israeli forces left in Palestinian
cities. Thus Israeli strength is a vital condition for altering
Palestinian consciousness as to what is possible in terms of a
settlement with the Jewish state, and for directing Palestinian energies
back to the negotiating table on conditions congenial to Israel.

Still, only an educational process lasting several generations will
soften Palestinians' hatred for Jews and render their leaders more
realistic. There is no chance that such a process will be fulfilled
without significant Israeli military power.
"
"Pal","Neut","For the last fifty years of this century-old struggle, Palestinians have
watched Israel's military advantage improve dramatically. The internal
cohesion of the Jewish state, buttressed by the experience of Jews in
fascist Europe during World War II, and the heavy arming of Israel in
crucial periods by Britain, France and the United States, all were
reasons for the growing military imbalance.

But even though Israel has come out on top in every war with the Arab
states except the October War and the military incursion into Lebanon,
Israel has yet to solve the Palestinian problem. When interest in a
territorial compromise peaked on the Israeli side, it did not find a
corresponding partner among the Arab states, primarily because Israel
failed to seek a deal with Palestinians. When Palestinians became
interested in the late seventies, the Israeli right wingers Menachem
Begin and Yitzhak Shamir had stolen the day.

Only in the last ten years, after the November 1988 meeting of the
Palestine National Council in Algiers and the defeat of Israel's Likud
after the Madrid conference, have there been decisive elements on both
sides simultaneously seeking a territorial solution. Still, the search
for a non-military solution has failed. The Oslo agreement did not
address crucial final status issues, transitional mechanisms for
resolving conflict and--most importantly--the main obstacle to the
territorial solution, i.e., Jewish settlements and the confiscation of
land to establish those settlements. The result has been the return by
the Sharon government to a military solution, with devastating results
on the Palestinian infrastructure and economy.

Like most Palestinians, I see Israeli military rule as a colonial rule.
As in the experience of most liberation movements, Palestinians have the
right to resist this military rule by all means. The question is, how
does one use that option? Does one continue to use it when the
overwhelming odds are in favor of our protagonist and when there is
total Arab acquiescence, defacto if not political, to Israeli hegemony?

The use of violence against Israeli civilians in the form of suicide
bombings or other attacks is counterproductive. People who legitimize it
see it as a way to get revenge and debilitate the Israelis. But if one
wants to address the issue politically, then obviously the liabilities
of this tactic far outnumber the assets.

In addition to the moral objections to the repugnant and unacceptable
attacks on Israeli civilians, these acts tend to mobilize the Israeli
population against any territorial peace initiative, as well as
legitimize--in the eyes of the international public--acts of state
terror against Palestinian civilians and combatants alike. Second, they
reinforce the hegemony of the extreme Israel right; and finally, they
appear to alter the political objective of Palestinians from one seeking
a two state solution within internationally-recognized boundaries to one
in which there is no distinction made between the territories occupied
by Israel in 1967 and the rest of the state of Israel. When that
happens, it becomes impossible for any Israeli to come to terms with an
historic resolution of the conflict. If the settlement of Ofra and Tel
Aviv are considered equal combat areas, then we Palestinians must either
have the ability to fight this all-conclusive battle--or rethink our
strategy.

Here one recalls the efficacy and moral superiority of the means of
struggle used by Palestinians in the first uprising. Street
demonstrations and confrontations with the army, commodity boycotts and
boycott of the civil administration, as well as more lethal clashes with
the army all achieved tremendous support for Palestinians throughout the
world and within Israel and even succeeded in mobilizing a large segment
of the Israeli army itself. People realized that Israel could no longer
govern this country. I think that if this intifada had continued with
attacks inside the occupied territories then Palestinians would have
enjoyed overwhelming support. As it stands now, return to this strategy,
while essential, will be much more difficult.

The reason that this approach was abandoned in this intifada was in part
due to the national movement Fateh and the Palestinian Authority's
succumbing to the desperate and despairing messianic approach adopted by
Hamas and Islamic Jihad. This approach sees salvation for Palestinians
either in the afterlife, or after a prolonged bloody conflict that would
last for generations--with the encounter between the Crusades and us as
its historical antecedent. Its results will not be seen in our lifetime.
It might well end in the total defeat of Israelis, but it could just as
easily end up in the dispersal and second catastrophe of the Palestinian
people.

This is the reason for our collective appeal published this week in Al
Quds newspaper: to open up a public debate over the politics, morality
and expediency of attacking civilians as an interment of warfare.

As public intellectuals or political activists, we will not be able to
convince our adversaries within the Palestinian national movement
through the means of this statement alone. Any rethinking of the
Palestinian strategy must be based on offering the Palestinian people
hope that there is a political solution. That can only come through
external intervention that emphasizes the importance of two states, a
timetable to bring that about and mechanisms of implementation. This
should be jointly proposed by the US and the European Union, and
underwritten by the United Nations.

What Palestinians can do themselves is to reach out to Israelis who are
willing to energize and relaunch a peace movement based on Israeli
withdrawal and the dismantling of settlements. But again, these two
processes have to move in tandem in order to be successful--a political
movement from outside with mechanisms for implementation and a movement
among Palestinians to reach out to the Israeli public and create an
alternative to this right-wing Israeli government.
"
"Isr","Neut","During the first half of the 20th century, the nations of Europe fought
amongst themselves two all-out wars, in which they killed more than 40
million people. During the second half of that century these nations
together established the European Union, with a shared citizenship and
open borders among the member states.

The choice which Israelis and Palestinians now face is: Do we wish to
follow the European example during the coming decades, and first kill
each other indiscriminately and in growing numbers? Or can we bypass the
initial European experience, put an immediate end to mutual violence,
and replace it with evolving mutual relations between the states of
Palestine and Israel?

Martin Luther King summed up this human dilemma 40 years ago, in the
following words: ""Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence,
and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of
destruction.... The chain reaction of evil--hate begetting hate, wars
producing more wars--must be broken, or we shall be plunged into the
dark abyss of annihilation.... Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only
light can do that.""

We must evolve together a shared vision of light, for the simple reason
that this is what the great majority of Israelis and Palestinians deeply
seek. Despite the mutual violence; despite the escalating mutual
de-humanization of the other; despite these agonies--what most Israelis
and Palestinians seek is to live in peace, in a life of independence and
dignity, within their own sovereign states.

Can such a vision become real by the year 2025? Obviously, several major
developments are necessary.

First and foremost both people must recognize the humanity of the other.
First and foremost we are all human beings, we all have fathers and
mothers, brothers and sisters, children and grandchildren; we all seek
to fulfill our humanity as best we can, for ourselves as independent
persons, for our families and for our communities. Recognizing the
humanity of the other is also acknowledging their history, their faith
and their suffering. Recognizing the humanity of the other means that
leaders on both sides must regularly address their neighboring people:
No more violence between us, and let us henceforth mutually discover
each other's humanity, for God created us all in his image--both
Palestinians and Israelis.

Secondly, peacemaking must be generous on both sides. On the Israeli
side it must be generous in giving up territories occupied in 1967 and
settlements, and in facilitating a generous solution to the refugee
problem--a solution which however will not undermine Israel as a state
of the Jewish people. Palestinians, on their side, must also be generous
in acknowledging Israelis' deep need for security. Therefore they should
commit themselves actively to putting an end to all terrorist
initiatives and all kinds of violence.

Third, peacemaking should be facilitated by help from abroad. On one
level foreign help is necessary to ensure peacekeeping on both sides and
to prevent acts of violence. On another, the Palestinian state acutely
needs aid to construct a modern economy. What the Marshall Plan did for
Europe after 1945, a similar program could do for the new Palestinian
state. The European Union with an annual GNP of more than 8000 billion
dollars should for several years devote an annual 0.1% of its GNP to
closing the economic gap between the Palestinian state and Israel. Why
should it do so? Because the alternative is the danger that
Israeli-Palestinian relations may escalate into a regional explosion.

Fourth, by the year 2025 peace between Palestinians and Israelis should
facilitate the fulfillment of the regional vision of peace offered by
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia: a comprehensive peace between Israel
and all her Arab neighbors; peace not only as the end of wars, but also
as the development of human relations between Arabs and Israelis in
fields of shared interest, on an equal basis.

Lastly, as the world evolves into expanding networks of nations,
Palestine and Israel will also become partners in such organizations.
One possibility is an association with the European Union. Another is
the emergence of a regional association linking, for example, Jordan,
Palestine and Israel. Thus, by the year 2025, Israelis and Palestinians
will evolve multiple identities: as human beings, as nationals, as
citizens of their countries, as believers in a monotheistic faith, as
professionals linked to members of their profession in the world, and as
citizens of a world whose different parts are linked together.

Can such a vision be fulfilled? If we have leaders locked in their
experience of the previous century, then we are doomed to replicate what
European nations did to each other in the first half of that century.
But if we have leaders with a genuine human vision--both for their own
people and for their neighbors--then by the year 2025 we shall already
be living in a new human reality.

The Book of Proverbs in the Bible says (29, 18): ""Where there is no
vision, the people will go wild."" In other words: if our leaders do not
lead us to fulfill an effective human vision, the consequence will be
chaos for both our societies.

It is up to us to choose: do we wish our leaders to develop a shared
human vision for a shared human future, or do we blindly follow leaders
who will lead our nations into chaos.

The choice remains open.
"
"Pal","Neut","Predicting the distant future of the region is an intellectual and
theoretical challenge. This area is full of surprises and still
decidedly affected by the one-man Arab rule. Indeed, asking the question
of what this region will look like in 2025 is a bit of hurtful joke, in
that Palestinians and Israelis continue to bury their loved ones daily
in this enduring and bloody conflict.

Still, the question proves useful, not only for strategic planning, but
also in dealing with the pain of both Palestinians and Israelis. To
predict our future, one must free oneself from the pressures of the
present and positions of the past, examining things objectively and
without selfishness. Most importantly, one should consider that the long
and bitter Arab-Israeli conflict has proven to both sides that neither
one can deny or erase the existence of the other.

There is now a regional consensus that the dawn of this decade commenced
a new phase, one different from any period since the Palestinian Nakba
or ""Catastrophe"" and Israel's establishment in 1948. That is why both
Israelis and Palestinians answered the call of former United States
President George Bush, Sr., laying down their arms and entering into
direct negotiations.

In spite of all Arab and Israeli optimistic, pessimistic or (in the
words of Emile Habibi) pessoptimistic perspectives on the peace process,
no one believes that the region might return to its state prior to the
end of the Cold War and before the Palestine Liberation Organization,
Jordan and Egypt reached bilateral agreements with Israel. Even if
Israeli-Arab negotiations are not currently on track, certainly there is
no longer the chance of total war in the Middle East.

Too, the state of non-war and non-peace will not persist because the
parties in this struggle will eventually be required to produce radical
changes in their security, military, political and economic strategies
and begin a new approach in their relations. The events of September 11
and subsequent statements by the United States administration have
proven that powerful strategic interests will no longer allow regional
foment. As such, it would be wise for Palestinians, Arabs and Israelis
to come to consensus before an agreement is forced on them.

In 1967, Israel occupied the lands of its Palestinian, Egyptian, Syrian,
Lebanese and Jordanian neighbors. The region subsequently paid a high
price in development and advancement. No objective researcher can ignore
that the prolonged state of war and non-peace between the Arabs and
Israel has worked to militarize Israeli society and suppress democracy,
civil rights and advancement in Arab societies.

Therefore, despite Israeli viewpoints to the contrary, in the year 2025
Mandate Palestine will hold two independent and sovereign states with
clear international borders based on United Nations Security Council
242. The Palestinian population will have grown to nine million through
new births and the return of a large number of refugees forced by Israel
in 1947 and 1948 to leave their homes. Alongside Palestine will be
Israel, whose population will rival its neighbor (I doubt that Israel
will be able to maintain its character as a purely Jewish state, since
the Arab minority is expected to grow to over 3 million by 2025--without
the return of one refugee).

In the inevitable era of complete peace, the security of Israel and the
Israelis will not be an issue, nor will the rights of Arabs in Israel.
This minority will obtain all its rights through democratic means, and
may even be under self-rule. I expect that the Arabs in Israel and
Eastern Jews coming from Morocco, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon will
play an important role in advancing the relationship between Israel and
the Arab countries.

The end of regional ""non-peace"" will immediately lead to a decline in
national concern for the external enemy that Israel has represented in
Arab thought and visa versa. The result will be heightened social and
class struggle within Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.

Since 1991, I have believed that the Madrid Peace Conference and
subsequent peace agreements were a separating line between the old era
and a new one still in formation. History shows that transformation from
one historical epoch to another necessitates the passing of transitional
stages characterized by conflict, either lengthy or short, between the
past and its understandings and the future, which arrives with its own
understandings and an urgency to impose itself. The future will force
all in the region to quickly turn regional peace into a permanent
strategy, with as little human and economic loss as possible.

I think it is Israel's right to demand Palestinian and Arab recognition
and normal relations, in order to have security and control over its
destiny. However, it is impossible to meet this demand as long as the
Israeli leadership refuses to recognize the Palestinian people's right
to self-determination and refuses to determine its borders with its
neighbors.

There must be a settling of the past and its tragedies. This requires a
historic reconciliation between the two peoples, starting with
recognition by the Israeli leadership of its responsibility for the
injustices and terrible crimes committed against the Palestinian people
and other Arab peoples from 1948 until today. It also means a just
solution to the Palestinian refugee problem. This recognition is a
legitimate right and psychological need of the Palestinian people.

Did not the Israeli and Jewish leaderships demand that Germany recognize
the crimes committed by the Nazis in the 40s? The Palestinian people
affirm that this Israeli and Jewish demand was just. By the same token,
the Palestinians have the right to demand of Israel and world Zionism
that they recognize the historic injustice they, too, have
caused.

"Isr","Neut","Q: Was the collapse of the roadmap
                                                 predestined, or avoidable?

A: The roadmap was the only option to get us out of the mess we
were in with the Palestinians. It was not implemented the way it should
have been. The Palestinians didn't do enough to deal with the
infrastructure of terrorism, and allowed Hamas and Islamic Jihad to
prepare for another round. [In this sense] the most important thing
missing in the Palestinian Authority is central command, a single
leadership that takes responsibility and earns the respect of its own
people.

Q: And on the Israeli side?

On the Israeli side there may be a problem with the [policy] position
but not with the leadership, in the sense that decisions are respected
and the government is in control. As for the position, Israel should
have decided that either we do this on our own or we get the
Palestinians to do it, knowing that they won't be immediately
successful. If you want them to do the job, then organize international
pressure on them. But once we do the job, it gives an excuse for the
extremists to carry out their attacks. [In this regard] Israeli attacks,
for example in Hebron and Nablus, were justified only if they really
prevented an immediate attack, a ticking bomb. If this was not the case
then the attacks were not justified.

Q: How would you change the Israeli approach?

A: We need to set a target of a border for Israel. If the
roadmap can do this, then Israel should stick with it, even if there are
violations here and there and we need to defend ourselves. We should
give the Palestinians the option to do the [security] job and [we
should] build the fence more quickly. If I were doing it two years ago,
the fence would be built now, and would include the main settlement
blocs near the green line that we planned to include inside Israel in
the future. This would leave room for negotiations when they come, and
provide an incentive for the Palestinians to negotiate.

Q: But the fence got in the way of the roadmap, and became
a controversial issue in and of itself.

A: It was a mistake not to do the fence earlier, but even this
difficulty could be mended in a way. It requires leadership on our part:
not to make the lives of Palestinians difficult, but to include the
settlement blocs. We should tell the United States, the European Union
and the world that this is for security, and that we are ready also to
remove the remote settlements beyond the fence. This would give us the
political room to build up a coalition of agreement.

Q: At this point in time, can the roadmap/ceasefire process
be revived?

A: There are only two options. One is to revive the roadmap and
withdraw and give the Palestinians security and political sovereignty
over large parts of the West Bank and Gaza. We don't do everything at
once, but we create a border, on the other side of which there is a
Palestinian state. This is an imperfect solution, but it relieves us of
a demographic ticking bomb.

The other option is that we do the job, defending ourselves everywhere,
including in the streets of Gaza and Nablus. This is much more dangerous
security-wise and politically. So either we do the job everywhere or
they do it in lands we withdraw from. As long as the roadmap is not
officially dead we should not bury it.

Q: Can we depend on the United States to shepherd this
process skillfully?

A: The US has its own problems now in Iraq. There has been no
problem with the US attitude here. But it depends whether the US is
ready to invest the leadership to revive the roadmap.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: Recently, it has been said that the ceasefire cannot be
over, that Palestinians have no other choice right now, and that even
Hamas doesn't really have a choice.

A: I think that there is a chance that a ceasefire could be
agreed upon once again, but this is not the only possibility. A new
ceasefire will have to have better guarantees in order to be respected
by both sides--especially by the Israelis--and in order to be convincing
for the Palestinian movement and the Palestinian people. Otherwise, I
think that the present cycle of violence will continue and perhaps
become more violent than what we have seen over the last three years of
the intifada.

In spite of that, I believe that the option of a negotiated settlement
is, in the final analysis, the only option that could end this struggle.
For the time being, I think that the conditions for this option have not
yet matured, mainly because Israelis have not come to the conclusion
that they have to address the main needs and rights of the Palestinian
people, even within the framework of the roadmap
                                                .

Q: Do you support the roadmap?

A: I have a lot of criticisms of many of the provisions of the
roadmap. From the beginning, I thought that the unconditional acceptance
of the roadmap by the Palestinian leadership, even before it [the
roadmap] was formally presented to both sides was an error--not because
the roadmap should have been rejected, but because this opened the way
for the Israeli rejection of the roadmap through its ""comments""
                                                       on the text.

Now the roadmap has become a general framework for strenuous
negotiations between the two parties, and without the international
supervision that was promised in the text itself. The whole time
framework that was included in the text has exploded, leaving the
Israelis in complete control of the development of the process and
therefore capable of dictating the terms. This makes the roadmap an
Israeli solution, rather than an international compromise between the
two parties.

I think that there are positive aspects within the roadmap that could be
a basis for the future of a negotiated settlement, especially the call
for an independent sovereign Palestinian state and the call for an end
to the occupation of 1967.

Q: What is your impression of the government of Prime
Minister Mahmoud Abbas?

A: The attitude taken by the present government towards the
negotiations on the roadmap is basically incorrect. I think that they
have drifted along with Israeli and American attempts to undermine all
of the positive aspects of the roadmap and to turn the present process
into a series of security dictates. This has weakened the popular base
of the present government and may gradually lead to its collapse.

Q: You were one of those who called for Palestinian
national dialogue with Hamas. Do you think that there have been positive
results of this dialogue, and how can this dialogue continue?

A: There was a positive result of this dialogue in that, for
the first time in the history of the Palestinian movement, there was
unanimous agreement on a ceasefire with Israel. This did not occur even
in 1980 or in 1981 in Lebanon. All the ceasefires that were declared by
the Palestinian leadership had people that opposed them and sabotaged them.

Now, for the first time, we have a general consensus on this ceasefire
on the bases that were developed by the different factions, which are
actually the same terms included in the roadmap itself. Even those
factions that are against the roadmap have actually adopted the same
terms for the ceasefire that were included in the roadmap.

This was a step forward and I think that this could have been a sound
basis for continuing dialogue in order to arrive at a common platform
for a unified national command to include all of the Palestinian
factions, and also the Palestinian Authority and Palestine Liberation
Organization.

Q: You are a political leader. You said that it is possible
that the violence could get much worse. Personally, how do you feel
about that? Is the prospect of a very violent turn of events worth it?

A: Personally, I feel very much distressed, of course. I think
that what we are actually asking for and what we are fighting for is a
peaceful settlement that is based on recognition of the right of the
Palestinian people to an independent and sovereign state within the
borders of 1967. If the Israelis agree to that, and if the Americans
actually press the Israelis to meet this Palestinian demand, I think
that we could have a very simple and very short way out of this
continued violence.

I do not feel comfortable with the continuation of violence and war, but
this is an option that has been forced upon the Palestinian people. They
have to fight to the end. If they have to do it through military means,
then they will--despite the hardships.

But they will do it not because they want to fight, but because fighting
is necessary to reach their goal of a peace that meets their national
aspirations, and the aspiration of independence.
"
"Isr","Neut","The comparison between what is happening today in the lands of historic
Eretz Yisrael where Jews and Arabs live together, albeit in armed
conflict, and what took place between whites and blacks in South Africa,
is infuriating. This applies to both the practical as well as the
principled side of the issue.

The whites conquered territories in Africa, installed colonialist rule,
and a negligible minority ruled over an absolute majority. The lands
where the colonialist forces settled, including in South Africa, were
taken from their former inhabitants.

In contrast, the Jews returned to their historic homeland, from which
they had been exiled for nearly 2,000 years. All the territories that
were settled since the commencement of the orderly, slow and
non-threatening return of the Jewish people to its land in the last
quarter of the 19th c. were, without exception, purchased at full price.
Moreover, when the Jews began to return to their land its foreign
rulers, the Ottoman Empire, ruled over Arabs and Jews alike. This points
to an additional indisputable historic fact: after the Jews went into
exile the land was ruled only by foreign conquerors; no other nation
established its sovereignty there.

The Jewish people's war of independence in 1948-9 was in fact initiated
by the Arabs. On May 15, 1948 five Arab standing armies--of Egypt,
Syria, Transjordan, Iraq and Lebanon--invaded the country that had that
day declared its independence. After nearly two years of a tough and
painful defensive war in which the Jewish people, scarcely three years
after the Holocaust, lost one percent of its sons and daughters,
including Holocaust survivors, the invaders were expelled. Under United
Nations auspices armistice agreements were signed with the invading states.

The 1949 armistice lines could have been converted into borders
sanctioned by peace agreements had the Arabs so desired. Instead, they
geared up for a second round. After 19 years, 10 of them accompanied by
constant hostile but not decisive aggression, Egypt closed the Tiran
Straits in May 1967, expelled the UN from Sinai and thereby in effect
declared war on Israel. Syria joined her, as did, in the course of the
war itself, Jordan.

It was in this war that the Jewish people returned to the very heart of
its land, the land of the Bible: to Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip,
and to the Old City of Jerusalem, the Temple Mount and the Western Wall.

After several years hesitation there began a movement of settlement in
these liberated territories. True, to put it mildly, the settlers were
not welcomed by the Arabs. But that does and cannot make this a ""South
African situation"". The Arabs were offered--in complete contrast to
their situation under Jordanian rule--political solutions which, had
they embraced them, would long ago have given them sovereignty, had that
indeed been their true objective.

The Oslo accords, which I opposed because I knew their outcome would be
catastrophic, created an ""irreversible"" reality leading to the creation
of such a sovereign state. Some 42 percent of Judea and Samaria were
delivered over to the Palestinian Authority. This is, in practice,
sovereignty. And in these effectively sovereign territories dwell 96
percent of the Palestinians. Prior to the terror war they launched in
October 2000 they were, unlike the blacks under apartheid, free of any
Israeli rule, enjoying all the symbols of sovereignty: a flag,
presidential and parliamentary elections, media free of any Israeli
control (but not of control by Yasser Arafat), and foreign relations
with many countries, including representation in the UN. Israel withdrew
from these territories and, had they not been used for the launching of
Qasam rockets or suicide bombers, would never have returned, certainly
not to rule. Even we, the settlers, acquiesced de facto in this withdrawal.

But the Palestinians did not suffice with a state alongside Israel. They
wanted, and still want, a state instead of Israel. This is the central
reason for the current terror war in which Palestinians too have
suffered greatly-and not Israel's rule which, in the eyes of those who
are ignorant of history and harbor a pathological hatred for Israel,
somehow seems to resemble apartheid.
"
"Pal","Neut","Palestinians and their supporters often cite South African apartheid
when trying to illustrate the conditions the Palestinian people are
living under. The wall that is being built up and down occupied
Palestinian territory is thus known as the apartheid wall, and, just
recently, President Yasser Arafat invoked South Africa when, in an
interview with the London-based al Sharq al Awsat newspaper, he said he
would be happy to do as Nelson Mandela did and step aside for a new
generation of leaders, but only, as in the case of South Africa, when
nationhood is achieved.

Indeed, the South African apartheid system does exhibit a number of
similarities to the system installed by the Israeli government to rule
Palestinians under occupation. To give but one, perhaps the most obvious
example, Palestinians in the occupied territories live under one law,
military law, while Israeli settlers in the same occupied territories
live under another, civil Israeli law.

Since 1948, Israel has been using what are known as emergency
regulations that were originally devised by the British Mandate
authorities, ironically, at times to be used by the British against the
Jews. These emergency laws were used for years against the Palestinian
population inside the green line and, since the occupation of the Gaza
Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, are still applied in occupied
Palestinian territory.

The rules give all legal power to the Israeli military governor
vis-a-vis the occupied Palestinian population under his rule, unlike the
settlers in occupied territory who are subject to Israeli civilian
police. Thus a Palestinian will be put before a military court (if he
goes to court and is not simply placed in administrative detention),
while an Israeli settler will retain his full civil and political rights
before a civil court.

In general, while Israel likes to portray itself as a country ruled by
law, the fact remains that for Palestinians, the Israeli courts are the
chief instruments through which torture and discrimination against them
are institutionalized. And in this vein there are many other instances
of obvious discrimination that are remarkably similar to the apartheid
era (compare settler-only roads to white-only restaurants, or the ""right
of return"" of Jews who have never been to the country while Palestinian
refugees indigenous to the country linger in exile, etc.).

But there are also important differences. The black South African
struggle was one for equal rights in one country. While some
Palestinians would advocate a similar struggle here, the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict has become primarily one over the creation
of two separate states, or rather a Palestinian state alongside Israel.

And while the struggle against apartheid was a struggle for equal social
and political rights, the Palestinian struggle, in addition to that, is
also an existential struggle. The current Israeli prime minister is the
first ever to publicly state that he would accept a Palestinian state,
but on the ground he is doing his best to ensure that such a thing
cannot become a reality by isolating Palestinians into cantons and
imposing his own vision of what land such a state can be built on.

Finally, the apartheid regime existed while there was still a global
balance of power. Today's unipolar world is held entirely in the sway of
the world's single hegemon, the United States. And the US is Israel's
staunchest supporter. While black South Africans received crucial
solidarity from sectors of American society for whom the civil rights
movement was a defining and greatly empowering phenomenon, no equivalent
exists for the Palestinians.

Herein lies a major problem for Palestinians. While a number of
pressures led to the end of the apartheid regime, a crucial one was the
international isolation and economic sanctions that were eventually
imposed on that country. Palestinians have tried, and continue to try to
convince the international community that a similar course of action
with regards to Israel would be an effective way of finally solving this
conflict. But as long as the US continues successfully to block such
efforts, via its veto power in the United Nations Security Council or
direct pressure on a number of countries--and as the only global power
the US can dictate and determine how political processes unfold--it is
an avenue of pressure that will be closed off to Palestinians.

In short, while both apartheid South Africa and the Israeli occupation
are similar in the desire shown by one people to control the indigenous
other of a given country and the lengths to which they would go to crush
the will of their targeted populations, the Palestinians must also
understand the differences in the two cases to better achieve their
national rights. Thus, while apartheid South Africa might provide a
fairly accurate comparison to illustrate the plight of the Palestinian
people, it does not necessarily provide the model upon which action
should be emulated. Palestinians need to be creative to fight for their
rights in the context of the particularities of their situation, which
in certain crucial aspects are different from apartheid.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: ""Arab diplomacy"" in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict--a new phenomenon?

A: The phenomenon begins as early as 1937, when a conference of
Arab heads of state adopted the Palestinian cause. This represented the
bankruptcy of the Palestinian movement, its strategic failure to
successfully rationalize its relations with the Zionist movement. The
Arab League, from its original seven members to the present 22,
developed a system of consensus according to the most extreme position,
always negative. This was the case in '47 and again in '67, at the
Khartoum summit. Until the Saudi initiative the League always rejected
the UN partition resolution of 1947 and played a negative role.

Alongside the Palestinian issue, other matters never occupied the League
in an orderly way, but only symbolically and superficially. We are
dealing with a culture that emphasizes words rather than content. The
low point was the League's endorsement in '76 of the Syrian takeover of
Lebanon. Nor did the war in Yemen during the '60s shatter this phony
leniency.

Q: The Saudi initiative, approved by the Arab League in March
2002, is really such an exceptional event?

A: At the tactical level the Saudis were buying American goods with
Israeli currency. But this is an irreversible act, a diplomatic
milestone and, in some ways, penance for past sins. This is the basis
for continued dialogue.

Q: What brought about the change in the League's behavior?

A: The turning point was the 1991 Gulf War. A rift formed in the
Arab front, along with a readiness to link up with the US, and the
shattering of a bogus tradition. The big change was the collapse of the
USSR; the game of playing off the two blocs was over. The Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait was a brutal conquest of territory that was seen as a
dangerous precedent. Since it did not involve Israel, there was less
need for a consensus.

Q: In parallel with the Saudi initiative, Egypt, Jordan and
Saudi Arabia are functioning as a kind of ""club"" that exercises
restraint and avoids harsh retribution toward Israel despite the
Intifada, and that cooperates with the Quartet, and particularly the US,
in the search for a solution. How do you explain both these countries'
reserve and their activism?

A: Each member of this triangle delivers different goods. Each has
its specific attitude toward Israel and the US. Egypt is the central
country with whom peace has stood the test, despite the isolation that
the Arab states initially imposed. The physical barrier--the Sinai
Peninsula buffer--that separates Egypt and Israel, American financial
support, and Egypt's traditional leadership role, all enable Egypt to
avoid cutting ties, even if it has never activated most of its
agreements with us. Saudi Arabia is sitting on oil reserves and its
interest in protecting the regime is shared by the US. As for Jordan,
severing relations with Israel due to the Palestinian issue would open
the way for the complete Palestinization of the country, and would
constitute an admission that its overriding interest is Palestine, when
in fact Jordan shares broad strategic interests with Israel. But if this
triangle doesn't have an external ""glue""--America--it cannot be expected
to register significant achievements.

Q: There is an inclination among certain circles in Israel
and the US, and even here and there in the Arab world, to treat the
Arabs as if they are paper tigers--for example, in the Iraqi context.

A: I don't agree with this concept. Within a Muslim world of 1.2
billion, the Arab world at its center enjoys broad cultural influence.
This is a world that places importance on ideals of honor; hence
language is important. If you insult it, you achieve nothing. An
arrogant American approach is liable to generate a transformation from
collective affront to personal humiliation, meaning more terrorism.

On the other hand, the search for an external savior by certain Arab
circles reflects disdain for their own society and an inclination always
to blame someone else for their troubles. If someone else is to blame,
then someone else has to fix things for them.

Q: One of the American demands of the Arabs is to replace
Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat. This would require a radical change in
approach to the Palestinian issue. Could this happen?

A: It's not likely that an Arab neighbor of Palestine would
publicly call for the removal of Arafat, and in so doing debase the
symbol of Palestinian nationalism. This would constitute a major
upheaval in the Arab world. On the other hand, everything today is
discussed openly and debated publicly: it would be necessary for an
initial Arab leader to gather the personal courage and demand Arafat's
removal. It could happen.

The main problem is that in the Arab world, violence is acceptable as a
political and even individual weapon. Hence there is a fear of
presenting unorthodox views, coupled with a physical fear. People have
been killed throughout the Arab world for their views, not necessarily
by Palestinians, though Palestinians have employed this method more than
others--in Jordan, Lebanon and Europe.
"
"Pal","Neut","Since it is impossible to cover the complexity of Arab-Palestinian
relations comprehensively in such a short space, I will focus mainly on
relations since the outbreak of the Intifada on September 28, 2000.

From the beginning, Arab states held emergency sessions and regular
meetings of heads of state and foreign ministers in order to monitor the
crisis between the Palestinians and Israeli occupation forces. Egypt
sponsored an emergency summit, then a conference at Sharm El Sheikh,
inviting the belligerent parties and United States President Bill
Clinton to try and find a way out of the conflict. Then came a joint
Egyptian-Jordanian initiative, followed by another Arab summit at which
the Arab states pledged almost a billion US dollars in aid to the
Palestinian Authority. This enabled the Authority to survive at a time
when Israel was reoccupying territory, confiscating financial resources
and demolishing the infrastructure.

The Arab public, too, was stirred to action, calling on everyone to
offer support and donating what they could in aid of their Palestinian
brethren.

It was an expression of the depth and interconnectedness of
Arab-Palestinian relations and demonstrated the centrality of the
Palestinian issue in the hearts and minds of the Arab people.

The Arab initiative demonstrated the maturity reached in Arab political
thought. Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Ben Abdulaziz launched a courageous
initiative at the beginning of 2002, offering a comprehensive political
program of peace, in which he responded to many questions that were on
the minds of Israelis and Westerners on the one hand, and the Arab
people on the other.

The Arab peace initiative was the result of difficult debate and was
undoubtedly the best thing that had happened to Israel since 1948. The
initiative was carefully worded, each letter studied in order to answer
Israelis' questions regarding their future, their fears, dreams and
aspirations. It addressed, in particular, the Arabs' view of Israel and
of a final solution, including a flexible approach to the refugee
problem. Consultations with the Israeli peace camp were ongoing, in
order to judge how the initiative might help convince the Israeli public
of the Arab people's serious desire to deal with Israel as a partner in
the region. The initiative also took into account the suffering of the
Palestinian people, as well as their dreams and legitimate national
aspirations, and those of the Arab world.

Unfortunately, the opportunity was wasted, as both the United States and
Israel callously disregarded what could have been a comprehensive
framework for ending the Arab-Israeli conflict.

This illogical, inexplicable disregard of the proposal did not sway Arab
leaders, who continued--under Egyptian, Saudi and Jordanian
leadership--to support the Palestinians as much as possible and to seek
rational ways for ending the vicious cycle of violence, and the unjust
and arrogant occupation. This was in spite of serious attempts to
exclude them from playing any role, including a role in the Quartet
headed by the United States. The Arabs, however, managed to impose their
presence and convince the parties of the importance of their participation.

The Arab states need to continue supporting the Palestinians, who still
consider peace their strategic option, and negotiations the only path to
a peaceful settlement. They also need to strengthen diplomatic efforts
aimed at finding effective solutions to the ongoing conflict.
"
"Isr","Neut","The day businessman David Apel was indicted for, among other things,
bribing Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Member of Knesset Michael Eitan was
one of the few political personalities from the coalition who agreed to
be interviewed on the subject. Eitan told TV viewers: ""That's the way it
is here; when a right wing prime minister is suspected of corruption the
opposing camp is up in arms--and vice versa"".

Thus Eitan, in a single sentence, captured the total politicization of
Israel's normative system, along with the unbreakable link between it
and the occupation. The ""camp"", after all, is defined first and foremost
on the basis of its attitude toward the occupation or the solution it
prefers for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. All the rest is a
byproduct of this association, including the attitude toward corruption.

This politicization has fouled all objective norms for assessing the
behavior of elected officials and public figures. Within the camp,
tribal style, the rule is to exonerate anyone who has strayed from the
path of righteousness and to demand only the heads of those in the
opposing camp. Even now, when suspicions concerning Sharon's behavior
are piling up daily, only the weak political opposition is calling upon
the prime minister to provide clear answers. The politicians in his own
camp, whose fate depends on his, are silent--as are those who elected
him. They are more frightened of transferring power to the ""enemy camp""
than of the corruption that threatens Israeli society. Thus do money and
power walk hand in hand, unfettered, as long as they take the political
path supported by the majority. What's a ""Greek island""--one of the
cases in which the names of Sharon and his deputy, Ehud Olmert, are
mentioned as recipients of bribes--against the opportunity to prevent a
weakened prime minister from removing a single illegal outpost?

This is not the way to fight corruption, but rather to perpetuate it.
Pretty soon we can replace the Magen David (Star of David) on the
national flag with a yellow banana.

The Israeli collective memory still focuses on the resignation of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin from his first government in 1977 after it was
revealed that his wife maintained an illegal dollar account in an
American bank. That kind of reaction is unthinkable today. In the late
1980s tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets under the slogan
""we're fed up with crooks."" Then, the public reaction to corruption led
to a change in the electoral system, which also failed. But today there
are no such demonstrations. Everything goes: straw non-governmental
organizations that bankroll election campaigns; vote buying; and even an
attempt by a businessman to purchase a Greek island with the help of
politicians. The prevailing public mood holds that everyone is
corrupt--hence those in power should at least be ""our crooks"". For their
part, the ruling circles exploit the security situation and the public's
fear of terrorism and fabricate non-accountable modes of governance.

One factor abetting this atmosphere is the sectoral nature of Israeli
society. Instead of a demanding civil society, we have interest groups.
The public's assets are not considered as deposits held on account for
services rendered to it, but rather as ""catch as catch can"" booty for
specific interest groups. Like soldiers who conquer a village and loot
its TV sets, anyone who takes power pillages whatever assets he/she
finds. The public, for its part, is preoccupied with an existential
struggle to survive, paralyzed by fear of terrorism and groaning under
the yoke of a collapsing economy--itself a direct consequence of the
ongoing occupation. Under these circumstances, it has neither the
strength nor the capacity to demand transparency and accountability from
the government.

Thus does the public cultivate, with its own hands, the fertile soil for
the growth of corruption. The unemployed Israeli, worried sick about
his/her son who is serving in the territories and afraid to get on a
bus, has a hard time delving into the details of the case of Cyril Kern
and the money he gave the prime minister, and has long forgotten the
election bribery cases that implicated MK Naomi Blumenthal.

Midst these bewildering complications, the media plays a strange role.
Corruption cases grab the front-page headlines and thousands of words
are written and spoken daily about them. So what? The media is in any
case suspect of left wing sympathies, of giving expression to the
Palestinian narrative--and the public doesn't really believe what it
reads and hears. Corruption becomes a drama that sells newspapers, and
the contents of the front pages are treated like gossip columns.

No wonder so many are dreaming of a strong leader who'll restore order.
Some are even warning that this is exactly the kind of soil in which
fascism thrives.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: How has the issue of corruption shaped the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict?

A: In fact, it has shaped not the conflict, but our
conception of ""peace"". From the beginning, when Palestinians and
Israelis crafted the Oslo agreement and commenced its implementation,
the Israelis (with the Americans behind them) opened private accounts in
Israeli banks in the name of [Palestinian President Yasser] Arafat, to
which all the taxes collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinian
Authority were diverted. This was the source of all our troubles
concerning corruption.

Q: Why has that damaged Palestinian fiscal management?

A: The Israelis thought that if Arafat was encouraged to be
corrupt and to be satisfied with the money that he received [that way],
he might offer the Israelis more compromises and, therefore, acquiesce
to their demands.

Q: Why do Palestinians make direct links between fiscal
corruption and political corruption, or the abandonment of the
Palestinian cause?

A: The Israelis were really helping the Palestinian
Authority to be corrupt by allowing for these private banking accounts.
The whole aim was to seduce the Palestinian Authority into corruption.
When you are a corrupt person who is also a decision maker, you are
always distracted by where you can steal money, how you can hide the
theft, where you can go with it--I think that any patriot or responsible
leader at any level will experience damaged efficacy and some negative
ramifications just by virtue of an agenda that differs from his work.

Q: There has been a great internal focus on corruption
since then. Do you think that matters have improved?

A: Yes, to a certain extent. I think that [Palestinian
Minister of Finance] Salam Fayyad has tackled the basics of reform in
the financial sector, but he has not yet completed this task
satisfactorily. For example, concerning the investments of the
Palestinian Authority, he [Fayyad] has gained control of some, but we as
the Palestinian Legislative Council have not yet received the complete
report of all of the companies and various investments of the
Palestinian Authority, whether international or public. He promised when
he presented the budget of 2003 that he would have this information for
us 15 days after we were to give our vote of confidence in the budget.
Now one year has passed.

Q: How much does international pressure play into the
process of reform?

A: They set in motion the reforms, but I think that there is
a resistance to true reform on the part of some who are interested in
avoiding a disruption of their practices. There is a resistance to
making these reforms comprehensive and total. Because of that, the
problem lies with the decision makers in the Palestinian Authority.

Q: Does it help when the United States or the European
Union put pressure on the Palestinian Authority?

A: Not the way the Americans are doing it. When you want
someone to tell you ""no"" then you can ask him or her in a manner that
will ensure a negative response. They are bragging about it; they are
talking it up. Especially Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. In
reality, this [approach] damages Palestinians more than it benefits or
encourages them. Both sides could make better use of diplomatic
procedures and processes, rather than this vulgar way of acting.

Q: What do you think that the possible indictment of Ariel
Sharon would do for the issue of corruption?

A: This will help a great deal, really.
"
"Isr","Neut","Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon does not hide his intentions. First
he thought that Israel could hold onto the territories for many more
years, and that the demographic problem that would emerge when
Palestinians become the majority of the inhabitants east of the Jordan
River would be solved by sending them to Jordan (""Jordan is Palestine"")
or by means of mass immigration on the part of western Jewry. In the
course of three years of rule he understood that there is no chance to
turn Jordan into Palestine, and that immigration to Israel declines when
the security and economic situation is bad.

He concluded that what could not be solved by force would be solved by
more force; his policy of force against the Palestinians was not
accompanied by any proposal for a political process. Even the
Palestinian prime ministers, who to a large extent were appointed as a
consequence of his pressure, were never accepted by him as negotiating
partners.

According to Sharon's own testimony, in an interview last week with
William Safire of /The New York Times/, into this political vacuum there
entered undesirable proposals like the Geneva accord, moving him to
present his own plan. He took it from his private archive: a plan from
the early 1980s that already bore his name, the thrust of which was to
establish bantustan-like Palestinian enclaves in the occupied
territories that would enable Israel to rule the land without bearing
the Palestinian demographic burden. Sharon is prepared to implement such
a plan with a willing Palestinian leader. Twenty years ago he tried to
establish the ""village leagues"" and to appoint Mustafa Dudin as their
head to negotiate with him. The experiment failed, of course, and Sharon
is still searching for a congenial Palestinian leader. Not having found
one, he now prefers to implement his plan unilaterally.

Sharon views his plan as a ringing slap in the face to the Palestinians.
He lives in a zero-sum world in which everything good for Israel is bad
for the Palestinians, and vice versa. This is also how he sees US
President Bush's letter to him--as his victory and their loss--and how
he gloats over it for the benefit of members of his party whose support
he seeks in the May 2 Likud referendum.

The Arab world has played right into his hands. Rather than their noting
that what was stated by Bush to Sharon was already proposed to both
sides by President Clinton in December 2000 (settlement blocs,
non-return to the green line, solving the refugee problem in the
Palestinian state, and even a clear statement that acknowledges that
Israel cannot accept the principle of the ""right of return"" in the sense
of return by refugees to sovereign Israel), the letter was understood
precisely as Sharon wanted it to be: as punishment for the Palestinians.
Egyptian President Mubarak, who had met with Bush a few days earlier,
reacted with great displeasure; Jordan's King Abdullah refused to see
Bush, and returned to Jordan from the US west coast without stopping in
Washington; while the Palestinian leadership declared that this was the
end of the peace process.

The truth is that the Bush letter restores the final status settlement
to the Israeli national agenda. Sharon sought to determine that the
roadmap was dead. Bush recommitted himself to the roadmap and to his own
vision. All the achievements that Sharon takes pride in are linked to
final status. No serious observer believes that final status will be
based on anything but two states for two peoples, a new and agreed
border, and a solution under which refugees will not return to Israel.
What at first glance appears to be Bush's acceptance of Sharon's diktat,
is in fact a reformulation of the Clinton plan or the Geneva accord.

What looks to Sharon like an interim agreement that never turns into a
final status accord--since as long as he's setting the agenda Israel
will never have a suitable partner--should now become the first phase in
a process that very quickly leads to a permanent agreement. The more
time this takes, the worse the situation will be: from Israel's
standpoint the demographic balance will change for the worse; from the
Palestinian standpoint the settlements will expand and become yet more
of a fait accompli. The position of Palestinian pragmatists will be
weakened, insofar as they are incapable of providing services and
security to their public.

Those Israelis and Palestinians who believe in an agreement rather than
unilateral moves, along with those in the world who appreciate how the
end of the Middle East conflict will contribute to global stability,
should make every effort to ensure that the departure from Gaza
leverages an ongoing peace process. There is a good chance for success,
given that principles such as the non-removability of settlements are
likely to be violated in the initial stage by the father of the
settlements himself.
"
"Pal","Neut","The foundations of the historic compromise have been shaken in this
cruelest month of April. The president of the United States, publicly
and clearly, redefined the right of return to mean the return to the
yet-to-be-born Palestine. He questioned the ""sanctity"" of the 1967
borders and sanctioned ""reality on the ground"" as a determining factor
for the future of settlements and borders. He committed the United
States to maintain Israel's qualitative edge over the Arabs and praised
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for his bold steps toward peace as
he expressed his solidarity with Israel's fight against terror and its
acts of self-defense as it sees fit.

The Palestinians reacted with a mix of anger and foreboding. They could
hardly recover from the shock before they witnessed the killing of Hamas
leader Dr. Rantisi. Bellicose words were a sad substitute for their
sense of weakness and violation.

The Arab ""street"" as covered by Al Jazeera and other stations overflowed
with emotion and rhetoric, while the Arab states reacted
cautiously--after they expressed their eternal support for the
Palestinians and heaped their usual vitriol on Sharon. Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, fresh from a friendly visit to Texas, stated
that the Arabs' hatred for America was at its all-time high. Jordan's
King Abdullah wisely ""postponed"" his trip to Washington to be
rescheduled in a couple of weeks. The rest of the world dusted off its
usual remarks about peace.

Anger, lamentation and loud expressions of hatred directed against
America and its president and against Israel and the Arab regimes may
help vent anger but are no substitute for strategy. The Palestinians by
now have to come to grips with the fact that the support of Arab and
Muslim masses cannot and will not solve the problem of Palestine. It is
necessary but insufficient.

Palestinians must confront their problems squarely. They are a people
living under an oppressive occupation, with a weakened and isolated
leadership, without an army and with a tattered security force, a
wrecked economy and fractured institutions. The image of defenders of a
just cause has gradually and relentlessly metamorphosed into that of
terrorists. However, the historic injustice meted out to the
Palestinians, continues to define their struggle as the conflict of our
time and therein lies the Palestinian's winning card.

Whatever strategies the Palestinians have utilized in the past have not
worked. It is time to reflect, reassess and innovate. Violence may
preclude a solution but it will not achieve one. The Palestinians alone
cannot liberate Palestine. No people have sacrificed more, or longer,
than the Palestinians have, but sacrifice without a strategy designed to
win is not enough. In a struggle of this magnitude, more allies who, for
their own reasons, share the vision of a state of Palestine alongside
Israel are indispensable. Allies in the United States and in Israel, the
two countries that play a pivotal role in the outcome of this conflict,
have to be identified and mobilized. Violence against civilians
alienates these potential allies and the Palestinian people must make
the fateful choice between military confrontation and peaceful
resistance and negotiations.

The Palestinians must be given the opportunity to make and express their
choices. It is time, it is past time, for the Palestinians to go to the
voting booths and cast their ballots to elect their representatives. The
United States cannot seriously prevent a people from voting. That is as
un-American as the monarchy. The United States, once convinced, can
engage Israel to make elections feasible. All parties need to see that
the compromises required to achieve peace can only be made by elected
representatives. It would help to couple elections with a referendum on
a two-state solution based on the roadmap. The roadmap is the one
international instrument accepted by the Israeli and Palestinian
leadership, as well as by the Quartet and the Arab League. Such a
referendum would define the parameters of the political horizon for the
Palestinians. Opponents of the roadmap will lose their ability to thwart
progress if the referendum wins.

The Palestinians must also make choices about the future of Gaza after
Israel withdraws. Gaza must be made to work, thus depriving Israeli
hawks of an argument to extend the occupation of the West Bank. This
probable withdrawal offers the Palestinians an unusual opportunity, the
opportunity to plan for a future event rather than to cope with a done
deal. It should be viewed as the first milestone in establishing their
viable state. The suggestions put forth by Marwan Barghouti are worthy
of serious consideration. They provide the political context that makes
this withdrawal a step towards independence, rather than a downward
slide to the abyss.

But beyond that, concrete plans for housing, roads, parks, industrial
plants, schools and all aspects of living must be made and readied for
implementation. This project can best be done under the leadership of
international institutions like the World Bank, with active
participation of the Palestinians themselves. A formal new entity can be
entrusted with this task.

Free elections, with issues contested and choices starkly defined, will
make it possible for legitimate representatives to tackle issues of
Palestinian and Israeli security under the indispensable American
umbrella. Egypt and Jordan can and will play significant roles in
bringing this process to fruition.

The president of the United States should be taken at his word that the
final status issues are to be left to the parties. Prejudging the
outcome will not work. Only empowered legitimate representatives of both
peoples will have the authority and ability to make the compromises
needed for peace, and only they can make such peace permanent.
"
"Isr","Neut","Violence in its various forms was and remains the principal permanent
characteristic of the conflict between Jews and Arabs in the Land of
Israel/Palestine since the conflict began in the late 19th century. More
precisely, violence was the most prominent attribute of the Arab
reaction to the political, material and cultural challenge presented by
the Zionist enterprise.

The violence employed by individuals and groups of Palestinian Arabs
against the Jewish settlers was a response to a sense of threat
projected by an immigrant society that was culturally foreign and
possessed an advanced organizational, economic and technological
capability. Moreover, the Zionist enterprise had the goal of turning the
entire country into a Jewish state, with the threat--that over the years
appeared to be a self-fulfilling prophecy--to dislodge the Arabs from
their material and spiritual assets.

Arab violence toward Jews generally involved sporadic, temporary and
uncontrolled popular uprisings, alongside a routine of murders carried
out by individuals acting on their own. Together they evolved into a
mode of violent activity devoid of any distinction between target
categories and directed at civilians. A considerable portion of the more
extended violent Palestinian Arab outbreaks also involved internal
bloodletting; this derived from traditional societal tensions that even
the struggle against the Zionist enemy could not stop.

In the Palestinian collective memory, the extended violence directed
against the Jews became a legitimate weapon within the context of a just
struggle to protect the basic rights of individuals and of a people. The
violent conflict to defend Palestine and its Arab nature against the
Zionist invaders, whether defined religiously as a ""jihad"" or in a
national-secular sense as armed popular struggle, took on a peremptory
moral significance that shaped the consciousness of generation upon
generation within Palestinian society. Thus Sheikh Ez a-Din al-Qassam,
who pioneered the fulfillment of jihad as an obligation for all Muslims,
became both symbol and paragon for the secular and religious Palestinian
resistance movements alike, as they raised the banner of total and
uncompromising struggle against Israel.

Violence and terrorism were always presented by Palestinians as the
weapon of the weak and as a response to aggression by foreign invaders
who were supported by international forces. In the absence of the
capacity to directly confront Israeli security forces, the strategy of
armed struggle that was selected featured political and propaganda
objectives that bore unmistakable characteristics of terrorism against
innocent civilians--who were defined as part of the ""Zionist military
entity.""

The Palestinian national movement has adhered to a violent mode of
action since the mandatory period, despite the failures and disasters
that have befallen it. At the receiving end, violent outbreaks by
Palestinians honed the existential fears of the Zionist founding fathers
and drove them to develop, in any way possible, the political,
organizational and military capacities of the /Yishuv/ (the pre-state
Jewish community in Palestine) and then the State of Israel, in
anticipation of an all-out and decisive confrontation. Indeed,
non-discriminate Arab violence helped develop and rationalize the power
components of Zionism, and to base them on the moral ethos of ""defense"",
""purity of arms"" and the ultimate necessity of the use of force.

Palestinian Arab violence against Jews and Israelis usually featured an
unbridgeable gap between goals and means that inevitably led to
self-destruction. With the exception of the 1929 riots, when the Yishuv
was in real danger, Arab violence and terrorism were not able to strike
a mortal blow at the Zionist enterprise. Nor, with the exception of the
invasion by Arab standing armies in 1948, did the State of Israel ever
confront an existential threat by an Arab military coalition. But in
historical perspective, the violence invoked by generations of
Palestinian Arabs emerges as a disaster for their own national
interests. Even when, in the short term, it appeared that violence had
yielded political fruit, such as the 1939 White Paper or the opening of
a dialogue between the United States and the Palestine Liberation
Organization in 1988 during the first Intifada, in the longer term the
Palestinian national leadership failed the historic test of
distinguishing between vision and reality, and repeatedly missed the
opportunity to achieve part of its objectives.

Nor did the Oslo process bring Palestinian society to recognize the need
to abandon violence and turn to peacemaking, if only in accordance with
a calculation of costs and benefits. Despite bitter historical
experience, the Palestinian leadership continued to rely on the support
of the Arab and Muslim world in its struggle with Israel, and to
anticipate its assistance in internationalizing the conflict. True, the
culmination of the Oslo process bitterly disappointed most of those
Palestinians who supported it from the start. But in the final analysis
the al-Aqsa Intifada will probably not be remembered by many
Palestinians as their greatest hour, and particularly not as the
greatest hour of the Palestinian Authority headed by Yasir Arafat. The
latter was supposed to serve as a responsible national leadership, but
instead acted as a service provider to local entrepreneurs of violence
and terrorism, and adhered to unrealistic sacred ideals rather than
trying to change them.

Palestinian violence and terrorism, which in the current Intifada
reached new heights in terms of frequency of attacks and the scope of
murder of Israelis, are more disastrous than ever, first of all for
Palestinians themselves. Given the extent of loss of life caused both to
them and to Israel, the economic and institutional destruction they have
brought upon themselves, to say nothing of the damage to Israeli public
trust in any sort of agreement with them and the Israeli public's
inclination to rally round right wing forces--it remains only to
contemplate how far along the Palestinians could have been today in
their drive to realize their goals if, prior to and during the first
Intifada, they had adopted a strategy of civil disobedience and
non-violence from the school of thought championed by Gandhi and his
Palestinian disciple, Mubarak Awad.
"
"Pal","Neut","Very few people believe that the ""vision"" of United States President
George W. Bush will be realized through the declared roadmap
                       . This is not only because there are many
formidable and powerful enemies of peace in all camps, and not only
because both publics are in a serious state of mistrust and despair.
Indeed, the roadmap has an inherent structural problem because it is
missing the primary principles that should guide it and does not spell
out the details of the end game.

People on both sides are traumatized by terror and violence and confused
and bewildered by the political haggling. Nobody knows what shape or
borders or viability the Palestinian state will have. No one knows if
there will be refugees returning. And no one knows the fate of Jerusalem.

In order for peace to set sail there should be some guiding principles.
The most important is equality. This is not to say that the conflict is
between two equals. Overwhelming Israeli power and unconditional United
States support have no comparison on the Palestinian side, other than
the tragic balance of terror that has been reached with Israel through
suicide bombing. But neither side should be treated differently from the
other. This principle should be applied in all issues, although
Palestinians may willingly surrender their right to have a military
because they understand that Israelis are obsessed with the fear that
Palestinians will use the arms to take back the Palestinian villages and
towns that are now part of Israel.

It is a matter of principle that Palestinian fighters be granted
recognition and immunity from prosecution in Israel. They believed they
were fighting for their country and people. Both sides' soldiers should
be forgiven and permitted to reenter life as normally as possible, while
allowing room for internal prosecution of ranking officers who ordered
crimes against humanity.

Israel will recognize the Palestinian right to return and Palestinians
will accept the Jews' right of return. If Jews are allowed to return
after 3,000 years, it is only natural that Palestinians have the right
of return after less than six decades. In this respect, no nation, group
or individual can claim the privilege of being ""chosen"". I am, like
every other human being, as chosen as any--and no better than any.

The other principle that both sides must accept is that violence will
only bring violence, that persecuted Jews have in their own way
persecuted Palestinians who in their own way persecuted themselves and
others. Both communities today suffer an endemic state of violence.
During the relatively quiet seven years of Palestinian Authority
governance, violence within Palestinian society rose by 300 percent
every year. Israel has seen a sharp increase in all forms of violence
and today the Israeli army has one of the highest rates of suicide in
the world.

For this reason, the roadmap should include provisions for internal as
much as cross-border reconciliation. Peace means creating a way of life,
not only scripting a treaty between two politicians. Both Israeli and
Palestinian societies must undergo a process of national reconciliation.
Palestinians will have to experience a process of grieving for lost
land, home and loved ones. This period should also include a process for
granting forgiveness and clemency to collaborators with Israel, allowing
them to reenter life as usual.

Too, Israel will have to undergo a process of acknowledging its
responsibility and apologizing for the hurt caused Palestinians, while
taking responsibility for Palestinian compensation. Israel must accept
world condemnation of its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza as the
root of evil. Indeed many Jews have warned against the serious
detrimental and demoralizing effects of oppressing another nation and
subjugating millions of people who simply want their freedom and rights.
Such a brutal and long-standing occupation has produced an inhumane
environment for Palestinians, with horrifying results.

The most tragic development of the current Intifada is the invention and
use of suicide bombing on a horrific scale. Resulting from the
Palestinians' failure to win over the Israelis, suicide bombing is the
ultimate expression of despair, promising not freedom but revenge.
Naturally such operations of ""terror"" have added to the arsenal of
Zionist propaganda that states that Israel is the only and ultimate
victim, aiding further in the repression of Jewish guilt. It is not
surprising that Israel's propaganda machine has managed to link
Palestinian suicide bombing to international terror. Suicide bombing and
the killing of civilians inside Israel is all that is needed to convince
the world that Jews continue to be slaughtered as victims of racial and
religious hatred and of the barbarism of ""those Arabs.""

As part of any peace agreement, Palestinians must accept that murdering
innocent children and women in buses and restaurants in Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem is a crime, one that should be made prosecutable by law. While
suicide bombing is understandably a brutal form of revenge for the
inhumane condition of occupation, this should not justify terror. It is
tragic that suicide bombing of civilians has undermined Islam's message
and the Palestinian demand for freedom.

If peace is a way of life then resistance through peaceful means should
be the Palestinian method of struggle for liberation. A peaceful
resistance would liberate not only Palestine and Palestinians, but also
Israel and Israelis. Peaceful resistance will allow Israelis the chance
to look inward, release their repressed guilt and accept responsibility.
Violence will only force them to look outside for an enemy. And when
Israelis apologize for the crimes committed against Palestinians, it
will help both.

For the Palestinians, this will be their opportunity to feel dignified
by responding with the honorable, ""Yes, we accept your apology and we
accept you."" On the other hand, apology will help Israelis to feel
whole, rehabilitating their injured selves from their grief and loss and
repressed guilt.

"Isr","Neut","Q: Does United States policy in our region--concerning Iraq,
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and democratization--appear to you to
be consistent and beneficial from Israel's standpoint?

A: Each aspect of US policy stands alone, though ultimately they
are linked. Let's begin with Iraq. Here Israel is not an active player.
Of course we have relevant interests; after all, Iraq through its
behavior made itself a sworn enemy of Israel. But we have no quarrel
with Iraq--territorially, for example--and we don't dictate to the
Americans whether or not to attack Iraq. This is not Israel's war; I
don't know how or when the US will engage in it. Of course if Israel is
attacked, God forbid, it must defend itself. But this is not our war.
Nor is there an American-Arab coalition this time that Saddam would want
to dismantle by attacking us as in 1991.

This will also be a struggle over America's capacity to work in advance
to prevent negative developments in the Middle East. If Saddam remains
in place after the war, then we shall be dealing with a new agenda that
will determine the limits of American force, and the world will become a
more dangerous place. But an American victory will oblige the countries
in the region to be more considerate of its policies.

Q: How will the outcome of an American-Iraqi war affect the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict?

A: The Iraqi file is a sad one for the Palestinians. In 1991 they
thought Saladin was bringing them salvation. Since then only Israel has
grown stronger, and the Arab world has been falling apart. Today too
Saddam is intervening in the conflict in his twisted way and the
Palestinian people are paying a price for it. I hope that if Saddam is
removed, another Palestinian delusion will be dispensed with. But this
does not yet dispense with the conflict. The decision is still with the
Palestinians, not the Americans, whether to end the conflict honorably.
Yet in recent years we are witness to the Palestinian leadership
avoiding responsibility, regardless of the Iraqi issue.

Q: Let's move on to American policy in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Consistent? Beneficial?

A: All former American presidents invested great effort and
resources in an attempt to solve the conflict. The current president
apparently has the unique capacity to see complex conflicts as simple
problems. He has identified Arafat as the focal problem for solving the
conflict. This is a very simplistic approach, but perhaps it's the
truth. [US envoy] General Zinni also quickly grasped that you can't
depend on a word Arafat says. Most of the Palestinian leadership is also
of the opinion that Arafat is the problem. Therefore if the reforms
demanded by America are carried out, this will create a genuine change.
US policy--coupled with the ""quartet's"" activities and pressures from
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, internal Palestinian activity and
judicious activity by Israel--can create a chance for significant reform.

Q: And US policy regarding democratization in the Arab world?

A: Like any democrat body and soul--one who has even changed some
of his positions regarding the conflict in view of the supreme
democratic imperative without which I can't live, regarding human
rights, the rule of the majority, and so forth--I want the Arab
countries to be democratic too. But there are almost no such Arab
states, and this is a worrisome phenomenon. This American goal is good
and vital and positive, but we must not condition everything on
democratization. If [Syrian President Bashar] Assad shows up tomorrow
and offers us peace ""with the borders that you want,"" I don't suggest
that we tell him ""no, no, not until you're a democrat."" After all we're
talking about a struggle between civilizations.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: Where do you think that American policy is going right now
vis a vis the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?

A: I think that the administration is still in major disarray
following the elections themselves and the court appointment of United
States President Bush and the events of 9-11. The election process that
brought Bush to the presidency sent a message to President Bush that he
needs to appease the pro-Israeli lobby in the States in order to secure
a second round of elections and I think that this has been dictating his
administration's policy since day one.

Also, after 9-11, the administration has been unable to define what the
""enemy"" of the United States actually is. One day, it is the so-called
""axis of evil"" and the next day it is the Palestinians and next it is
the Iraqis and the Koreans. I think these two issues have dictated
disarray in setting administration foreign policy.

Q: What do you think that US business interests are in this
region and are they being facilitated?

A: I think that the United States is still in need of a
macro-archenemy and economically has not progressed beyond the Cold War
mindset. In the eighties, there was the telecom deregulation. That
promised the moon to the US economy, but it turned out that the bubble
burst. Look at the nineties with the exaggerated internet market.
Another bubble, but it burst. In the new century, we were looking at a
new bubble in biotechnology industry.

All of these false attempts to recreate the US economy, in my view,
point to the fact that the US is still in a military industrial complex
mindset. For that military industrial complex to work, it needs a
foreign enemy. If you look at the Bush administration per se, with his
cabinet and himself and their affairs with big business ventures that
are tied to the military, it becomes even more clear that there is still
an-old style economy in the States that is looking for someone to prey
upon abroad.

I don't think that US policy is serving average Americans, or even
average corporate America--not big business, but corporate America. The
interest of the average American or business is to have political and
economic stability and that can only come with a Palestinian-Israeli
resolution.

Q: Do you see any successes in US Middle East policy over the
last two years?

A: I think, to be frank, US policy towards the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict has failed. Unfortunately, no one has taken responsibility for
it. We are watching the administration try to grab for air and it is
doing a very poor job at it.

Q: What are Palestinians saying about a US attack on Iraq?

A: People are worried that a US strike on Iraq may give a green
light to the Sharon government to proceed in his plan of two years and
going of destroying anything Palestinians have achieved, whether that be
the Palestinian Authority or anything associated with the state-building
process that we have been in for the last ten years. Such an attack, I
think, would move the world's attention away from the
Palestinian-Israeli issues--which happen to be the core issues--to Iraq.
This could be catastrophic for our region.

Q: Do you have any predictions about what could unfold?

A: Everything being discussed on the street--and what the media has
exposed lately--is that the Sharon government may try a mass expulsion
of Palestinians into Jordan. This is something that Sharon has dreamed
and written and spoken about throughout his entire political life.

Personally, I think that won't happen--that's an extreme. I think that
other potential ramifications may just be a continued slow destruction
process. Gaza has not yet been entered [by the Israeli army] as the West
Bank has been. A strike on Iraq could be the perfect pretext.
"
"Isr","Neut","Between the lines of United States Secretary Colin Powell's Kentucky
speech were some compelling messages to both Israelis and Palestinians.
For the Israelis the message was clear and stark: choose between peace
and security on the one hand, and the occupation with the settlements in
place on the other hand. You cannot have both. For the Palestinians the
choice was equally clear: either a continuation of the violence or a
move back to negotiations for a political settlement. Again, no way for
both to proceed together.

A masterful balancing act, one could say. The gauntlet was thrown down
to both sides. Yet the Secretary's careful choice of words could not
hide the pent-up frustration that the US administration is feeling with
both Palestinians and Israelis. That feeling is particularly strong with
regard to one person--Yasir Arafat. I met with some administration
officials in Washington recently and the criticism I heard of Arafat was
devastating. His failure to halt the violence, to arrest the
ringleaders, and to take more drastic action against the extremist
dissident groups is seen in Washington as an almost historical
disservice he is doing to his own people and the main cause for the
present impasse. Hence the humiliation that Arafat suffered at the hands
of President Bush in New York.

Nor is Ariel Sharon conceived to be much better. His Czechoslovakia
speech will be long remembered, and his procrastinating ploys aimed to
delay implementing the Mitchell plan are one of the main causes for the
frustration felt when dealing with the Arab-Israel conflict. There
exists a strong inclination to say ""a plague on both your houses"" and to
wait for an eventual settlement when Palestinians and Israelis have
different leaders. However, since September 11 that luxury is no longer
possible; hence Secretary Powell's Kentucky commitment to keep General
Zinni and Undersecretary Burns in the region until violence ends and
progress is made. That particular operational input in the speech
elevated it from a generalized vision of a better future for the Middle
East into an urgent plan of action.

It has become all to plain in Washington that the only possible way a
ceasefire can be attained and a possible political settlement reached,
is with an energetic and forceful involvement on the part of the US in
the proceedings. Without it, neither Arafat nor Sharon are capable of
pulling their people out of the quagmire that the present stalemate has
become.

They realize, moreover, that the guidelines for a settlement exist. They
were formulated by President Clinton in the last days of his presidency.
It can be stated with reasonable certainty that the Palestinians will
not accept less and the Israelis will not agree to give up more. Neither
side was happy with the Clinton formula; for the present Israeli
government the Clinton proposals are completely unacceptable. The road
to achieving that objective will therefore be a long and tortuous one,
with many obstacles on the way. The journey will have to be made in
stages, with the opening stages being an effort to bring an end to the
violence and a freeze on all settlement-building. The road will then
become more uphill, and only with a tenacious and insistent involvement
of the US can the end objective be reached--peace and security, and an
end of the occupation. The importance of Secretary Powell's speech is
that, for the first time since the Bush administration took over the
reins of power in Washington, the promise of such an involvement was
made. It remains to be seen how effective it will be.
"
"Pal","Neut","My gut feeling tells me that when United States President George W. Bush
wakes up in the morning and gets his daily foreign policy briefing from
Condoleeza Rice, his immediate reaction to news from the Middle East is
thus: ""To hell with both the Arabs and the Israelis. I just wish the
bastards would finally get themselves together and fade away."" (The
president's words are likely to be much choicer than these, of course).

My guess is that the president has no kind feelings towards either
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat or Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon. Nor does he probably have much respect for the various Arab
leaders he must engage.

Nevertheless, as much as the US administration has tried to avoid it,
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict keeps forcing itself forward. The
Americans would rather focus on their ""war on terrorism,"" scoring one
""victory"" after another, and in the process promoting American imperial
power as never before. The conflict is perceived as a no-win situation
for any American president. Remember how hard former president Clinton
""tried"" and how much time he ""invested,"" only to be rebuffed? Bush is
not about to repeat the same mistake.

But Bush is being pressured to get involved by his Arab allies, who are
in desperate straits and whose own survival as corrupt regimes is now in
question as a result of the Palestinian Intifada and its brutal handling
by the Israeli government. Furthermore, no matter how hard American
politicians and commentators try to avoid a link between Israel's
behavior and American policy in the region, on the one hand, and the
growth of severe alienation that spawns anti-American acts of terror on
the other hand, the very intensity of the conflict keeps reminding the
world that there is, indeed, a connection.

If, therefore, it is impossible to tackle a problem in a substantive
way, one can at least offer a nod toward symbolic politics. One can try
to remove the problem from the television screens and front pages of the
newspapers. One can try to reshape perceptions and get the parties to
""reduce violence"" and engage in some kind of ""peace process""--albeit,
one probably leading nowhere. And one can mount a major public relations
campaign by sending your foreign-service officers who speak broken
Arabic to appear on television to better explain the American position.

After Colin Powell's speech, these emissaries have quite a bit more
ammunition. Americans will now be presented to the world, not only as
warriors who condone atrocities by their Northern Alliance friends and
mercilessly bomb miserable Afghani civilians, but also as noble
peacemakers.

There are currently many objective conditions, on the level of American
and even Israeli public opinion, which might enable the American
government to push for a fair settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. But I am reasonably sure that President Bush and his
administration lack the courage and will to confront the Israeli
government and to push it toward meaningful compromise. They are not
willing to incur that confrontation's political cost. Further, in
Israel, there is no anchor for an American initiative--foreign minister
Shimon Peres cannot offer it and the Labor party is in disarray. .

Despite these negatives, Palestinians must engage in the new process in
an intelligent and proactive manner. To be taken seriously, Palestinians
must address their severe internal problems--eliminate rampant
corruption, establish a system of law and invest in the welfare and
education of their people. At the same time, Palestinians must mount an
effective, coordinated and well-focused campaign aimed at reaching
important segments of the American and Israeli public.

After all, Secretary Powell has articulated what Palestinians have been
calling for: namely, a viable Palestinian state alongside Israel, an end
to the occupation and settlements, an end to the killing of innocent men
and women, and an end to the closures that have turned daily life into
hell for the Palestinian people. These are important objectives for
Palestinians to focus on and of which to repeatedly remind the United
States administration.

"
"Pal","Neut","In outlining the effects of the ongoing sequence of events since
September 2000 on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, one
needs to be careful in specifying exactly what is impacting what, rather
than dealing with the effects in isolation from their causes. This is
necessary to avoid falling into the trap of blaming the victim, a
phenomenon that is a characteristic of much of the current uncritical
political narrative.

Therefore, when comparing the socioeconomic situation as it existed
previously to the current situation, we need to remind ourselves that
the underlying cause of the dramatic deterioration is not the intifada
as such, but the policies adopted by successive Israeli governments to
crush the intifada and thwart its aims. The basic aims of the second
intifada (like those of the first) were not more extensive than ending
the occupation and all that has come with it: colonial settlement
building on stolen land engulfing Palestinian population centers; daily
humiliation; obstruction of the autonomous development of Palestinian
society; and, in short, standing in the way of Palestinians exercising
their right to self-determination.

A central element of the Israeli government's strategy of crushing the
intifada consists of subjecting the population to extreme economic
hardship. This has been implemented through a series of measures. First,
Israel has closed to Palestinian labor the Israeli labor market, which
before the intifada employed a quarter of the Palestinian labor force.
Second, the Israeli government has fragmented Palestinian society by
blockading its towns, villages and camps, thus making it impossible--or
at best extremely difficult--for labor and commodities to move from one
area to another. Third, the Israeli government has demolished the
Palestinian Authority's (PA) central institutions and the minor symbols
of sovereignty that the PA brought with it. This was accomplished by
withholding from the PA its financial dues and systematically destroying
its material and institutional infrastructure.

The results are that unemployment rates have jumped from about 10
percent just before the eruption of the intifada to five or six times
that rate (depending on what definition one uses for employment).
Consequently, the poverty rate--which is set by the World Bank at $2 per
day per person--shot up from 20 percent in 1999 to about 50 percent
towards the end of 2002, and is likely to keep rising as savings and
other resources are exhausted. Poverty is what the future holds for most
people as both the public and private sectors are weakened and their
resources used up. Losses in the private sector have been enormous both
in terms of productive capacity (and thus employment capacity) and in
terms of investments, both local and external.

The Palestinian public sector was heavily hit as its tax revenues
dwindled to half their pre-intifada level and as donor assistance began
to fall off. The ability of the PA to provide basic services (education,
health, personal security and social assistance) has received a very
hard knock on the head. The result of all this has been rapidly
declining standards of living, increasing poverty and the rapid spread
of malnutrition and anemia, particularly among children, the elderly and
women. The PA's monthly scrambling to pay the salaries of its employees
(including teachers, policemen and health workers) adds to individual
families' feelings of insecurity and duress. This is further enhanced by
the military reoccupation of most Palestinian areas and daily sorties
against the civilian population (assassinations, arrests, house
demolition, curfews, etc.). All this makes Palestinian society a very
""high risk society.""

The Israeli strategy under the Sharon government to use the maximum
possible economic, political, military and security pressures to quell
the intifada has succeeded in creating untold suffering and misery among
the Palestinian civilian population, but has also failed miserably to
address the roots of the intifada--the Israeli military occupation,
colonization and apartheid policies. There is sufficient evidence in
history to show that repression, starvation and humiliation do not stop
people from dreaming of their freedom or diminish their readiness to die
for it.
"
"Isr","Neut","Judging by the economic indicators, Yasir Arafat and his colleagues in
the Palestinian leadership plainly did not plan in advance or even
anticipate the outbreak of the bloody confrontations that came to be
known as the al-Aqsa Intifada. The most striking indicator is the
billions of dollars invested by the Palestinians in tourism enterprises
toward the year 2000--the year that produced the Intifada.

In the ambitious ""Bethlehem 2000"" project alone that climaxed in the
visit of the Pope to Bethlehem, more than two billion dollars were
invested. New and luxurious hotels were built in the city of Jesus's
birth, along with a modern bus terminal and a conference center;
infrastructure for various services was installed and hospitality and
entertainment centers were opened. Similar investments in tourist
projects were made in Jericho, Ramallah and even Gaza. A large portion
of the funding for these projects came from external sources, from the
countries that contributed to the Palestinian Authority. But large
private and public investments were also made by the Palestinians
themselves.

Needless to say, the tourism industry is the most sensitive of all to
security events. In other words, whoever invests such huge sums in
tourism not only is not planning violent events, but indeed does not
even imagine that something like a war is about to break out. Thus we
can state unequivocally that the economy of the Palestinian Authority in
its short duration (1994-2000) was built as a peace economy.

There are other aspects of the Palestinian economy that offer an
explanation of sorts for the outbreak of the Intifada. A brief survey of
the development of the Palestinian economy should also explain why so
much attention is now being paid to the corruption rampant within
Palestinian institutions.

The Oslo agreement of September 1993 was signed at a time when a degree
of separation was developing between the Palestinian economy in the West
Bank and Gaza and the Israeli economy. Following the Israeli occupation
of the territories, and in the course of over 20 years, near total
integration was instituted between the economies of the Palestinian
territories and Israel. Relations between the small and relatively
backward Palestinian economy and Israel's large and modern economy were
completely asymmetrical.

It was Israel's minister of defense during the 1967 war, Moshe Dayan,
who presided over the process of integrating the two economies, based on
the free passage of goods between them. This generated the near total
dependency of the Palestinian economy on that of Israel. Its main
feature was the employment in Israel of half the Palestinian work force.
Masses of laborers from the Gazan refugee camps and the villages of
Judea and Samaria commuted daily to Israel to work in construction,
agriculture, services and industry. This generated a process of rapid
economic growth in the West Bank and Gaza. In 1986, some 20 years after
the territories were occupied, Palestinian per capita income had reached
22 percent of that in Israel. In other words the Palestinians' economic
situation, relative to Israel's, increased significantly during these
years, and their income began to close the gap with incomes in Israel.

It was in the course of the crisis generated by the Gulf War of early
1991 that closures were first imposed on the territories. But the
dramatic change in the relationship between the economy of the
territories and that of Israel came about with the Oslo Agreement and
the establishment of Palestinian autonomy. Palestinian laborers could no
longer enter Israel freely. Closure became a permanent matter of
principle. Instead of integration between the two economies, rules of
economic separation were developed against a backdrop that was both
political and security-motivated.

The establishment of Palestinian rule on the West Bank and in Gaza was
accompanied by great expectations for economic growth. The ensuing
disappointment was equally great. Separation from Israel through closure
generated high rates of Palestinian unemployment. Tens of thousands of
Palestinian workers stood beyond the fences and the roadblocks and
pondered how the peace process had created a situation whereby guest
workers from Rumania, China and Thailand were taking their places.

Following the Oslo Agreement, large sums of money flowed to the
Palestinian Authority to finance national projects involving tourism,
communications industries, an airport at Rafah, the first stages of
constructing a seaport at Gaza, and offshore gas production. But this
could not replace sources of employment in Israel. Only the Palestinian
ruling elite benefited financially. Senior PA officials also received
benefits from Israel: free passage at roadblocks and concessions for
advancing commercial projects and monopolies.

The Gazan and West Bank lower classes became poorer and poorer. In 1998,
four years after Palestinian rule was established, per capita income in
the PA had dropped back to a low of 10 percent vis-a-vis that in Israel.
The Palestinian economy had been set back some 20 years.

Widespread instances of corruption and waste within PA institutions also
emerged. Even more important was the impression that these phenomena
made on the masses of unemployed and poor. A critical crisis of
confidence developed between them and the ruling elite. Bitterness and
jealousy generated endless stories and gossip about the luxurious life
of those enjoying the privileges of rule at the expense of the suffering
of the masses. These socioeconomic circumstances played a key role in
the outbreak of the Intifada, and continue to exercise decisive
influence on the widespread demands for reform and elimination of
corruption within the ruling institutions of the Palestinian
Authority.
"
"Pal","Neut","With the eruption of the confrontations in September 2000 and the
subsequent tight closures of the Palestinian territories, the slim and
unsustainable recovery begun by the Palestinian economy in 1998 came to
an abrupt halt. In the 20 or so months since then, the economy has been
decimated. The Israeli economy has also been negatively affected,
although unlike that of Palestinians, it is far ahead of barely surviving.

Does Israel want a proletariat revolution in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip and against whom? Is the Israeli objective to test the accuracy of
modern weapons against suburban revolutions as Alain Joxe suggested in
his May 19 lecture, ""Countering Israel's role in the strategy of
hegemony,"" at Birzeit University? Or are mere security concerns on the
minds of the Israeli government?

The economic war waged against the Palestinian people is part of
Israel's military and political war aimed at tiring Palestinians and
bringing them to their knees. In the words of Israeli commentator for
Yedioth Ahranot Ron Ben Eshai, ""It is impossible to vanquish the Al Aqsa
Intifada military, but it is definitely possible to frustrate it and to
wear out the Palestinians physically and economically until it dies out.""

The strict land, sea and air blockade imposed on the 1967 Palestinian
territories and between all Palestinian cities and villages is placing a
stranglehold on the economy and its future prospects. The closure
prevents 125,000 day laborers from getting to their jobs in Israeli
markets. The resulting daily losses in remittances have been estimated
at $3.4 million dollars, which removes a principal source of income for
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). In 1999, those 125,000 workers
contributed $1.3 billion dollars to the Gross National Product - a
fourth of the total. The World Bank estimates the total loss in
Palestinian GNP at $2.4 billion in real terms from September of 2000
until the end of December 2001.

In addition, more than 200,000 workers in the domestic economy are now
unable to go to work due to the closure of roads between Palestinian
towns. Even those who can get to work have not maintained the same level
of contracts, wages or salaries. The percentage of unemployment in the
occupied territories ranges between 40 to 50 percent, making the very
concept irrelevant. The ratio of poverty in these areas is now
unprecedented. The World Bank speaks of 1.5 million people living below
the poverty line of two dollars a day.

This mounts to pauperizing the masses. Workers are thriving to survive
under unbelievable conditions of suffocation. The result is obvious:
continuous violence. The reaction is obvious: armed incursion and heavy
military response for what Israel proudly calls the ""destruction of
terror infrastructure."" It is a vicious circle.

The full blockade has virtually suspended the import of goods to the
territories from abroad (including Jordan and Egypt), and between
cities, not to mention the internal trade. Construction activities, the
leading sector in the nineties, have come to a halt. Only those
engineering firms fulfilling contracts with the PNA for a few European
Union- or Japan-funded projects still have something to do. Tourism that
was to flourish in peace is nearly dead. Those who built hotels,
restaurants and so on have lost hope. The agricultural sector has been
severely damaged, resulting in un-harvested crops and oversaturated West
Bank and Gaza Strip markets. Fishing has been banned in Gaza, depriving
hundreds of families from their main source of income.

Total losses to Palestinian infrastructure have amounted to more than
$750 million since the beginning of the confrontations.

The PNA is effectively bankrupt, since tax revenues have dwindled to one
fifth of previous levels. There is a sharp drop in PNA revenue
collections associated with declining economic activity and disrupted
tax administration, as well as Israel's suspension since December 2000
of the transfer of tax revenues collected on the PNA's behalf (over $500
million at that time) and increasing emergency expenditures,
particularly in the health sector.

The present situation is unsustainable. Households have in many cases
exhausted their savings and capacity to borrow. Emergency employment
schemes, for all their merits, have not significantly dented
unemployment. The fiscal situation continues to deteriorate, and donor
contributions have not closed the budget deficit. Up to now the PNA has
managed this deficit by borrowing from commercial banks, cutting
salaries, squeezing operating costs and delaying the payment of bills,
but all of these strategies are reaching their limit. By the end of
2001, the PNA's arrears amounted to $430 million, most of these owed to
Palestinian commercial suppliers (in turn placing significant pressure
on Palestinian commercial banks). Significant health and environmental
issues are arising with the increase in poverty.

Since the occupation in 1967, Israeli policy has continued to attempt to
bind the occupied territories to the Israeli economy, both as a source
of cheap labor and a captive market for its goods and services. The
territories make up the third biggest buyer for Israeli exports,
importing $2 billion worth of Israeli goods annually while exporting
only $250 million in exchange. Hence the renewed interest of the Israeli
and Palestinian bourgeoisie in returning to the ""peace process"" and
cementing the economic subjugation of the Palestinians. The continuity
of the confrontations constitutes an enormous source of danger to the
Israeli economy and its investments.

Yes, security remains the top priority on the Israeli agenda. But the
economy of confrontations tells us that squeezing Palestinians
economically is a backfiring weapon against the Israeli economy itself
inasmuch as the ""war on terror"" creates a vicious never-ending circle of
violence. What is left, after all, is the fact that peace can only be
achieved through genuine efforts at the negotiations table to achieve
development, so that the process of twinning peace and development can
create the social base for a long-lasting peace.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: UNGAR 194 ""resolves that the refugees wishing to return
to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be
permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date"". How do you address
this demand?

A: The background is the war of 1948 when the refugee problem was
created. It was a zero-sum game. What victors did to vanquished in wars
all through history was done in this war. The Arabs were victorious in
about 20 battles; they erased Jewish villages and towns, deported the
civilians and made them into refugees. The best known of those victories
were in the Etzion Bloc where four villages were destroyed and their
occupants deported, and in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of
Jerusalem, where the victorious Arabs destroyed all the houses and some
of the most sacred synagogues and even took Jewish tombstones from the
holiest graveyard of the Jewish people, where my great great grandfather
is buried, and made them into paving stones. The Jews were victorious in
400 places. We did the same thing. We destroyed houses, some mosques,
and deported people and made them into refugees. That's the whole
terrible story in a nutshell. This war created hundreds of thousands of
refugees. I acknowledge their misery, but not the blame. This was war,
as it has been fought all over the globe and all over history.

Q: So you're citing historical precedent?

A: You can't turn back the clock of history after such a war,
because if you give the right of return you bring havoc to the whole
very delicate balance of humanity. The war of 1948 was the outcome of
the events of WWII where I was a soldier. Millions of Russian and German
refugees were deported. If you go by the right of return rule, then they
should all claim the right of return to what is now Poland, to
Koenigsberg (Kaliningrad) in eastern Prussia, to the Sudetenland in the
Czech Republic. The same goes for India and Pakistan, where millions
were deported and have no right of return. I speak as one of those who
were in charge of settling hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees in
Israel; I built entire regions in Israel to absorb refugees. More than
half of Israelis are refugees and their children, including myself; I
arrived in Palestine at age three. Both peoples have a large refugee
proportion. We resettled them, and so can the Palestinians, with modern
technology and a Marshall Plan.

Q: Many moderate Palestinians ask that Israel accept a
small, symbolic number of Palestinian refugees.

A: The greatest symbol is a big Marshall plan for the refugees.
Accepting a symbolic few will bring only terrible envy to those not
included. This means more friction and more hatred.

Q: UNGAR 194 also resolves ""that compensation should be
paid for the property of those [refugees] choosing not to return and for
loss of or damage to property"". How do you view this demand for
compensation?

A: My view derives from what I said before. We don't accept blame.
The problem of the refugees was the outcome of two sides fighting each
other. There is no parallel here, say, to WWII, where the Nazis
destroyed a helpless Jewish people who were not at war with them, after
which Germany agreed to compensate the survivors.

Q: Successive Israeli governments since David Ben Gurion
have agreed to the compensation principle.

A: When Ben Gurion and others were ready for compensation they
thought this would solve the whole conflict. Since then we've had 50
years of mutual bloodshed. By the way, if each refugee gets a certain
sum in compensation it won't help to solve the problem. We need billions
of dollars.

Q: These views are very different from those of the Israeli
left of which you are a prominent member.

A: This is not entirely true. The Geneva Accord has a clause that
Israel will not bear the burden of solving the problem, but also an
outlet for a minimal number of refugees to be resettled. I oppose this.
I prefer the Nusseibeh-Ayalon program which states clearly that no
Palestinians will settle in Israel and no Jews will settle in Palestine.

Q: You are a pioneer of Israeli-Palestinian dialogue, going
all the way back to 1976 when you began talking with Issam Sartawi, a
close aide of Arafat. How do Palestinians react to your views?

A: I told Sartawi the very same thing. He and others understood
it, as does Nusseibeh today. I reject Israeli government schemes for
compensation. I prefer a big Marshall Plan, with Israeli participation.
I prefer to build modern towns with thousands of houses for refugees.

Q: Isn't this a form of collective compensation?

A: This is not collective compensation. I don't want to use the
word compensation, but rather for us to act as good neighbors, and on a
big scale, together with the West, the wealthy Arab states, etc. This
vision of a grand Marshall Plan should be put into the future agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians. It should be signed by the future
donors. It should be of a magnitude of $100 billion. This makes personal
compensation look marginal. On the other hand suppose, God forbid, the
Palestinians have their way and about two million refugees settle, say,
in Kiryat Gat, which was pre-1948 Fallujah. I built Kiryat Gat. They'll
have to deport the Jewish refugees who live there and were settled by
me. Then we have to destroy the Intel and Indigo hi-tech plants and
erase Kiryat Gat and create the new Fallujah. This means the destruction
of Israel in no time.
"
"Pal","Neut","The right of return of Palestinian refugees to their place of origin is
enshrined in four separate bodies of international law: humanitarian
law; human rights law; the law of nationality as applied to state
succession; and refugee law. Beyond these laws, which apply to all
refugees in the world, the UN General Assembly specified the Palestinian
case in Resolution 194                                            ,
paragraph 11 which sets forth a framework for a solution to the problem
of Palestinian refugees, including the possibility of return: ""The
refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their
neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date,
and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing
not to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under
principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the
Governments or authorities responsible.""

To understand the importance of the refugee issue to Palestinians, we
must in addition understand that the Palestinian nation and Palestinian
nationalism as it exists today was born with the expulsion of more than
half the Palestinian people from their land in 1948 and one of the
fundamental aspects of Palestinian identity is ""refugeehood."" Such an
understanding obliges us to address the problem of the Palestinian
refugees as fundamental to any solution of the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict.

There are five reasons for this:

First, as long as the Israelis do not take into consideration what
happened to the Palestinians in 1948 and the expulsion of the indigenous
population from 78 percent of the land of historic Palestine, they will
keep bargaining about the remaining 22 percent (the West Bank including
east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip). There is no solution to the land
issue without coupling it to the refugee issue. This may be the reason
why Oslo failed.

Secondly, resolving the refugee issue is not just a technical matter of
absorption nor is it a matter of reciting international law like
reciting the Koran. Rather, it is to deconstruct the whole
Palestinian-Israeli conflict to its very premises, to understand how its
causes led to a certain kind of colonial practice, and to recognize the
need for a debate, not just to understand, but to acknowledge and accept
historic responsibility. This is the very precondition for any true
reconciliation and mutual forgiveness, as suggested by Edward Said.

Third, irrespective of whether the final resolution of the conflict
takes the form of a two-state or a bi-national state solution, the
refugee issue cannot be considered secondary. The current intifada has
revealed the importance of the refugees; they are the social and
political actors most unable to bear the impasse in the Oslo process.

Fourth, beyond the moral and symbolic value of realizing the right of
return, the right is useful in creating a framework for providing
refugees with a choice between remaining in their host countries,
returning to their places of origin or coming to a future Palestinian
state (or third countries). The right of choice is a necessity for those
who have, for half a century, been forced to live as aliens without
basic rights in miserable camps and in states that have not always
embraced them with open arms.

Finally, if the right of return and the right of choice is accepted, it
will open many possibilities for the refugees to choose from. The
movement of refugees depends on many factors related to the social,
economic, cultural and identity spheres. The return of refugees does not
mean that the whole refugee community will move. In almost all cases,
the experience of refugees across the world shows that the number of
those who return is less than those who choose other solutions. The
Israeli phobia to return is unjustified.

Hannah Arendt, in her study of totalitarianism, reminds us of ""the
decision of statesmen to solve the problem of statelessness by ignoring
it."" She insisted on the necessity of examining displacement through the
prism of often xenophobic nation states, and she traced the political
and symbolic logics that had the effect of pathologizing and even
criminalizing refugees. The contemporary linkage that has been forged
between Palestinian return and a disturbance of the regional order,
especially in Israel, attests to the continuing relevance of Arendt's
point.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What is the meaning of UNGAR 194?

A: It's very clear what the meaning of UNGAR 194
                                            is and there has been little
controversy over its meaning except among legal experts and politicians
on the Israeli side who have been trying to reinterpret it. But
generally there is consensus among the expert community and the
international community what UNGAR 194 means. It affirms the right of
those refugees who wish to return to return to their homes and
properties and receive compensation, and for those who do not wish to
return to have the option of resettlement and compensation elsewhere.

This is very much in line with the principles that are usually applied
to solving refugee problems the world over. In that sense, UNGAR 194 is
nothing exceptional. It is very much in line with principles applied in
peace agreements especially recent peace agreements. The fact that we
have these ongoing arguments over what this resolution and what the
right of return means I see more as a way to try to avoid the real issues.

Q: One of the reasons people say UNGAR 194 does not imply
the right of return is because it is not explicitly stated in there.
Where does the right come in?

A: The resolution states that refugees who wish to return should
have the possibility of doing so and basically affirms existing
international law. General Assembly resolutions don't establish rights;
they are passed based on existing international law. This is what UNGAR
194 does. It affirms that refugees who wish--and here we have the issue
of the choice which is very important--should be able to return and
those who do not should be offered other options. The fact that it does
not state the right per se is meaningless.

Q: The right of return has often been portrayed as a deal
breaker in terms of a Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement. What are your
thoughts on that?

A: Two things here. First of all, and unfortunately, I think we
have never reached a stage in peace negotiations where everything was
resolved except for the right of return of the refugees. So in that
sense you cannot call it a deal breaker because there are still many
other issues that people say are so easily resolved--the settlements,
sovereignty--where we haven't seen any negotiated solutions yet. So it
may be a little premature to declare this issue as a deal breaker.

On the other hand, it is maybe the most substantial question, because it
does not fit into the framework of separating Palestinian Arabs and
Israeli Jews on territorial lines. Palestinian refugee rights are not
situated in the 1967 occupied territories. In that sense it is
particularly challenging because it is maybe the one issue where major
concessions are required from the Israeli side so that an Israel after a
peace agreement couldn't be the same as the Israel we have now.

Q: Israelis say the fulfillment of the right of return
would mean the end of Israel as a Jewish state. What would you say to them?

A: I think what we really need is a discussion over the solution
of the refugee issue as an issue of conflicting rights. Instead of
always arguing over whether Palestinian refugees have a right of return
or not, we should look at the rights they have--which is the right to
return to housing and property, restitution and compensation--and look
on the Israeli side and see what kind of rights we have there. We have
to look at the right of Israel to be a Jewish state, which is situated
on the level of collective rights, if there is one, i.e. whether Israel
in fact under international law has a right to maintain a Jewish state.
And we have to look at the level of individual rights, the rights of
Israeli Jews who have been living on refugee property for so many years
under specific conditions, and maybe have invested and have ownership
etc. These are the things you normally look at in other refugee cases
and conflicts where refugees return. You have to ask what are the rights
on both sides, and then these have to be balanced. This is where we have
compromises, not on the level of the rights per se.

Q: In recent years we have seen a number of unofficial
peace initiatives--the Geneva Accords or the Nusseibeh-Ayalon
agreement--in which it seems the right of Palestinian refugees to return
have been seriously compromised. What is your position on such efforts?

A: The problem with these proposals is that they suggest a
political deal that should be made by the leaderships on both sides, and
in both cases, refugee rights, which are individual rights, are
massively ignored and violated. In that sense they are extremely
problematic, and there is probably no Palestinian leadership, which
wants to remain legitimate, that could pass such a deal. Nor is it not
the way refugee problems have been resolved in other cases. This is why
I think it is so important to look at comparative studies and learn from
other experiences. If there is a serious approach to resolving this
issue, of course we will benefit from the experience of other regions
and cases.

The problem with the Israeli side is that there has been an effort to
block even debates on this level and to just keep arguing over whether
Palestinian refugees have rights or not. It is more comfortable to
propose deals where these rights are either put away by political
decision--Nusseibeh-Ayalon--or interpreted in such a way that they
become meaningless, and this won't lead anywhere.

Q: There are also those who argue that Palestinians have to
make a choice between the right of return or the two-state solution.
What do you think?

A: It's a very hypothetical question. So far we haven't seen in
past negotiations an Israeli government that explicitly said it was for
a two-state solution and for a Palestinian state, and all the activities
on the ground have always suggested the opposite. How should
Palestinians make these choices, when it's so abstract? If the situation
in the Oslo years had developed in such a way that both sides had agreed
to a sovereign state of Palestine in the 1967 occupied territories, and
settlements had been frozen and gradually dismantled, then maybe there
would have been a Palestinian leadership that could legitimately and
with popular support have made a deal on refugee rights. But since we
never had such a situation, it is very abstract to even think of such
scenarios. What kind of guarantees do people have that if they give up
their right of return they will have a sovereign state?

Q: Assuming the right of return is not going to be
implemented any time soon, what should be done in the short term? For
example, could there be an international community decision to resettle
people and pay compensation without prejudicing their possible future
statuses?

A: There are lots of things that could be done in the meantime.
There are two things in particular that are very obvious and would be
very helpful.

The first is if the whole current international system of refugee
protection was reviewed and improved when it comes to Palestinian
refuges. We have a situation where Palestinians are very much left out
of the international protection system that was set up under the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Palestinian refugees
need an agency that is not only providing assistance the way the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) does, but an agency that
protects refugee rights, on both levels, day-to-day legal rights, and
rights in the framework of a durable solution. This is something that
from today people can work on and where they can make a big difference
when it comes to both the current situation of refugees but also in
building stronger support for refugee rights when the scenario arises
where we have political negotiations again.

The second issue where I think a lot of work can be done now is to
really make an effort to engage--and this initiative has to come very
much from the Palestinian side--to engage Israelis, not necessarily on
the level of policy makers and government, but on the level of civil
society institutions and academia, in this debate over conflicting
rights. It is not helpful to keep arguing this black and white scenario:
that either there is a right of return that means over 5 million
Palestinian refugees will flood Israel, or no right of return at all and
the Jewish state has all the right to maintain demographic and property
relations as they are now. Such a black and white scenario is not
helpful.
"
"Isr","Neut","On a winter day in February 2001, a few days after Ehud Barak's defeat
in the special elections for prime minister, I met with Yasser Abed
Rabbo, Palestinian minister for culture and information, in the /al
Quds/ editorial offices in Jerusalem's Atarot industrial park. This was
a continuation of a corridor discussion between us during the Taba
negotiations of January that year.

Abed Rabbo was convinced that the primary mistake at the Camp David
summit, where he also participated, was to raise the Jerusalem question
at the beginning of the negotiations, rather than at the end. As for
Taba, he felt that if only we had had a few more weeks, we could have
completed the framework agreement for peace.

We agreed to try and continue the effort that began at Taba--this time
informally, without obligating anyone but ourselves. We wanted to prove
to ourselves that a final agreement was feasible, to prove to the peace
camps on both sides that there is a partner and a plan. Against a
backdrop of despair, lack of faith and growing violence, we believed
that a model permanent agreement could revitalize the Israeli peace camp
(which had not even bothered to participate in the elections a few days
earlier) as well as the somnolent Palestinian peace camp.

We did not think it would take so long. Technical difficulties,
primarily prohibitions on Palestinians entering Israel and Israelis
entering areas A, and political circumstances--Palestinian governmental
crises and Israeli elections--delayed completion of the project.
Important coalitions were built on both sides: economists, intellectuals
and Fatah activists on the Palestinian side, and former security
officials, party representatives from the center and left, intellectuals
and industrialists on the Israeli side.

The Taba discussions lasted seven days. The eighth day lasted three
years. It ended in Jordan on October 12 of this year, with the signing
of a letter to Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey, to which was
attached the agreed version of the draft agreement.

The foundation of our talks was the Clinton Plan
                                               , which was accepted by
both sides, with reservations, in December 2000. Our basic assumption
was that ""god is in the details,"" and that mere agreements in principle
are not persuasive with regard to the capacity to get to the root of
solutions. The primary package deal or trade-off was an Israeli
concession regarding Palestinian sovereignty over the Temple Mount/Harem
al Sharif, coupled with a perpetual international presence there, in
return for leaving the determination regarding acceptance of Palestinian
refugees to a sovereign Israeli decision.

We did not dwell on ""narratives"", mutual recriminations and assigning
responsibility for the past. We did not ask one another to forsake
dreams. We sufficed with solutions. All the question marks, all the
historical quarrels, all the United Nations decisions that we wasted
long years interpreting in our different ways--all these are answered,
resolved, and realized in the agreement we reached. It is not an easy
agreement for either side, but never has a better one been achieved. It
is offered to the decision makers on both sides; they can, if they so
desire, integrate it as phase III of the roadmap
                                                , i.e., as the final
status agreement that is to be achieved by 2005.

If there is broad support among both publics for the agreement we
reached, their respective leaderships will not be able to ignore what we
have done. Hence we are initiating a broad information campaign: an
agreement is possible; the ongoing situation of terrorism and
retribution exacts a heavy and unnecessary price from both sides and is
pointless; Israeli-Palestinian peace will bring with it economic
salvation for both peoples; it will ensure that Israel remains a Jewish
and democratic state that does not rule over another people, and will
enable the Palestinians to exercise their right to self determination.

A continuation of Israel's present policy, whereby dialogue is forbidden
until terrorism ends, awards a prize to terrorists who have no interest
in peace. Three years after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon promised
security and peace--and gave us less peace and less security--the time
has come to try a different way: the Geneva Accord
                                               offers the only practical
alternative.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: Why did you decide to embark on these negotiations?

A: After the Taba negotiations, we were very close to
reaching an agreement, but the change in the Israeli government after
the elections stopped everything. Therefore, we began to think that this
historic progress that we had made in the previous negotiations should
be finalized. We started to examine which issues at Taba had not been
finalized, and whose resolution would allow us to complete final status
negotiations without leaving anything out and without any ambiguity.

This was the understanding between the Israeli side and us. However, as
time passed, other priorities evolved. The Israeli representatives and
their political tendencies that were involved demonstrated that this
process was special in that it broke the embargo that [Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel] Sharon had imposed.

Q: What were the most difficult areas of debate?

A: I cannot specify one issue. The main thing was to find a
balance between the two positions so that what would be introduced to
the two publics would present a win-win situation. This doesn't mean
that all peace aspirations would be met, but that the basic ones would
be met: [essentially], to let Israelis live without any fear or without
intervention, and to enable the Palestinian people to have their
independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital and also to put an
end to anything that could lead to future hostilities.

So, we decided that the Wailing Wall would be under Israeli sovereignty,
the Haram al Sharif would be under Palestinian sovereignty and East
Jerusalem would be divided between the two states, with part of the city
under Palestinian sovereignty with the exception of the Jewish quarter
which would be under Israeli sovereignty, and a special regime
[comprising] international supervision and guaranteeing freedom of worship.

Q: In some aspects, the agreement holds on to ideas that
have proven to fail, such as, for example, the period of time in which
Israel maintains control over borders and crucial passageways. How are
you convinced that Israel will act in good faith?

A: This is not true. The borders will be controlled by
international forces; a small Israeli contingent will be under the
leadership of the international forces. For a very limited period of
time, the Israelis will remain on the Palestinian borders, but the
border is solely under Palestinian sovereignty and responsibility is
solely international for all the borders with Israel, Egypt and Jordan.
The passageway [between Gaza and the West Bank] will be Israeli, under
the control of the Palestinians. Palestinian police will patrol this
passage and it will be open 24 hours, seven days a week and twelve
months a year.

Q: Did you and Yossi Beilin discuss requiring an official
Israeli apology or acknowledgement of the refugee problem?

A: We tried hard to solve this problem and the compromise we
reached was to commemorate and respect the 1948 locations [the sites of
former Palestinian villages]. This is quite clear in the agreement. I
cannot say that they were ready to accept all of our demands in this
direction.

Q: Has the United States administration responded to the
accord?

A: We are in contact with the Americans. They responded in
the beginning that they welcome an initiative that will lead to peace.
Now we are in the process of explaining to them that this [document] is
not a substitute for the roadmap; on the contrary, it enhances the
roadmap because it fills the hole left in the roadmap concerning a just,
comprehensive solution.

Q: There are those on the Palestinian side who are
dismissing this agreement because it comes at a time when the Israeli
government is not ideologically predisposed to accept it. Is the
agreement just a PR exercise?

A: I think it is not only a public relations exercise--it is
a very direct political message to both publics that there is a possible
leadership and there is a possible solution at a time when extremists
are trying to justify the continuation of this war, saying that there
are no partners and there is no solution.

Notice that the main attack (besides that of Ariel Sharon) against the
agreement came from [former Prime Minister Ehud] Barak. This at least
embarrasses--if not completely crushes--his claims that he was generous
at Camp David and that the Palestinians rejected his offer. It shows
that they didn't offer the minimum of what was required at Camp David,
that [the talks] were intentionally ambiguous and that he collaborated
with Sharon to give him political cover for his campaign against the
Palestinian people, claiming that there was no Palestinian partner.

Now there is a solution /and/ a partnership and that is why Barak and
Sharon are attacking this agreement and trying to undermine the bid
between the Israeli peace camp and us to move our nations towards a
solution and away from this daily destruction.
"
"Isr","Neut","In looking for the immediate causes of the present conflict between
Israel and the Palestinians, we might point to the failure of the Camp
David talks. This was to a large degree the responsibility of Israel,
specifically Ehud Barak, primarily because of his insistence upon
forcing a summit for which the Palestinians had clearly declared
themselves both opposed and unprepared. However well-intended and
far-reaching the proposals offered by Barak (and they were indeed
well-intended and far-reaching in my opinion), they fell significantly
short of the Palestinian need for full sovereignty over the contiguous
territory of the West Bank (and Gaza).

What followed the disappointment of Camp David was the ill-advised visit
to the Temple Mount by Ariel Sharon that triggered the Aqsa intifada.
(Ironically, it was also an incident at the Western Wall that triggered
the bloody clashes between Palestinians and Jews in 1929.)

While the Camp David failure was a contributing factor to the outburst
of Palestinian violence at the end of September 2000, and the Sharon
incident acted as a trigger, the underlying reasons were connected with
the deep disillusionment and disappointment with the Oslo process and
the collapse of the peace process in the years if not months following
the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.

The peace process might have survived if Israel had not assassinated the
""engineer"" Yihya Ayash or if Arafat had cracked down on Hamas and
Islamic Jihad, thereby preventing the terrorist attacks of early 1996.
Similarly, the peace process might have weathered the terrorist attacks
of early 1996 if Rabin, the authoritative security figure for Israelis,
had lived. Shimon Peres did not have such authority; the result was the
election of Netanyahu and the virtual suspension of the peace process.

Yet more fundamentally, the Oslo accords, including the Wye Agreements,
had not been sufficiently implemented--both sides had failed to live up
to their commitments. The situation for Israelis did actually improve
enormously as a result of Oslo: note the doubling of countries with
which Israel held diplomatic relations; tourism to and even from various
Arab countries; an economic boom from investment, tourism growth and
some regional cooperation, and more. For the Palestinians, however, the
situation on the ground actually deteriorated: ironically, as Israel
withdrew from some areas, many more roadblocks and checkpoints were
created, East Jerusalem was virtually closed off and, still more
ominously, more land was lost to settlement expansion as Israel appeared
to be entrenching itself more rather than less solidly into many parts
of the occupied territories. These are the factors that led to
Palestinian disappointment with the peace process.

It was most likely this deep popular disillusionment, coupled possibly
with political considerations that a show of force might produce greater
flexibility on Israel's part that led to the launching of the intifada.
It may have been the case, as some have contended, that the riots of
late September and early October 2000 were planned to be basically
popular and relatively short, much like the Palestinian response to the
opening of the Hasmonean tunnel in 1996, rather than a full-scale return
to ""armed struggle."" It may have been the case that the Palestinian
leadership or those pressing for the intifada did not anticipate the
strong Israeli military response. Whatever the intentions or the
expectations, however, it was this intifada, or perhaps the failure to
call it to a halt while such a move was still possible, that led to the
destructive and tragic conflict of the past four years. The armed
intifada was a mistake--tactically and still more unfortunately,
strategically.

It was a mistake because without the intifada, the continued
negotiations actually begun after Camp David might well have led to an
agreement after all. This will remain an unknown, for the Clinton
bridging proposals and Taba talks both came too late--against the
backdrop of the violence and the certainty that the Israeli negotiating
partner would not be in office much longer. The major destructive
result, however, was the election of Sharon.

But worse still was the unprecedented (for Israel) degree of terrorism
thrust upon the Israeli public in the course of the intifada, confirming
if not actually creating a very real and deep-seated belief on the part
of Israelis that ""there is no partner"". While the Likud had long
proclaimed such a situation, and the failure of Camp David appeared to
confirm it, the terror Israelis experienced particularly between
2000-2003 cannot be underestimated as perceived evidence (even in the
eyes of many on the left) that the Palestinians were not willing to live
in peace with Israel. A Palestinian demand for the right of return,
frequently referred to in Israeli propaganda if not in Palestinian
statements, merely concretized the skepticism created by the terror.

And skepticism has given birth to unilateralism. Unilateral withdrawal
of the settlers and the IDF from Gaza is not a bad thing, but
unilateralism cannot bring about a total end to the occupation and
peace, certainly not when it comes to the West Bank, Jerusalem and all
the issues involved. Only an agreed settlement can do that. The
intifada, and Israel's excessive use of force in response, have made it
more difficult yet even more necessary for each side, once again, to
prove to the other side that it is a partner for peace.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: Who started the intifada?

A: However you wish to twist and turn it, the fact that there is
an Israeli occupation of Palestinian land is sufficient to understand
why there is violence between Palestinians and Israelis. The Israeli
occupation has become more and more entrenched in the Palestinian
territories and a variety of atrocities have been committed against
Palestinians. Thousands of Palestinians have been imprisoned;
Palestinian infrastructure, whether official or private, has been
destroyed; over the years tens of thousands of Palestinians have been
killed; and even more have been injured.

During the seven years of the Oslo process there were two conflicting
tendencies within Palestinian society. On the one hand, Palestinians
were thirsty for some peace and calm and for getting the occupation off
their backs. On the other hand, people witnessed that even during times
of negotiations, settlement building continued, indeed skyrocketed;
Palestinian land continued to be confiscated; checkpoints, meant to
hamper Palestinian lives and livelihoods, were erected; and the measures
of successive Israeli governments only tightened the noose further
around the necks of Palestinians economically, socially and
psychologically.

Given these tendencies, Palestinians were hoping that the Camp David
talks in July 2000 would resolve the conflict once and for all. In their
minds, the late President Yasser Arafat, the symbol of the Palestinian
struggle, went to Camp David with a genuine desire to resolve the
conflict with Ehud Barak and in the presence of Bill Clinton. However,
both the American administration and the Israeli government were
tenacious in their attempts to impose a variety of pressures and
conditions on the Palestinian leadership. Arafat did not yield.

Q: So the failure of Camp David was the principal catalyst?

Following the failure and the collapse of the talks there was a
transitional period of sorts in Palestinian society. That transitional
phase was characterized by a rise in the degree of accumulated
frustration in the Palestinian psyche vis-a-vis the practices of the
Israeli occupation. That is, Palestinians felt and saw Camp David as
evidence that the Israelis were not interested in a settlement to the
conflict based on negotiations.

It was in this tense atmosphere that Sharon, with his violation of the
sanctity of the Aqsa Mosque on September 28, 2000, became the straw that
broke the camel's back. Palestinians felt there was no other way to
react--negotiations had failed, the occupation continued unabated as did
Israeli assaults on Palestinian land and holy places--than to take to
the streets. The outbreak of the Aqsa intifada is a byproduct of years
of failed negotiations and accumulating frustrations within Palestinian
society due to the ongoing atrocities and brutalities by the Israeli
occupation under cover of the peace process. It was, if you will, an
almost inevitable outcome given the fact that the political process did
not work, and the Israeli occupation showed no signs of ending.

Q: There is a suggestion that perhaps the demonstrations
could have been reigned in early in time for the Clinton proposals and
the Taba negotiations.

A: At the start of the intifada, two schools of thought evolved.
The first saw the intifada as a tool for moving negotiations forward.
Certainly, among Israelis, Barak saw the intifada in this context. He
looked back to what happened during Netanyahu's time when the tunnel
upheavals only signified a pause. Barak perhaps calculated that after
some violence, the Palestinians would come back to the negotiating table
and everything would return to normal in time for the Israeli elections.
Clinton certainly wanted developments to go that way, in his quest to go
down in history as the peacemaker between Israelis and Palestinians.
Some Palestinians also adopted these views and looked at the intifada as
only a means to move the political process forward.

The second school of thought, however, really viewed the intifada as a
process of national liberation to end the occupation. For the first few
months, at least six months, Palestinians were concentrating their
efforts on peaceful resistance to the occupation, in a replica of the
first intifada. However, the ferocity of the Israeli response, the
killing of so many Palestinians, not only in the West Bank, Jerusalem
and the Gaza Strip, but also within the 1948 areas, was a signal to
Palestinians that perhaps some fundamental and profound changes would
have to be made in the way the occupation should be resisted. Therefore
there was a gradual progression in the means and tools utilized.

In the longer view it was like this: first there were negotiations
followed by stone throwing protests. These didn't work, indeed, only
more and more Palestinians were killed. Had the Israeli occupation dealt
with these demonstrations in a ""civilized"" way--as civilized as is
possible for a belligerent military occupying power--Palestinians would
have continued to rely on such means. But the Israeli presence in
occupied territory had changed in nature and policy, and having to seek
out checkpoints and go to them was very costly in terms of lives. So we
saw a gradual progression from random shootings at settlements, to
bombings, to suicide bombings, to homemade rockets and, more recently,
the tunnel attacks. Such a progression, I believe, was really
unavoidable. And, resorting to a military resistance, even with the
modest means available to them, Palestinians have compensated the gross
inequity in the military balance of power with a strategic balance of
terror.

Q: How important is resolving the debate over who started
the intifada?

A: It is important for academic reasons, of course, but, quite
frankly, any observer who follows the conflict is bound to realize that
given the fact that there is occupation and the resulting brutal
atrocities against Palestinians, it is only natural that there are
intifadas, that there is violence, and that there are acts of violence.
The occupation is the incubator of violence. The only way out is to work
diligently to end the occupation. This is not only useful for
Palestinians, it is useful for Israelis, because it will rid them of
this inhuman stigma that has attached itself to their institutions. It
will also be good for humanity at large, because in the 21st century to
have a military occupation by one people over another people is a most
barbaric and backward way of conducting your affairs.
"
"Isr","Neut","The government of Israel decided several weeks ago that Palestinian
leader Yasir Arafat ""is no longer relevant"" from its standpoint. This
statement had largely declarative value: on the one hand it expressed
the Israeli public's deep disappointment with Arafat; on the other, it
served as an additional instrument of pressure to persuade Arafat to
recognize that he will not profit from the violence and terrorism that
he initiated in late September 2000.

During the years 1994-2000 the Israeli public pinned its hopes on a
peace process that would ""end the conflict"" and usher in security and
economic prosperity. While it was disappointed with the ongoing
Palestinian violence that accompanied the process, it generally accepted
Arafat's explanation that he was not responsible for the terrorist
attacks, and that he would do all in his power to prevent them. It
acknowledged the distinction Arafat presented to the world between ""good
Palestinians""--supporters of the peace process led by the chairman
himself--and ""bad Palestinians,"" the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas and
Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Throughout the Oslo process this division
enabled Arafat repeatedly to plead his innocence concerning terrorist
attacks. He demanded that Israel make concessions that would ostensibly
strengthen his standing among the Palestinian public vis-a-vis his
violent, refusalist opposition.

Following Arafat's rejection of Israel's far-reaching proposals at Camp
David in July 2000 (which included the establishment of a Palestinian
state on 97 percent of the territory and the division of Jerusalem into
two capital cities), even the most moderate Israelis understood that he
was not moving toward a political solution to the conflict. Their
disappointment grew yet further when it emerged that he had not only
elected to abandon the negotiating table, but that upon his return to
the Palestinian Authority he directed the terrorist organizations and
his own units to launch a wave of terrorism against Israel.

In fact, this directive constituted a direct continuation of Arafat's
policy since establishment of the PA. Arafat believes terrorism serves
his objectives. Accordingly, upon signing the Oslo accords he adopted a
strategy of maintaining a terrorist potential for the achievement of
political goals. At times, when he assessed that terrorism would
genuinely damage immediate Palestinian interests, Arafat invoked a
policy of ""threats and persuasion"" to prevent attacks against Israel. On
these occasions he informed the Islamic fundamentalist organizations
that the costs attached to such attacks outweighed the benefits; hence
he directed them to avoid such attacks for the time being. To ensure he
was understood, Arafat used the code phrase ""damage to the Palestinian
national interest."" When these efforts proved unsuccessful, he relied on
arrests and local violent clashes to enforce his message.

But even at its height, Arafat's counterterrorism campaign focused only
on restraining the terrorist organizations' motivation to attack Israel.
He never acted to eliminate their violent capabilities. He never
destroyed their explosives laboratories, never arrested, tried and
jailed terrorists for extended periods, never destroyed illegal weaponry
and never began educating his people to seek peace and to accept the
existence of Israel as a sovereign Jewish state. Instead, he elected to
ignore the terrorist organizations' military expansion and to violate
his contractual commitments to Israel to prevent terrorism. He continued
to incite his people against Israel through the PA media, school texts
and any other available means. From Israel's standpoint this meant that
even during periods of relative quiet, it was sitting on a powder keg.

Arafat's policy since 1994 testifies like a thousand witnesses that he
has opted for a strategy of non-acceptance of Israel's existence. One
expression of this strategy is his repeated declarations that, while
ostensibly he does not seek Israel's destruction, he can't be prevented
from dreaming about such a goal.

Thus it is perfectly legitimate for Israel to query Arafat's relevancy.
Not only did Arafat not fulfill his promise to provide peace and
security to Israel in return for its painful concessions--he himself has
emerged as the prime terrorist.

Today the Israeli public discussion centers on the question whether
Arafat is at all capable of stopping the terrorism.

A negative response to this question means that Arafat has indeed ceased
to be relevant from Israel's standpoint. Israel must wait until, sooner
or later, there emerges an alternative Palestinian leader or coalition
capable of leading the Palestinian people to a resolution of the
conflict by stopping the violence and destroying the military
infrastructure of the terrorist organizations.

A positive response to the question of Arafat's capacity to stop
terrorism leads to the conclusion that he has deliberately elected not
to exercise this capability. Here, anyone who still believes that
additional Israeli concessions, territorial or otherwise, made under the
pressure of terrorist attacks, will cause Arafat to adopt a policy of
peace and to strike at the terrorist infrastructure, is mistaken and
misleading. Further concessions will merely reinforce Arafat's belief
that violence pays.

The only way to try to force Arafat to make a strategic choice for
peace, is to apply ongoing pressure: Israeli, American, European and
Arab. Pressure that will force him to abandon his strategy of terrorism
and opt for non-violent means to resolve the conflict. The enlightened
world must raise the cost for Arafat of Palestinian terrorism to a point
where it no longer pays him to initiate and tolerate it.

In conclusion, Israel must bide its time until one of two developments
takes place: either Arafat's strategy changes, or the Palestinian
leadership changes.
"
"Pal","Neut","In the second half of June 1982, the Israeli army completed its siege
around Palestinian forces in West Beirut. It tightened the noose on the
Palestinian leadership, cutting water and electricity and phone lines in
the town. At that time, then-Israeli defense minister Ariel Sharon
unveiled additional previously undeclared aims to the war. He ordered
his troops to intensify air raids and artillery shelling in
neighborhoods where the Palestinian leadership was residing.

He called on Arafat to throw down his arms and declare surrender. ""The
assault will not end until the PLO and its leadership is liquidated and
its presence eliminated from all of Lebanon."" He even tried to extract a
decision from his government to enter West Beirut where Arafat was
staying and take him off to prison in a fishnet dropped from a
helicopter (that crazy idea was not approved).

At the time, Arafat refused to submit to Sharon's conditions and
extortionate demands. He held strong to his positions and ridiculed
Sharon's offer to allow him to leave Beirut in a Red Cross uniform. The
Palestinians held steadfast under Arafat's command alongside nationalist
Lebanese for three months. Afterwards, they were to leave freely, fully
armed and with dignity.

At the Beirut port, a journalist asked Abu Ammar where he was going.
Without hesitating, he answered, ""To Palestine."" At that time, Sharon
was very pleased to see Arafat embark on the departing ship, saying,
""Arafat is finished and history will close the book on him.""

Not long after, Sharon stepped down from the cabinet--defeated. The
opposition had accused him of lying to and misleading the government and
people and engaging Israel in a losing war. The official Kahane
investigative committee found him responsible for not preventing the
massacres of Sabra and Shatilla and suggested that he resign his post as
defense minister.

And so Sharon's loathing of Arafat only grew. He held him responsible
for his piteous outcome (one he brought upon himself) and for depriving
him of a hero's medal for his war against the PLO. He nurtured this
hostility towards Arafat and held out for his revenge.

Almost 12 years after this event, Israelis finally acknowledged the
failure of a military solution to the conflict with the Palestinians. In
1994, Abu Ammar returned to Palestine along with thousands of cadres and
fighters who had accompanied him in his exit from Beirut. Here he set up
the first Palestinian Authority on the ground with a strong army of more
than 30,000 armed men. Meanwhile, the Israeli army was still suffering
in South Lebanon as a result of the dilemma that Sharon put them in.

In 1996, Sharon took over the post of foreign minister in Benjamin
Netanyahu's government. He prided himself on refusing to receive Arafat.
He refused, in the presence of United States President Bill Clinton, to
shake hands with Arafat at the Wye River negotiations. He then boasted
of his actions, despite that they went against all diplomatic protocol
and the basics of an aspired-for peace. To everyone else, he looked as
if he suffered from a psychological complex--the ""Arafat nightmare.""
Arafat was sure that no Palestinian-Israeli agreement and peaceful
relationship that developed would strip Sharon's heart and mind of
hatred for the Palestinian leader.

After Sharon won the elections in 2001, he could no longer hide his
buried. Less than a week after his government was formed, Sharon
announced that he would not meet Arafat and accused him of a list of
charges, the smallest of which was that Arafat was a ""liar"" and
""terrorist.""

Sharon awaited his revenge and Arafat took up the challenge. Despite his
continuous statements avowing respect for the selection of the Israeli
people, Abu Ammar was fully aware that Sharon was bent on settling his
personal and political accounts and that a clash was inevitable.

With the terrorist attacks on Washington and New York on September 11
and the military operations carried out by Palestinians against civilian
targets in Israel, Sharon found the perfect opportunity to both carry
out revenge against Arafat and destroy any remaining bridges of peace
between Palestinians and Israelis. He escalated his war against Arafat
and the Authority, comparing him to Osama bin Laden and the Palestinian
Authority to the Taliban. He then ordered his army to encircle Arafat's
personal headquarters in Ramallah.

Now the Israeli army stands only tens of meters away from the
Palestinian leader, even though Sharon knows very well that political
accounts cannot be measured as such. Besieging Arafat has only
strengthened the Palestinian among his people, putting him on the same
level as ordinary citizens who have been under siege for months.

I don't know if Sharon has secretly visited the Israeli military post
overlooking Arafat's office, just to pleasure in the scene. But
Palestinians here and abroad have heard and seen him daily on TV
speaking sadistically of ""jailing"" Arafat in Ramallah. During his coming
trip to Washington, Sharon will likely try to press the American
administration to finish what he failed to achieve in Beirut, with
little regard for the consequences of his actions and words on the
future of the two peoples.

While certainly the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has complicated
political dimensions that did not originate during Sharon's reign,
Sharon's behavior over this last year of power has ""personalized"" the
conflict. Sharon's attempts to veil this animosity in ""security needs""
have failed and anyone taking a close look at the Sharon governments'
description of Arafat as ""irrelevant"" would easily see through the mask.

But it is said that lies have a short life. The results of this new
round of conflict between Sharon and Arafat will prove that the lifespan
of personal vendettas is equally short. Yes, Sharon has besieged Arafat
in a tight corner of Ramallah. But those who can see the other side of
the coin see Arafat besieging Arab and world leaders. In the Israeli
street and in several world capitals, it is Arafat who has surrounded
Sharon, forthrightly accusing him of failing at peace.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: What is the objective of establishing a Jewish
neighborhood at Ras al-Amud, in the heart of Arab Jerusalem?

A: The central objective is to create Jewish contiguity between
different areas.

Q: But in fact isn't this an attempt to break Palestinian
contiguity, between the Temple Mount and the eastern outskirts of the city?

A: In advancing Jewish settlement in Jerusalem we are acting in
accordance with three guiding principles: linkage, which we mentioned a
moment ago; division, which you just asked about; and void, meaning
filling an area where there is nothing.

Q: Why do you think the introduction of permanent Jewish
residents to Ras al-Amud was accepted with relative tranquility?

A: This is a general question about Jerusalem--why has it been
relatively so quiet? I believe that because a large portion of the Arab
residents receives services from the municipality, they know what they
could lose. Everyone makes their own calculation. But I'm not
knowledgeable enough about this issue; I'm not certain this is the main
answer.

Q: What is your overall strategy concerning some 230,000
Jerusalem Arabs?

A: I would offer them full Israeli citizenship. I would not allow
them to take up citizenship of a Palestinian state, at least not at this
stage. As things stand, they should be our citizens, even though this
creates quite a few problems. We must endeavor to ensure that they
[Jerusalem Palestinians] do not become a magnet for the Arabs of Judea
and Samaria, because of the social services, and don't draw them into
Jerusalem, for example the Hebron Arabs who have moved to the outskirts
of Jerusalem.

Q: But most of the Jerusalem Arabs have refused Israeli
citizenship.

A: I'll leave the questions regarding their behavior to experts
like yourselves. I barely understand the behavior of the Jews.

Q: And how do you view the Jerusalem question within the
framework of a final status agreement with the Palestinians?

A: It's difficult to detach Jerusalem from the broader issue. We
should not alter the present borders of Jerusalem. We can discuss border
alterations that favor the Palestinians, but only at a moment of
strength in the negotiations, from a position of sovereignty. Today
every concession is understood as a prelude to the next concession.

Q: And the Temple Mount/Harem a-Sharif in final status?

A: The Temple Mount should be under Israeli rule. This is the most
holy site of the Jewish people. Sovereignty is determined by the very
fact that we are Jews. The Mount was taken from us by force, and I don't
reject retaking it by force, or perhaps through political negotiations.
The current situation is unbearable, when only Jews cannot ascend the
Mount.

The primary attention of the Israeli authorities should focus on the
Temple Mount. The task of Ras al-Amud is to guard the Temple Mount.

Q: How do you view the ""mosaic"" map of former president
Bill Clinton and former prime minister Ehud Barak, according to which
wherever Jews live in Jerusalem will fall under Israeli sovereignty, and
where Arabs live will be Palestinian?

A: This is not a plan. We said it then, when it was presented, and
today, sadly, we say ""we told you so"". There is no logic here. We have
seen where this leads us. We're still liable to get into this plan again
via the roadmap, which is a worse version of Oslo--through the back
door, by talking about freezing settlement activity and establishing a
provisional Palestinian state.

Q: Finally, can you address the security fence that is
going up around the city? The fence separates parts of the city in some
places. What are the ramifications for the future borders of Jerusalem?

A: This is the politicians' fence of folly. Behind closed doors
they all say there was no need to build it--they gave in to public
opinion. The army serves as the contractor and says ""this is the
politicians' affair"". The money could have been used for more serious
security objectives. This is one of the bigger scandals of recent times.
Of course it will have ramifications: it could partially determine the
border of Jerusalem, just like the border of the rest of Israel.
"
"Pal","Neut","The status of Jerusalem was disputed between the Zionist movement and
the Palestinian Arabs even before Israel came to be. Then, Jewish
settlements in Jerusalem tended to fall largely to the west and north of
the city, although in the western neighborhoods, Jews and Arabs were
gradually mixing. But despite this growing presence, the 1947 United
Nations Partition Plan did not give Jerusalem to either Jews or Arabs.
(This was not a matter of dispute for Zionist leaders who, unlike the
Arabs, officially accepted the plan. David Ben Gurion was reportedly
planning a capital somewhere in the Negev.)

But in 1948, at a time when certain forces on both sides seemed to
tacitly agree on implementing the Partition Plan through war, Jerusalem
was the site of bitter fighting. From the Zionist perspective, the
battle over the city was intended to secure a connection between the
Jewish settlements in and around Jerusalem and the rest of the Jewish
communities in the new Jewish state. The Zionists fought very hard to
take the key Latroun junction and after the war was over, the Israeli
government expelled the Palestinian residents of Lod and Ramla in July
1948. Left as they were, those towns would have been a fork disrupting
Jewish continuity between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Even before the war there had been several Zionist campaigns intended to
drive villagers from the areas neighboring Jerusalem. The impetus was on
one hand to create Jewish continuity and secure the road to Jerusalem,
and on the other to push the Arabs to the east into Transjordanian-held
territories or what would have been the Arab state. In April 1948, there
were also similar campaigns in the western Arab neighborhoods of
Jerusalem. As a result of this slow dispossession, by mid-1949 following
the Transjordan-Israel armistice agreement, the area of Jerusalem
falling inside Israel's boundaries was almost entirely Jewish-composed.
There were some Arab villages that remained on the periphery of the
Israeli-occupied Jerusalem and along the borders of Jordanian-held
territories, but only one or two villages survived between Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem.

Historically then, Israel's policy has been to cleanse the land of Arab
presence. If Palestinians must remain, they are to be cut off or hidden
so that the average Israeli or European visitor does not notice them and
gets the feeling that all of this land is and always has been Israeli.

A similar logic seems to have been in the mind of Israelis after the
1967 War. We cannot say for sure that Israel wanted to keep all of the
territories occupied in 1967, but it was clear one day after the war
ended that Israel was planning to keep all of Jerusalem under its
control. Israel's very first act was to cleanse the ""Jewish Quarter"" of
Jerusalem from its Palestinian Arab residents. The Arabs were kicked out
of the quarter and many of them moved north towards Ramallah, to what is
now the topsy-turvy border neighborhood of Al Ram. Israel then
demolished the Maghribi Quarter just in front of the Western Wall. It
also established Jerusalem's settlement activities with the building of
the settlement on the French Hill that would connect with Mount Scopus
to the east, an island of Jewish control, as well as the settlement of
Neve Yacov. In a sense, the goal of severing Jerusalem from its
Palestinian environs and connecting it with the Jewish communities
within Israel, the very same goal that motivated the 1948 attacks on the
villages west of Jerusalem, was being implemented.

That marked the beginnings of the creation of a ""ring"" around Jerusalem.
In time, that ring would allow the insertion of more than 200,000
Israeli Jews into occupied Arab Jerusalem. The process was easier on
Jerusalem's Bethlehem flank because there already were Israeli
settlements in Bakaa and Talpiot and the only connection between
Bethlehem and Jerusalem Arabs were a few mixed villages like Sur Baher.
The forested hill of Jabal Abu Gneim lay in this area, and now the
once-controversial settlement of Har Homa has been constructed to block
Arab access to that.

On the other side of the city, Maale Adumim lies in the middle of
nowhere, with a Palestinian population between it and Jerusalem's Jewish
presence. That Palestinian population, through Jericho, is still able to
interact with Palestinians in the West Bank, but not--it appears--for
long. Gradually, Israel is closing this gap.

Now, with the escalation of violence and closure policies in the last
two years, Israel has found an opportune time to completely seal eastern
Jerusalem. While Jerusalem has been ""closed"" in the sense that West
Bankers and Gazans are not allowed to travel there without Israeli
permission, now there is the opportunity to physically encircle the city
with walls. These walls, purportedly to keep the Palestinian West Bank
population out of the city and besiege Ramallah, Bethlehem, and Abu Dis,
will more importantly completely strangle Arab East Jerusalem. Indeed,
the only remaining weak point in this circle is that Palestinians are
still able to exit the Old City through its Palestinian-inhabited areas
and Ras al-Amud, heading on to Jericho and deeper into the West Bank.

Enter right wing Zionist Irving Moskowitz. More of Moskowitz's millions
made off of the elderly in Florida bingo halls will go to settling the
Palestinian village of Ras al-Amud with Jews. Now that negotiations are
about to restart (or so we hear), the current Israeli government is
doing all it can to excise any final physical connection between
Jerusalem and Palestinians who see the city as their geographical,
spiritual and economic heart.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: How do you understand Egypt's motives and objectives in
launching its Gaza initiative?

A: There are three reasons for the Egyptians' involvement in the
Gaza Strip. First is their understanding that they cannot claim to be a
leader of the Arab world without doing anything. If they want to be
engaged, they have to contribute more than their limited contribution
until now. Second, they understand that their position with the United
States is somehow connected to a positive image regarding the process.
And third, they understand that chaos in Gaza might somehow influence
the street in Cairo. I think the strongest element is the first and not
the third. At the end of the day the influence of Palestinian chaos is
minimal in Cairo.

Q: What will constitute the success of this project?

A: [The idea is to] give the Egyptians the chance to teach the
Palestinians how to organize themselves and help them be really
determined to fight terrorism--which is the main problem of the
Palestinians--and to do it without erosion of Israel's ability to fight
terrorism. There is no question that if the Egyptians can convince the
terrorist organizations to be more constructive after the unilateral
retreat and to begin to build their own society instead of promoting
terrorism, this is very positive from our point of view. If the
Egyptians can convince [Palestinian leader Yasser] Arafat to give up his
control over the security establishment and build a real force that will
deal with the terrorists, criminals and corruption inside Gaza--three
closely connected elements--this will be helpful for us. If they can
stop the smuggling of munitions from Egypt into Gaza, it would be very
important for reducing the level of terrorism coming from Gaza and would
benefit both Israel and the Palestinians.

Q: Are you optimistic that Egypt will succeed in these
endeavors?

A: The problem is that I'm not sure the Egyptians are ready to
pay the price, meaning to be involved in friction with Hamas and the
other terrorist organizations. And I'm not sure Arafat is ready to
implement what is being asked of him. At the end of the day we might
find ourselves in a worse situation, in which we commit ourselves not to
act against terrorism inside Gaza and at the same time nothing is done
by the Egyptians.

Q: How do you understand Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon's motives for inviting in the Egyptians?

A: Sharon understands that he's taking a huge risk for the
security of Israel by the unilateral retreat, and he wants to share
responsibility for the results with another Arab country. He would like
to believe that this time the Egyptians will act totally differently
from the way they acted up until now. We have to remember that they have
the sovereignty and control over the entrances to the tunnels used to
smuggle weapons into Gaza in recent years.

Q: So is Sharon adopting a radical new strategy toward Egypt?

A: I hope those Israelis who negotiate with the Egyptians don't
make a huge mistake by giving up one of the main achievements of the
political peace agreement with the Egyptians and allowing the Egyptians
to help the Palestinians with military forces. What the Palestinians
need is domestic security organization, not military forces.

Q: Let's assume Egypt succeeds in Gaza. How does this
affect the West Bank?

A: The West Bank is totally different strategically. I don't
think we can copy the Egyptian experience in Gaza into Judea and
Samaria. But after a few years of Egyptian peace in Gaza, we might learn
some lessons [regarding the West Bank].

Q: Back to Gaza: are you optimistic about the chances for
Egyptian success?

A: No, I'm skeptical about the Egyptians. In our experience with
them, they begin with high profile promises of a rosy future, and at the
end the implementation is very poor and the results are doubtful.

For example, for many years they promised to stop the smuggling of
weapons into the Gaza Strip but did not. Remember the Karine A
[Palestinian arms smuggling ship]? Its target was Alexandria. From my
personal experience, I can tell you that we tried to organize a visit by
our National Defense College to Egypt and couldn't succeed, nor could we
organize a reciprocal visit by them.

Q: To sum up, if Egypt does its part, are you in favor of
disengagement from Gaza?

A: At the end of the day, none of the real problems will be
solved by unilateral withdrawal, while the security risk Israel is
taking is so high that it is a mistake. But we live in a democracy: as
the decision is approved by the government and the Knesset, we should
minimize the risks and optimize the advantages that some people believe
might come out of it.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: The Egyptian initiative was apparently needed because a
direct bilateral agreement on withdrawal between Israel and the
Palestinians was impossible. Why is that?

A: The Israelis are heading toward consolidating the occupation
in the West Bank through the separation fence, settlement expansion, and
all kinds of oppression against the Palestinians. We think that this
disengagement plan is using the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, planned
for March 2005, to impose a kind of engagement in the West Bank through
the separation wall. A one-sided solution is being imposed on the
Palestinians.

Q: What do you think of the Egyptian initiative?

A: The Egyptians themselves say they don't have an initiative,
but they are trying to take advantage of the opportunity presented by
Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. They would like to help the
Palestinians to get control over the areas in the Gaza Strip from which
the Israelis are going to withdraw.

The Egyptians say they do not wish to market the disengagement plan. The
difference between the disengagement plan and withdrawal is that the
disengagement plan includes expansion in the West Bank, while the
Egyptians aim to help the Palestinians with the withdrawal from the Gaza
Strip. Nobody wants the Gaza Strip, perhaps not even the Palestinians,
so Israel is seeking to bargain Gaza for the West Bank.

The Palestinian leadership rejects this approach, even though everybody
in the world--especially the Israelis and Americans--says the
disengagement plan is the first step in implementing the roadmap. We
think that on the contrary, it is not a step toward implementing the
roadmap; it is an alternative step.

Q: Why do some Fatah members oppose the Egyptian initiative?

A: They have certain fears about the future Egyptian role in the
Gaza Strip. They think maybe the Egyptians want to play a security role
in the Gaza Strip. Also there are certain Arabs who oppose the Egyptian
initiative, like the Syrians. Last week, about ten Palestinian
organizations in Damascus issued a declaration against the Egyptian
initiative. Hamas and Islamic Jihad are opposed, because--I think--they
are concerned that the Egyptians are trying to consolidate the role of
the Palestinian National Authority, so this does not fit with their
interests.

Q: How likely is it that the PNA and non-PNA factions like
Hamas and Islamic Jihad will be able to agree on withdrawal terms?

A: They don't now. They have opposite positions. The PNA supports
the Egyptian plan.

Q: Do they all have to agree in order for the initiative to
succeed?

A: Hamas and Jihad could sabotage the plan, using different
means, like military attacks. On the other hand, there is an opportunity
to achieve agreement through the internal Palestinian dialogue. We think
that there should be concurrence, but now there is not.
"
"Isr","Neut","Camp David, which followed intensive preparatory negotiations in Sweden,
was for Israel an important benchmark in the process, rather than a
final conclusion of it. It aimed at bringing about an end to the
occupation, and, it was hoped, an end to the conflict.

The Palestinians' approach to the summit stemmed from a search for
historic justice. In addition, it entailed exploiting political
negotiations as a phase in the ongoing clash of cultures, religions and
peoples.

There was thus a significant gap in the way both parties conceived of
the purpose of the summit. This conceptual gap affected the unfolding of
events far more than any of the mistakes made by either of the parties
or the mistrust that characterized their relationship along the way.

At Camp David, it was Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat who critically
failed. This is my view, indeed, but I also believe that the bulk of
Palestinian society understands it now as well: the tragedy that has
befallen them over the past two and a half years has a nametag on it.
The talks in Camp David and pursuant to it could have paved the way
towards ending the occupation, much as the roadmap
                                                 does.

When the dialogue does resume, as we have to believe it will, it is
absolutely vital that we draw the lessons of the collapse of the Camp
David summit. Among numerous such lessons I would suggest the following:

/First, there must be preparation of public opinion./ The ""historic
compromise"" concealed in the agreement almost reached at Camp David was
not well explained to the respective constituencies. In Israel,
commentaries focused on what we were likely to be giving up rather than
the benefits of transformation or the fruits of peace. It seems almost
obvious that concerted effort and attention must be given to continuous,
comprehensive public relations--explaining to the public the thinking
behind the political process.

But this did not happen, or at least not sufficiently. Arafat for his
part never clearly projected a readiness to reach a true historic
compromise with Zionism, based on the partition of the Land of Israel
into two independent political entities. And in the absence of any other
directive from above, the ongoing hostility and wild incitement fell on
fertile ground. To this I would add the need to establish moderate
international and Arab coalitions to sustain United States policy, a
lesson already well learned and implemented by President George W. Bush.

/Second, attention must be paid to both sides' perceptions, not just to
the objective facts./ On the issue of the refugees, for example, it was
the image of things that held sway over the substance. Here was an ethos
that had been built up and nurtured over decades as one of the
cornerstones of the Palestinian national struggle. The Palestinian
negotiators considered it their duty to show that the suffering of the
refugees had come to an end and that their dream was about to be
realized, even if only formally. As a result, for many of our
Palestinian counterparts, the wording of this section in the draft
agreement was far more important than the practical mechanisms to be set
up to help rehabilitate the refugees, or the effort to mobilize the
international community on their behalf.

/Third, careful thought must be given to the question of process
management./ Sometimes it may be as important as the substance and
content of negotiations. When parties move towards closing such a
dramatic ""deal"", the process must be kept very well defined and very
strict. A rigid framework is needed with a rigid agenda from which the
parties cannot be allowed to deviate. This was definitely not the case
at Camp David. Indeed, it started with an orderly procedure of
presenting positions, setting out respective interests and then giving
each of the sides their respective ""assignments"". The facilitator
hosting the summit got off to a good start. However, there was no
follow-up. The mechanism later collapsed, and the business-like,
pragmatic atmosphere that had marked the beginning simply fell away. The
process was unclear and disorganized. I hope that the same pattern does
not repeat itself in the process of pushing President Bush's Middle East
roadmap forward.

/Fourth, the permanent status core issues are all interlinked./ It is
not possible to isolate any single issue from the others. The approach
adopted by the Israeli negotiators was predicated on a readiness to
discuss far-reaching ideas for solving all these issues, as long as
nothing was considered agreed and binding until everything was agreed.
For their part, the Palestinians' suspicion that Israel was seeking a
way to deceive the world and perpetuate the occupation prevailed over
any reasonable explanations to the contrary.

/Fifth, timing is crucial./ The Clinton proposals
                                                of December 2000 were
ready as early as August 2000. They followed up on as many as 50
extensive daily negotiations, recapping the convergences reached in Camp
David between the parties. Had President Clinton presented them then,
capitalizing on the momentum remaining from the summit, I believe the
outcome might have been different. In the event, a very different
momentum of violence was brought into being and the historic opportunity
was lost. Sadly enough, there was no realistic US contingency plan in
place, and no fallback or exit strategies prepared in anticipation of
the summit's failure.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: After a great deal of hindsight, what did the experience
of Camp David teach Palestinians?

A: One can assess and reassess one's accomplishments and
failures, but obviously the Camp David experience failed for a variety
of reasons, including the contributions of the participants--Israelis,
Americans and the Palestinians.

The Americans convened the summit at a time when the negotiations had
not reached a level that would indicate conclusion. In a sense, they
convened the summit without significant preparation and under
duress--particularly from the Israelis, who knew that conditions had not
ripened enough. [Then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud] Barak came with an
attitude of ""take-it-or-leave it"" and a strategy of ill will in the
sense that he did not offer complete and comprehensive support [for the
talks]. At the same time, he was attempting to undermine the interim
phase agreements by arriving at a permanent settlement that included no
further claims by the Palestinians, all the while knowing that the
Israeli position did not meet the minimum of what was required.

Third, the Palestinians went without sufficient preparation and a
coherent strategy. They went as a fragmented team, with many points of
view. They didn't present ideas and so they were in a reactive mode. A
lot can be said about Palestinian negotiating strategy.

Q: Do you think that there are final status issues where,
after Camp David and after the intifada, Palestinians would likely be
less flexible?

A: We cannot talk about being more or less flexible because Camp
David could not have reached an agreement. It was a starting point and
Barak wanted it to be a final point. I don't think that one can blame
the Palestinians--as many people like to do very conveniently--by saying
that this was a ""missed opportunity"", because there was no opportunity
to be missed.

The Palestinians made a very serious mistake in not exposing what
happened in Camp David, in not coming out publicly with their version.
The Israeli version and then the American version became the dominant
description of what happened. These were fraught with many vested
interests and personal agendas. Not until a year later, did the
Palestinian story start coming out.

Q: Why was that?

A: Again, probably a lack of understanding of the significance
of their own narrative, as well as the lack of a cohesive narrative. It
was a very obviously fragmented performance in the midst of a campaign
to discredit the Palestinians.

Q: When you look at the strain of negotiations through the
Madrid and Oslo talks, Camp David and then the roadmap, do you see any
significant shifts in the assumptions on which negotiations are based?

A: You cannot reinvent the substance. Palestinians have always
maintained that what is required is full Israeli withdrawal from the
1967 boundaries and the establishment of an independent and viable state
and an equitable and just solution for the refugees.

It doesn't take much imagination to address the basic issues. These are
the issues that have been on the books since the beginning and have been
addressed obliquely in a variety of ways.

But what has changed is the way that substance is being tackled. In
Madrid, even though there was a two-phase approach that the Americans
adopted (we tried very hard not to have a two-phase approach), there was
real political engagement.

In Oslo, of course, the talks were concluded because some issues were
totally ignored, others were postponed and there were separate
agreements--in a sense, the flaws of the Declaration of Principles
                                            (DOP) allowed it to be
signed. If it had been a serious document, then it would have taken much
more time and it wouldn't have been signed in the dark. It prioritized
the interests of the few at the expense of the public, and we are paying
the price because it allowed Israel to manipulate the DOP to its own end.

After that, Taba and Wye suffered from the basic flaws of the DOP:
Israel was in control. Palestinians were on the defensive and reactive.
There was further fragmentation of the land, further fragmentation of
the people, further phases that were not implemented. Then we ended up
at Camp David, where the basic flaw was that the talks came from the
mentality of occupation. The basis of any agreement should be
international law and legality and an understanding that there are equal
human rights, not Israel in a position of superiority.

The roadmap                                                 , for the
first time, supposedly includes a global commitment. There are no longer
two sponsors, the United States and Russia, but the Quartet [which
includes the United Nations and the European Union].

When the chips were down, however, we ended up with only one sponsor.
The roadmap had genuine third-party participation to provide
verification and accountability, but gradually the monitoring and
verification has become restricted to the Americans only.

The other unique thing about the roadmap is that it defines the
objective of talks as a two-state solution, with Palestine as a viable
sovereign state (even though [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon did
not agree to this formula).

Overall, the problems faced by the Palestinian negotiators, the Israeli
mentality of occupation, and the lack of third-party intervention have
been exhibited throughout the peace process. As such, Camp David
represents only one of those stages.
"
"Isr","Neut","My support for the new road map presented by the United States on behalf
of the Quartet to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is being given to one of
the less creative, more problematic and clumsier documents that the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict has known. I would support any proposal
that returns the two parties to the negotiating table in anticipation of
a permanent status agreement and that puts an end to the nightmare that
the two peoples have been enduring for the past 25 months. But one might
have anticipated that the combined efforts of the United States,
European Union, Russia and the United Nations would produce a more
intelligent document than this patchwork paper with an ambitious title.

Take, for example, the determination that the two sides are asked to
undertake 13 highly important activities between October and December
2002--while American emissary William Burns asks them to present their
comments on the document only in December 2002! People who show no
respect for the document they are presenting can hardly expect the
recipients to respect them. Thus the process must be postponed for two
months, and anyone who recalls what happened to the Mitchell Report and
the Tenet ideas can rest assured that Bush's road map has an even better
chance of receiving the same treatment.

The road map proposes three phases, some of which are divided into
sub-phases, in order to reach a permanent settlement that includes a
Palestinian state in 2005. In the interim the parties implement
confidence-building measures, cease the violence, and cooperate between
them, while the Palestinians carry out reforms, hold elections, appoint
a prime minister and even take official possession for the first time of
the brainchild that has been offered them: a state with provisional
borders that will exist for two years. During this period two
international conferences will be held to encourage the sides in their
difficult tasks.

Anyone reading this plan can justifiably ask themselves why we need a
road map to reach the house next door. All we need to do is return to
the negotiating table, continue the effort made at the Taba talks that
were stopped in January 2001, reach a permanent agreement based on the
Clinton Plan (or the Bush vision) and implement it.

The road map comprises no original proposal that could help us more
easily overcome the bloody cycle of terrorism and retribution. The
notion of prolonging the interim period through 2005 contradicts the
perception of many on the left and the right that the interim period in
effect provided an opportunity to the extremists who sought to torpedo
the process, and that it would be preferable to forego it completely and
move straight into negotiations on a peace agreement. An additional
extension will only enable the opponents of peace to redeploy their forces.

The proposal to establish temporary borders for the Palestinian state is
particularly problematic: here we have a double negotiation--once for an
interim settlement, and again immediately thereafter. I would assess
that the first negotiation will not be any easier than the second, nor
will it facilitate agreement in the second round. We are liable to face
a situation in which, once the temporary borders are fixed, some in
Israel will feel that they have solved the demographic problem, and will
have no incentive to enter negotiations over permanent borders.
Meanwhile, on the Palestinian side frustration and disquiet will grow,
thereby producing renewed violence as a consequence of the loss of trust
between the two parties. For those who seek peace on both sides, the
temporary borders are the biggest landmine buried in this road map.

An international conference is likely to be a festive event that binds
the two parties and enables them to justify breaking the cycle of
violence that they have been swept into. But such a conference is also
liable to be an impediment, due to the disagreements that will
inevitably arise over its composition, its authority and decisions
regarding its content. Two such conferences during three years look good
on paper, but are liable to delay realization of the political process
rather than facilitating it.

Worst of all--both sides have received the new document and have been
asked to present their comments. They are undoubtedly engaged at this
very moment in preparing them. Within two months the Americans will
receive dossiers of reservations, thicker than the plan itself. Each
party will like in the plan what the other party rejects, and at the end
of December we are liable to be in a situation similar to December 2000,
when both sides accepted the Clinton Plan, but through their
reservations transformed their support into negation.

My support for the road map reflects solely the fact that it is
preferable--if accepted--to the existing situation. But whoever wants to
get to the house next door, and believes in their objective, can simply
leave it at home.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: How did United States envoy William Burns present the
roadmap to the Palestinian side?

A: It was done in a meeting outlining elements that the United
States believes are important in order to get on a track of
negotiations. It was not done through any sort of consultative means. In
fact, it was done by telling the Palestinians that this is the vision
that they had. Nonetheless, I was told that [the meeting] was very
positive, but that there are some concerns about the actual roadmap.

Q: Can you talk some about those concerns?

A: The concerns are that we are going down the same path that we
have now been going down for the last two years. The United States has
still not recognized that there is a direct link between Israel's lack
of security and Palestinian freedom. Instead what the United States is
trying to do is to not confront Israel on its settlement policies, not
confront Israel on its 35-year occupation, but pandering to Israel by
reassuring Israel that it can get security without ever giving up land
and the settlements.

Now there is also the question of ""reform"", in other words that
Palestinians must ""humanize"" themselves in order for Israel to finally
end its illegal occupation of Palestinian territory.

Q: What were your consultations with the United States
leading up the presentation of the document?

A: What our submissions repeatedly said was that it is very
important that the United States focus on the link between security and
freedom and not simply aggregate the two issues, as if Palestinians are
somehow genetically pre-disposed to violence and as if the settlements
are somehow organic in nature. Sadly, the United States has not
recognized that link and is instead delaying a settlement freeze--the
very cause for this uprising and end in negotiations--until a later phase.

The other thing that we really pushed for was some sort of monitoring
mechanism. What we saw over the course of the Oslo was that there was no
third party monitoring on the ground. Again, the United States is
hesitant to take on the role.

Q: How do you think that the Palestinian leadership will
respond to the demand for an ""empowered Palestinian prime minister?""

A: I am not sure how they will respond to that specifically, but in
my own personal view it is somewhat misguided. When Palestinians were
saying that they wanted reforms, these two very nations [Israel and the
United States] were the ones saying that they did not want reforms.

What this actually means is that they do not want to deal with the
elected leader [i.e., President Yasser Arafat]. But if they don't want
to deal with the elected leader, then why are they blocking elections to
recreate some sort of dictatorship regime where the prime minister is
imposed, rather than allowing Palestinians to exercise
self-determination and elect their own leader?

Q: Is that your understanding as to why the document calls
for Legislative Council elections and not presidential elections?

A: Precisely. The major call for reforms and elections came this
summer, when we pushed the United States for elections. We were told
that the timing wasn't right. That makes us ask, ""Are you actually
serious about reform or are you interested in a puppet regime that will
pander to the interests of the United States and Israel?""

Q: It seems that President Arafat is making some efforts to
move ahead in this vein, but are there attempts being made to change the
roadmap?

A: We submitted our own remarks on the roadmap at that last meeting
and we are going to continue to try to highlight to the US
administration that certain elements of it should be changed, otherwise
it will be an unworkable and untenable plan. I just heard today that
[Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon has accepted the roadmap but
rejected the settlement freeze--an essential element.

So again, we are going to continue to press for a settlement freeze,
arguing that unless Palestinians see that there is some change on the
ground, telling Palestinians that there may be some temporary,
provisional, borderless state that is the size of an Indian reservation
is not going to end anything.

Q: Given the situation on the ground right now, and given
this road map, which offers Palestinians a state in 2004 or 2005, can
you make any assessments as to what you see in the near and far future?

A: If the international community actually believes that it wants an
end to the conflict, then they will put in place the measures that are
necessary to end it--enforcing the law against Israel and its
colonization and starting to apply sanctions.

If the United States, the world community and Israel itself do not do
that, then we are going to see the same level of colonization, we might
see mass numbers of people leaving the occupied Palestinian territories
or you might see an anti-apartheid movement in which you have millions
of Palestinians saying that they want to seek citizenship in the state
of Israel. I think that it will be a greater threat to
Israel--particularly if Israel wants to remain what it calls a ""Jewish
state""--to have an additional 3.5 million Palestinians seeking Israeli
citizenship.

Q: I understand that your office has given the United States
a memo stating that the Palestine Liberation Organization may be forced
to change its two-state strategy.

A: We have basically concluded that if the colonization continues at
this pace, we are going to have to start questioning whether a two-state
solution is even plausible. That is not to say that we are not committed
to the two-state solution; the PLO has been committed to that since 1988.

But given the facts on the ground, given the way that things have
changed, one cannot unscramble an egg. The leadership is going to have
to start reassessing whether it really should be pushing for a two-state
solution or whether we should start pushing for equal citizenship and an
anti-apartheid campaign along the same lines as South Africa.
"
"Isr","Neut","Assassinations, or as they are termed in Israel, ""targeted killings,""
are nothing new to the Israeli intelligence community. But over the
years, at least until the 1970s, they were considered a last resort, a
means to be employed rarely and wisely.

There were a few reasons for this caution. First, many in the
intelligence community thought over the years that espionage was not
mafia-style Murder, Inc. More important, the policy of targeted killings
is a double-edged sword. What you do to your opponents, they can do to you.

The first time Israeli intelligence carried out an assassination was on
July 11, 1956. Colonel Mustafa Hafez, Egyptian commander of military
intelligence in the Gaza Strip and the man responsible for sending the
fedayeen infiltrators to Israel, was killed when a book he received
exploded.

The use of mail bombs became a central tool in the 1960s, especially in
harrassing and assassinating German (former Nazi) scientists who were
involved in developing advanced weapons for Egypt.

After the Six-Day War, the fight against Palestinian terror, both in the
territories and beyond the borders of Israel, moved assassinations up
the ladder of Israeli intelligence priorities. But the watershed was the
murder of 11 Israeli athletes in Munich in 1972 by ""Black September,"" a
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) front. Then Prime Minister Golda
Meir ordered Mossad head Zvi Zamir to embark upon a campaign of targeted
killings of anyone directly or indirectly connected with the athletes'
murder.

It was the first time in the history of Israeli intelligence that it had
been directed to initiate a ""project""--not a one-time killing but a
systematic elimination of dozens of people.

A pattern was set in motion at that time that became the basis for
similar operations to this day. Intelligence compiled a list of targets;
today it is known as a ""bank"". A special, limited forum known as the ""X
Committee"" had the authority to approve Mossad requests to eliminate a
person on the list. The X Committee would consult the attorney general,
who served as a one-man court, sentencing the suspect to death.

This was also the first time that the motive for the assassination was
revenge. Although it was couched in lofty terms like ""deterrence"" and
""future prevention"" of terror, it was clear that the urge to avenge the
deaths of the Israeli athletes was the main reason for the decision.

The systematic assassination campaign suffered a near fatal blow in July
1973 in Lillehammer, Norway, when Mossad gunmen, out to eliminate Ali
Hassan Salameh, who was believed to be the brains of Black September,
mistakenly shot and killed a Moroccan waiter, Ahmed Boushiki.

The failure in Norway brought several questions into sharp relief: Are
targeted killings worthwhile? If so, who should the targets be? Although
clear answers have never been formulated, a kind of tacit understanding
was reached whereby targeted killings are permissible, in certain
circumstances, but the use of this weapon must be cautious, wise and rare.

It was advisable that only senior operational commanders should be
targeted, those whose deaths would result in a serious impairment of the
organizations' operational capabilities. Responsibility should not be
taken publicly so that Israel would not appear to be using terror
itself, and so that its relations with other countries were not damaged,
as they were with Norway and with Jordan after the attempt to
assassinate Hammas leader Khaled Mashaal in 1997.

The intelligence community also assumes that it is possible, even
desirable, to hit leaders of small organizations, those that are no more
than a ""one-man show."" Fathi Shikaki, leader of the Islamic Jihad, was
killed in October 1995 on the assumption that killing him would put an
end to the capabilities of his small organization. His presumed
successor, Abdullah Ramadan Shalah, was considered ineffectual and
lacking in leadership capabilities.

Those assumptions were proved wrong. Shalah proved to be a capable
leader, and Islamic Jihad in Gaza has produced some of the worst suicide
bombings of recent years.

The most important element that is always taken into consideration in
discussions between the intelligence chiefs and the political echelon is
the cost-benefit ratio. If the assassination leads to a severe response
on the part of the terror organizations, then it was a losing proposition.

This consideration was apparently either forgotten when it came to the
targeted killing of the director-general of Hezbollah, Abbas Moussawi,
in southern Lebanon in 1992, or those who made the decision operated on
the basis of mistaken assumptions. Hezbollah's response was stinging:
two car bombs in Buenos Aires, against the buildings housing the Israel
Embassy and the Jewish community organization, in which more than 100
people were killed and many were injured.

With hindsight, there is no doubt that many in the intelligence
community believe that the 1988 decision to hit Khalil al-Wazir, Yasser
Arafat's deputy, also known as Abu Jihad, was a mistake. Looking back,
it is clear to many that his death left Arafat alone at the leadership
level of the PLO, without the counsel of a talented and pragmatic
strategist.

Always, even at the height of assassination wars, there was a kind of
silent agreement on both sides not to hit ""national"" leaders. Here and
there, exceptions cropped up, like the failed attempt of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine to kill then former Prime Minister
David Ben-Gurion during a visit to Scandinavia in the 1960s, or plans
devised already in the late 1960s and again in Lebanon in 1982 to kill
Arafat.

Already in 1998, after the failed attempt against Meshal, the
subcommittee for intelligence and security services of the Knesset which
investigated the case published an unprecedented critical statement in
which it said,""for many years the governments of Israel have not
formulated policies in the war against terror organizations that are
based on fundamental thought processes and continuity..."".

But over the last three years, and especially with the unwise decision
to kill Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, all the basic assumptions and past lessons
have been forgotten or abandoned. From a weapon of last resort,
assassination has become the most available of weapons; from wise and
cautious use, it is now widespread and wholesale.

This change has damaged another, mainly psychological, assumption: the
mystery that surrounded previous assassinations cast fear into the
hearts of the enemy by their very rarity and sophistication. That
mystery dissipates the moment the act becomes routine. This, more than
anything else, shows the long road the Israel Defense Forces and the
intelligence and security forces have traveled, from daring and
creativity to paralyzed thinking.
"
"Pal","Neut","I was apprehensive all night as the TV satellite reception was
dysfunctional, a usual sign of Israeli spy drones invading our skies
when they are on their way to prepare a kill.

At 5:20 am, I was awakened by the thundering noise of the low flying
F16, another sign of the Israelis closing in on a target. Five minutes
later I heard a distant explosion and the local Palestinian TV station,
the only available source of news, announced the assassination of Sheikh
Ahmad Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas.

Immediately, Gaza was sealed off by the Israel Defense Forces, as was
the West Bank--a prison locked. The skies filled with dark clouds of
smoke as burning tires suddenly appeared in every corner. Tens of
thousands gathered in the streets demanding revenge as the funeral
procession of Yassin made its way to the cemetery. Gaza had never been
this way before. Every man and woman was shaken with apprehension of
what will come next.

The killing of Yassin was not surprising. Israeli officials recently
declared that everyone, including the leaders of militant groups, is a
legitimate target. It was obvious that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon was incensed by the suicide bombing in Ashdod, not only because a
number of Israelis were killed, but because it proved that infiltration
inside Israel remains possible in defiance of the notorious wall Israel
has constructed and all of its other security measures.

Indeed, this whole story can be viewed as another form of the tribal
revenge and retaliation that has continued for more than three years.
Politicians and commentators are declaring that Sharon is mad and that
by killing Yassin, he is throwing the whole area, if not the world, into
chaos. But I don't think Sharon is mad or acting in retaliation. He has
a plan, and it is working.

Sharon has succeeded in turning the clock back, destroying the Oslo
agreement and the Palestinian Authority as a partner. Sharon has decided
that peace is a mortal danger to Israel because it entails giving up the
land in the West Bank. More seriously, Sharon is determined to kill the
dream of the ""loony left"" of a binational state. He is ready to
sacrifice even more Jews to stop it. Violation of international law is
unimportant and the number of Palestinians murdered is of no
consequence. Yassin is just another number on Sharon's list; there will
be many to follow.

The killing of Yassin may well be one of the final nails in the coffin
of the Palestinian Authority, after Sharon has meticulously carved it
piece by piece into nothing. Not only intent on destroying the
Authority, Sharon is all the more determined to kill any future
partner--including Hamas.

Interestingly, Yassin once accepted an end to the conflict, one that
included a Palestinian state next to Israel, and thus abandoned the
dream of an Islamic state in historic Palestine. His main target was to
end the Israeli occupation. It is important to remember that Hamas and
all forms of resistance were born out of the Israeli occupation.

Last summer Yassin was instrumental in bringing to bear a unilateral
ceasefire that held for nearly two months. Yassin was much-respected.
His killing has elevated him to the level of sainthood, to a powerful
model of martyrdom.

In the aftermath of Yassin's murder, Hamas could credibly strengthen its
hold and assume the leadership in Palestine as President Yasser Arafat's
Authority has degenerated into a symbol of humiliation and impotence.
This was ingeniously executed by Sharon, helped--no doubt--by the
Palestinian lack of leadership and vision, and at times assisted by
blessings from the White House.

The killing of Sheikh Yassin in his wheelchair outside a mosque
following the dawn prayer will not make Israel a safer place. It may
temporarily offer Sharon safety in his position as he embarks on a new
level of violence that will in turn make Hamas more popular and more
militant and Israelis more frightened. Tragically, the logic of terror
has played out very well for Sharon, while helping the Bush Corporation.
Sharon desperately needs a Palestinian retaliation that will strengthen
his hand against his domestic foes.

But it may all go wrong for Sharon and Bush alike as the truth
shockingly becomes more apparent, and were the new leadership of Hamas
to consider a dramatic change of course. It is not an impossibility to
imagine new Gaza Hamas leader Abdel Aziz Rantisi on the screen telling
Israelis that he opposes more corpses and wants a just peace--telling
them that, indeed, revenge is not his game.

In the killing of Yassin, only the death camp can rejoice. But this will
be short-lived, as life always wins in the end. This is the lesson of
history.

"Isr","Neut","The first conclusion that the Israeli political and security
establishment should learn and internalize after 18 months of
Palestinian Intifada, concerns the intensity of Palestinian blind
terrorism and guerilla warfare against the State of Israel and the
entire Israeli presence between the Jordan and the Mediterranean. These
have reached dimensions that are both painful and impressive from the
standpoint of the use of force. This is relevant not only for the Jewish
public in Eretz-Israel and the world, but for most international actors,
large and small, whatever their direct stake in the outcome.

Thus the upgrading of Palestinian warfare over the past year and a half
arouses concern. It obliged the Israeli government in April 2002 to
initiate a large-scale military offensive against Palestinian terrorist
concentrations in all the Arab cities of the West Bank (except Jericho,
Hebron and East Jerusalem) and surrounding Arab villages. This
counterattack clearly reflected the Israel Defense Forces' force
superiority in direct encounters with Palestinian terrorist bases. On
the other hand, international pressures exercised by the United States,
Europe and the United Nations forced Israel to withdraw the better part
of its forces from most of the territories they occupied--a withdrawal
that revealed, and apparently will continue to reveal, unnecessary acts
of Israeli cruelty.

In the absence of a fair political solution for the realization of the
Palestinian people's legitimate right to self
determination--independence alongside Israel, not instead of
Israel--brutal Palestinian terrorism will continue. In the not too
distant future it will provoke new temporary IDF conquests, which in
turn will generate intensified international pressures on Israel,
followed by a renewed and temporary IDF withdrawal, and so on and on in
a routine of bloodshed, until the only possible and fair political
solution is realized: the establishment of an independent Palestinian
state alongside Israel, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whose
government operates in East Jerusalem. Such a solution will inevitably
require the removal of a number of Israeli settlements from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. It is apparent that without energetic pressure and
intervention by the world's powers, led by the US, Israelis and
Palestinians will not succeed on their own in compromising on a
permanent peace agreement.

Meanwhile it behooves us to focus on two negative phenomena that are
increasingly taking root in the Israeli reality. First, Israeli security
circles are becoming captivated by the ritual of fences. This approach
is based on a vain trust that failed as far back as 1938, when the
British built the ""northern fence"" along the border with Lebanon. It
makes sense to put up political fences to separate nations and states,
but only after they have reached clear political understandings, and if
possible peace agreements. A strategic fence without a political
agreement is a pointless waste. Unfortunately, for some people in Israel
the notion of a fence is replacing political peace arrangements.

Secondly, there is slowly developing a dangerous dynamic among Israel's
Arab citizens. The more extreme the Palestinian struggle against Israel
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the stronger the negative suffusion of
Palestinian hatred for Israel into the hearts of Israeli Arabs. This is
an unnecessary additional injection of venom into Israel's future. It
must not be ignored, lest this important Arab public, which has been
slowly coming to terms with its fate of living together with us in a
modern democratic country, now ally itself with our enemies.

In conclusion, note the interesting statement by General Peterson, from
a visiting delegation of pro-Israel retired American generals (Yediot
Aharonot, April 26, 2002, Saturday Supplement, p. 11): ""Al Qaida exists
and will continue to exist as long as there is a situation where people
live without hope. This is the infrastructure where al-Qaida soldiers
will be found."" In my assessment, this perceptive analysis by an
American general is doubly applicable to the Palestinian
people.
"
"Pal","Neut","In looking around and assessing almost 19 months of Palestinian
resistance to the Israeli occupation, one recognizes that Palestinians
have undergone some important changes (I will refrain from calling these
gains or losses, since the storm has not settled into calm).

One of the most crucial changes among Palestinians is that their peace
euphoria has come to a more rational and rather depressing end. The
strong belief among Palestinians was that Israeli stubbornness and the
hard and endless negotiations were only intended to extract the maximum
from the Palestinian negotiators--we all thought that Israel would be
leaving in the end. This belief proved wrong and we have been forced to
recognize that Israelis are not yet ready for historical compromise, one
similar to the dramatic transformation of South Africa.

I remember how, after the signing of the Oslo accords, my children and I
left our house holding olive branches and waving them in the streets of
Ramallah. I was surprised that day to see an Israeli soldier kick my
son's hands with his boots in anger. I did not understand why. I thought
a soldier like him should have been happy to leave a land not belonging
to him, in which he was obliged to do a ""nasty job"" against a hostile
population. Many years later, I realized that he was not happy because
he did not want to leave. Perhaps he thought, as many Israelis still do,
that this land must be his.

For me, as for many other Palestinians, the parameters for a real peace
were measured in the size of the nearest settlement to one's house. Is
it shrinking or expanding? The settlement closest to me was continuously
expanding and this meant for me, very simply, that there was no peace,
but only attempts to steal more land. I began to believe that it was
only a question of time until the coming confrontation.

With this in mind, I waited for a Palestinian strategy, one that would
explain to the people what awaits them and how to be prepared. To my
surprise, however, the Palestinian leadership has been silent. Now most
people, including myself, are watching Arab satellite channels, in
particular Al Manar owned by Hezballah, to get some analysis of the
""situation"" and to find some direction. I remember in the first months
of what became the ""Al Aqsa Intifada,"" how Palestinians waited to hear
anything from their leadership--clarification describing what is
happening and why it is happening and to what end--to no avail. There
were many symbolic military actions--heavy firing in demonstrations and
the funerals of martyrs, masked people wearing black uniforms and
weighted down with belts of bullets--but after the funerals and
demonstrations, there was nothing else for someone like me to contribute.

I was an active participant in the first uprising, and I have heard many
people say that this uprising is the one that will liberate us. Its
motto has been to ""endure all of the pain for one hour, instead of
suffering for many hours."" That led me to believe that we would be asked
to do much more than in the first uprising. I thought that the skills
and experience we had gained at mobilizing support from all over the
world would be more enhanced, more organized and more systematic than in
the first uprising. I thought that we would have a clearer message for
and discourse with the Israelis, the Arabs and the rest of the world.
That message should have been that after seven years of waiting and
endless negotiations, what we gained were more settlements, more land
confiscation, more suffocating blockades and humiliation.

My faith that we would be able to send a consistent and powerful message
to the world came out of the fact that now we had our national
institutions, various ministries and long-awaited expertise from the
Diaspora. I thought that if the first uprising succeeded in bringing the
likes of Hanan Ashrawi into the media spotlight, this uprising,
alongside our national institutions, would bring tens or maybe hundreds
of Hanans to face the cunning and sophisticated Israeli propaganda
machine. I thought that more careful civil defense measures would be
taken to protect people's lives and to prepare them for a long
resistance, a resistance inevitable to finally gain their freedom. I
thought that we would see a full-scale strategy to prepare Palestinians
for long sieges and more brutal military ""incursions,"" whether by
preparing shelters, makeshift hospitals, better communications and so
on. None of this happened and instead, I saw chaos.

Wherever you went, national institutions lacked mandate and defined
responsibilities. Everywhere, people were engaged in internal conflicts
and many direly needed service and development projects were aborted
because of those conflicts.

As a member of the public, I felt that we took the role of a passive
audience, while the armed men became the main actors. I have read about
the relationship between civilians and militants in many revolutions.
Most of the literature out there speaks of genuine and productive
relationships. But in our case, the militants, too, were not saying
much. Why the arms? For what purpose? And what is the role of the people
in relation to them? Many questions went without clear answers.

I, like many others, was skeptical over the value of we called
""takhtakhat,"" or sporadic shootings. But people did embrace and support
well-planned and successful targeted military operations against Israeli
settlers and soldiers. The public was divided concerning suicide attacks
inside Israel, but Israeli brutalities filled many people's hearts with
the desire for revenge. Politically undirected revenge, however, can be
a gift in the lap of one's enemy and I am one of those who believes this
is exactly what happened. We gave a prime minister like Ariel Sharon
with his vast criminal record the chance to shed more Palestinian blood
and to distort the main aim of our struggle of ending the Israeli
occupation.

Yes, we have gained the support of many peoples all over the world. We
have managed to present once again the naked reality on the ground, the
reality of an occupied people under a classic foreign occupation. But we
made great sacrifices and suffered dramatically for this result. Perhaps
that might have been minimized, if we were better organized, if we had
participated in the decisions made, if we were treated as citizens and
not as ""clients.""

The only way to get closer to our goals of liberty and independence is
to change. In order to defeat our occupiers, we must be empowered as a
people and draw the best from each capable person, attracting the merits
from each individual.

The last Israeli incursion in March 29 has once again put the people on
the right track. It encouraged individual initiative, public solidarity,
heroism and spirit to rid us of this ugly occupation. The only way that
this spirit will stay alive is through real democracy and respect for
initiatives from the people.

"
"Pal","Neut","Track II talks achieved unprecedented success through the Oslo
breakthrough, which raised their status in the arena of negotiations and
diplomacy. This breakthrough paved the way for the phenomenal burgeoning
of unofficial track II dialogues, each one with high hopes that the new
track would be the next to become an official negotiating track,
bringing with it success and fame.

But to achieve this, each second track must consider a group of factors:

1) The Palestinian leadership must offer cursory review of the track
proposal and its goals, in order to get official support, encouragement,
blessing or--in the worst case scenario--simple acknowledgement. The
closer the leadership stands in relationship to the hierarchical head,
the better the track's possibilities.
2) The leadership should also propose names to represent it or
knowledgeable parties to follow the activities of the track in question.
The higher their rank or the more they enjoy the favor of the president
or the leadership, the better the chances in the eyes of the donor
parties or Israeli side.
3) The leadership should be presented with detailed reports after the
end of each round that amplify the achievements, however minor, and
highlight the participants on the Israeli side.
4) The caliber of the Israeli participants is still the main indicator
of a second track's importance to the leadership.

The Palestinian leadership itself has held varying positions on this
sort of unofficial activity, depending on the political period. Even
within the leadership, there have been varying positions towards track
II activities. There were many who have persistently opposed them for
fear of the status of the original official negotiations, and for fear
that any track might branch out like an octopus to devour the official
track or dwarf it.

Some of these fears are justified, especially due to the absence of a
body for coordinating track II activities, either inside a framework to
benefit official talks or inside the group of second tracks. Track II
work patterns and mechanisms are generally not subject to any laws or
methodology, which adds to the dangers: poor coordination, the
possibility that basic conditions for holding such meetings do not exist
or that participants do not have the necessary knowledge or expertise.

Despite the obvious dangers, the leadership is never truly threatened
since these groupings do not exceed the pursuit of social activities
that aspire to develop into something more with the consent of the
leadership. Therefore, the leadership has veto power, which allows it to
be more hands-off in dealing with this negotiating activity, offering
respite from interventions over details or the imposition of strictness
over various initiatives.

It is clear to all that some of these tracks have been a nuisance for
the leadership because of the subjects they have proposed or because of
the positions that were signed or agreed upon by some track II
participants at the expense of the official first track. The result was
to put indirect pressure on the leadership's positions on the same
subjects. The lack of vision in some tracks has embarrassed the
leadership, especially those where participants were affiliated with the
leadership. Even so, there has never been a final position from the
Authority banning such tracks or impeding their work. At times, the
Authority has distanced itself from the second tracks as much as
possible. Still, it has never completely broken ties, perhaps because
the interests of its officials involved in second tracks sometimes
exceed those of the Authority. Right now, official interest is
heightened and is encouraging these tracks because no official contacts
exist.

Returning to the Oslo breakthrough, this was the first time that a
second track succeeded in having its status elevated to that of official
talks. The reason for the success was the absence of an official
negotiations track at the time. One might say that as long as there is
an official negotiating track, track II talks have no chance of
breakthrough. Instead, they are attempts to provide constructive
suggestions for loosening up negotiating restraints on the first track.
So far, however, this has proven a failure. Official negotiators
purposely refuse to even look into track II ideas and proposals so as
not to give credence to their importance and so as not to recognize the
principle of a supposed integral relationship between the first and
second tracks.

There is no doubt that a second track is a treasure trove from which
official negotiators might benefit if it is organized and its work
mechanisms coordinated with the leadership, without domination. As such,
it is important that there is no breakthrough of the second track unless
the first founders or is suspended.

The present state of negotiations is showing the heightened importance
of the second track and even the emergence of tracks somewhere between
official and unofficial. This type of hybrid track represents the peak
of danger for participants in the first track because they are poised to
become the alternative if the first track remains stalled. Therefore,
the survival instinct in the activists of the first track forces new
ways of negotiating and any means possible of semi-official
communication to remain at the top of the negotiating pyramid. At this
stage, we see this in abundance.

There are many track II negotiations. Some are one-off deals, and others
are sustained. Some follow natural relationships between the Israeli and
Palestinian sides, in the form of people-to-people and joint cooperation
projects. Some pursue the issue of negotiating in different forms, and
then translate that into different levels. Some reflect professionalism,
seriousness and negotiating creativity. With all these species, one must
give each a fair evaluation. Competition is not the issue here, even
though it consumes the thoughts of those involved in official talks. One
must remember that serving the homeland does not require permission from
anyone.
"
"Isr","Neut","It is tempting--in view of the coincidence of the third anniversary of
the al Aqsa intifada, the tenth anniversary of the Oslo accords, the
30th anniversary of the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War and the 25th
anniversary of the Camp David accords
                                             that led to
Israeli-Egyptian peace--to compare two Israel-Arab conflicts and their
outcomes. Will the effect of hundreds of dead, thousands of disabled and
billions of dollars that the Israeli public has been paying out since
October 2000, ultimately resemble that of the October 1973 trauma? (I'll
leave the questions regarding the Palestinian balance to my Palestinian
colleagues.) What has to happen in order for Israelis to reach the
conclusion that on the eastern front, like on the southern front,
political accommodation with a neighbor offers a better guarantee of
security than disputed territories, and that a peace that resembles
non-belligerency is better than any kind of war?

It is argued that there is no room to compare the open spaces of Sinai
and the Egyptian border, far from the nearest Israeli settlement, with
the West Bank and Gaza Strip border, located within primitive mortar
range of central Israel. Some say that a peace agreement with a stable
and orderly Arab state like Egypt in no way even resembles an agreement
with a Palestinian organization that hasn't decided whether or not it
really wants to become a stable and orderly country. They argue that
while Egypt concluded that it could not defeat Israel, there are still
Palestinian leaders who believe that terrorism can win the struggle
against Israel.

The conclusion drawn from an analysis of these distinctions is that
Israel cannot permit itself in the foreseeable future to give up
strategic territories in the West Bank and Gaza--a conclusion only
confirmed by the abortive attempt, in the course of the 1991 Madrid
process and the 1993 Oslo agreement
                                           , to abandon military
solutions in favor of a political option. After Ehud Barak persuaded
them that the Palestinians rejected his ""generous offer"", Israelis have
blocked their minds to the argument that terrorist attacks in Tel Aviv
are a response to the occupation of Hebron.

But in order for this comparison to be complete, we must address the
time factor. Imagine that Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had waited
another quarter of a century before coming to Jerusalem to offer full
peace in return for all the territories conquered by Israel from Egypt.
Imagine that instead of 6,000 settlers who had moved to Sinai during the
ten years between 1967 and Sadat's historic visit, there were 230,000
Jews in Sinai, who had settled the region in the course of 36 years
since the Six Day War. Would the Sharon-Lieberman-Eitam government
evacuate Yamit, which in due course would have grown into a city like
Maaleh Adummim with tens of thousands of residents? It is certainly
possible that under these circumstances Sadat would never have come to
Jerusalem, and that Israel, burdened with conflict on its eastern flank
and tension on its northern border, would now have to deploy sizeable
contingents in its southern theater as well, to confront a large and
powerful Arab army. And under these circumstances, Jordan would be hard
put to maintain its peace agreement with Israel.

Three years of intifada have opened the eyes of the world, including the
United States, to recognize that, as in the case of the Israeli-Egyptian
(and Israeli-Syrian) conflict, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict also has
two sides: terrorism, and territory. The roadmap
                                                , born of the intifada,
asserts that the lack of symmetry between the murder of children and the
theft of land need not absolve Israel of the obligation to at least
dismantle outposts that it itself has determined are illegal and to
freeze construction in existing settlements. For the time being the
roadmap has reached a dead end due to the Palestinians' difficulty in
dismantling terrorist organizations as if there were no occupation, and
the Israelis' problem with dismantling settlements as if there were no
terrorism.

To extricate themselves from this ""catch"", the Palestinians must
overcome domestic constraints and start acting unilaterally against
terrorism. Only this will allow domestic and external pressures to force
Israel to respond by acting in the territorial dimension and beginning
to remove settlements. After three years of useless suffering, there are
indications that the Palestinians are beginning to recognize that the
horror and the anger generated among Israelis by terrorism override any
logical consideration with regard to issues like the demographic danger,
economic decline and even damage to quality of life. If these
indications are converted into deeds, then the past three years will not
have been lost, and thousands of victims will not have died in vain.
"
"Pal","Neut","On its third anniversary, the intifada has been the subject of a great
deal of analyses, articles and essays. A quick review of the writings
that appeared after the first, second and now third year of the uprising
shows that they have many points of agreement, particularly regarding
the intifada's achievements and accomplishments. There is marked
departure, however, in assessing the dangers the Palestinian people now
face.

The gamble made by the Palestinian leadership--and one initially fully
justified--relied on the assumption that escalating Israeli military
measures and aggression reap Arab and international solidarity. But this
is no longer an easy gamble, as matters today appear quite the reverse.
This change is very serious and worthy of our attention; we can neither
ignore it nor let it divert us from the main dispassionate truth of the
Palestinian national struggle, a truth that has been a major factor on
our success thus far.

This truth is that the Palestinian national movement is not like other
liberation movements in circumstance or its source of power. It cannot,
for instance, achieve its goals on its own; the Palestinian people alone
cannot win the quasi-military battle against Israel. Therefore, without
effective external support and energized Arab and international
solidarity backing the intifada, our national movement will remain
stationary, waiting for such assistance.

It is not an exaggeration to say that recent years have altered the
international and regional environment and gradually shifted all levels
of influence in the political process from inside the occupied
territories to outside. This change demands the parallel reinforcement
of political and media energies abroad, particularly in the public
arena, in order to form a broad international front supporting the
Palestinian people's struggle and enabling them to achieve their goal of
terminating the Israeli occupation.

This brings us back to the question, ""What has the intifada achieved in
its third year?"" What can it achieve under these circumstances, given
the international and regional transformation?

The intifada succeeded in aborting as a solution for the Palestine
question the unjust and incomplete Camp David negotiations, which were
crafted to relinquish Jerusalem and the refugees' right to return, and
to keep settlement blocs and the borders of the Palestinian state under
Israeli control. The intifada also discredited the American ideas that
were offered in the same framework. It succeeded in enhancing commitment
to our national goals and rejuvenating the Palestinian struggle.
Furthermore, it substantiated American bias towards Israel and
reinforced Palestinian national unity between the factions, particularly
in the field. The intifada unmasked Israel's lack of seriousness towards
attaining a just political solution that would fulfill Palestinian
demands, halted an increasing normalization process with Israel, and
refocused international public opinion on the need to find a solution
for the Palestinian question.

Finally, the intifada demonstrated that it is impossible to impose
solutions on the Palestinians by unilaterally changing the facts of the
occupation on the ground (despite that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon remains convinced of this possibility). The uprising has verified
that there is no room for a dual authority--Palestinian national
authority and the occupation's authority--over one people in this small
geographic area, the occupied territories. There is no way that a
national authority that seeks independence for its people can coexist
with a foreign occupation whose objective is to abolish every pillar of
this independence.

But tracking these events alone do not provide us with a comprehensive
view of what happened and what might happen yet. The Palestinian
intifada cannot, solely on its own, shift from a defensive posture
upholding national rights and demands to a political offensive intended
to reap achievements. Indeed, the intifada has remained almost static
since the close of its first year.

For one, the intifada has not succeeded in becoming an uprising beyond
these borders, as some had wished. To date, it has not succeeded in
mobilizing serious political engagement that has the possibility of
ending the occupation, nor has it been able to use the pressures that do
exist to hasten a just solution. It has not accelerated the rhythm of
Arab solidarity, nor realized the slogans promising an international
investigation committee, nor broken the American monopoly on the
negotiations process. It has not provided international protection, or
even lifted the physical siege imposed on the Palestinian people and
their elected president.

Obviously, these failures are not solely the responsibility of the
intifada, but one cannot ignore what the intifada has reaped in the form
of pressures on the Palestinians. Other factors contributing to these
failures include the elimination of the intifada's public protests and a
shift to armed confrontations, a response forced by violent Israeli
measures when all political options had been curtailed.

Internal, regional and international changes have all played a role in
imposing a political embargo on the intifada. The absence of an
objective reading of these changes by some Palestinian streams that
ignore the importance of external pressure has contributed greatly to
the situation's deterioration.

These changes included the right-wing's control over Israel with Ariel
Sharon as prime minister, and the events of September 11 in the United
States which then led to the so-called ""war against terrorism.""
Afterwards, the Israeli army invaded all of the Palestinian Authority
areas, and the United States prepared for a war against Iraq and
threatened countries in the region that they must fight terrorism.

Under these circumstances, the Palestinian leadership accepted the
roadmap                                                 . This meant
that the intifada would have begun politically with Palestinian
rejection of the Camp David formula and calls that international law be
implemented, only to end in its third year with acceptance of the
roadmap. The political gap between those two formulas is the best
expression of the bottleneck that now exists, one that is growing
increasingly complex and dangerous considering the recent Israeli
decision to remove President Yasser Arafat.

How then can we exit this situation? It is clear that we can, if we
master reading the changes underway and deal with them rationally and
with farsightedness, without surrendering or subjugating ourselves in
the process. The first step in this direction is to avoid any activity
that might label the Palestinian national struggle as ""terrorism"". The
second step is to reconsider the intifada's public component, which has
lain dormant for some time, by diverting confrontations with the
occupation to a political arena where the enemy has little room to
maneuver.

Even Benjamin Netanyahu, who now adopts positions more extreme than
those of Ariel Sharon, was compelled as Israeli prime minister--under
international and regional pressure--to accept the Hebron Protocol and
relinquish 13 percent of the West Bank in the Wye agreement. When he was
asked why he changed, he replied, ""I did not, but the circumstances did.""

Sharon's security conditions and demands that Palestinians dismantle
what he calls the ""infrastructure of terrorism"" are no different than
the demands of any previous Israeli leader, including Yitzhak Rabin,
Shimon Peres, Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak. But these leaders from
the left and right never achieved their demands and--because of Arab
pressure and the international climate--gave in on some basic matters in
the transitional agreements. It is /the environment/ that has now
transformed these demands into real pressure on Palestinians and allowed
Sharon to impede political progress while he enjoys the world's sympathy
for his positions.

Even this right-wing government had to change its tack when faced with
resistance to the separation wall. Sharon has since declared that
annexing the Ariel settlement bloc inside the wall requires the right
political environment. This admission proves the importance of
international players--it can still be ill advised to reinforce
occupation with military force. Further confirmation lies in the United
Nations' vote where 133 nations stood opposed to Israel's decision to
remove Arafat.

It /is/ possible to employ efforts that will alter international
positions still more dramatically in favor of the Palestinian people,
their president and their leadership. This external support is an
instrument of pressure that no Israeli government can ignore.

Israel's leftist Labor Party has been in deep crisis since the failure
of its political project at Camp David three years ago. Likewise, the
right-wing Likud will face the same fate when it becomes clear that a
solution of surrender cannot be imposed by military means. Failure of
the Zionist right-wing's policy of force will create an opening for
solving the Palestinian question. This is the task that the intifada
must address in the coming period.

"Isr","Neut","Incitement against Israel and the Jews frequently appears in Arab school
textbooks and usually contains the following components:

* Denial of Jewish nationhood and of any valid connection between the
Jews and the land of Palestine. The State of Israel is thus presented as
an illegitimate usurper entity that should be erased from the map. Its
Jewish citizens are illegitimate inhabitants of the country and should
leave or be expelled.
* Israel and the Jews are presented as the source of tremendous
disasters that hit the Arabs, especially the Palestinians, as well as a
looming danger over the entire Arab world. Detailed and lively
descriptions of past and present atrocities attributed to both Israel
and the Jews make them easily demonized.
* To keep this demonized image intact, no information is given to the
school student about ordinary Jews or Israelis, their daily life,
culture, literature, society, history, religion, etc. On the contrary,
the vast majority of references to the Jews and Israelis are negative,
aimed at intensifying the hatred of both.
* The inevitable conclusion is that such evil should be fought and
uprooted by every possible means. The land of Palestine would thus be
liberated and the Palestinian refugees would return to their former
homes from which they were expelled by the usurpers. If this can be
partly achieved through negotiations and peace agreements, all the
better. But the final goal should never be forsaken. Vivid descriptions
of the ongoing struggle against the occupation of Palestine are to be
found in literature textbooks throughout the Arab world, accompanied by
emphasis on the traditional Islamic ideals of jihad and martyrdom, both
in the military context.

All the aforementioned points are present in the Arab curricula I have
studied. The differences between them are restricted to their various
degrees of openness and intensity. Syrian textbooks are the harshest
ones, as they contain virulent expressions against the Jews and Israel
and call for their annihilation. The Saudi books come next, followed by
the Egyptian ones, which still contain ugly anti-Semitic expressions and
a few cases in which war against Israel is advocated.

The new Palestinian books that since 2000 have been gradually introduced
into the PA school system (today they are used in eight grades out of
twelve, with two more grades intended to receive them next year), do not
contain such open calls. As such they differ from other Arab textbooks,
as well as from the Jordanian and Egyptian textbooks that the
Palestinian Authority itself reintroduced into the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip in 1994, and after discarding the copies of those same books
that had been cleansed of anti-Semitic expressions by the Israeli
administration there after 1967.

Yet, by presenting Israel not as a sovereign and legitimate state, but
rather as a usurper entity that occupied Palestine in 1948 (which
entails the absence of Israel's name from all maps and reference to its
pre-1967 territory by circumlocutions such as ""the lands of 1948""); by
not counting its 5.5 million Jewish citizens (unlike its one million
Arab citizens) among the inhabitants of the land; by demonizing Israel
and the Jews (by using phrases such as ""Tartar battalions"",
""slaughterers"", ""human wild beasts"", or by inserting a passage in a
literature textbook for grade 8 which reads: ""Your enemies killed your
children, split open your women's bellies, held your revered elderly men
by the beard and led them to the death pits""); by reasserting the
validity of the violent struggle against Israeli occupation while
blurring the exact geographic borders of such occupation; by encouraging
jihad and martyrdom (a poem taught in grade 7 reads: ""The flow of blood
gladdens my soul, as well as a body thrown upon the ground, skirmished
over by the desert predators"")--by all these means, the new textbooks
published by the Palestinian Authority prove to contain the same
components of incitement that are present in other Arab textbooks.

Israeli textbooks, on the other hand, look much different. Though they
may sometimes contain antagonistic phrases against Arabs (especially in
non-governmental ultra-religious schools), by and large they are free
from the afore-mentioned phenomena. One can find in them recognition of
the Palestinians' national movement and active advocacy for peace with
them, as well as objective information about Arab history and Islam,
samples of Arabic modern literature, and even rejection of prejudiced
views against Palestinians or Arabs. Above all, the textbooks present to

"
"Isr","Neut","In addition to everything else, the two peoples, Israelis and
Palestinians, caught up in their extended blood feud, also need to have
healthy memories and above average semantic capabilities. To the
repertoire of solutions that previously included the Oslo agreements
                  , the Clinton principles                       , the
Mitchell plan                        , the Tenet outline
                    , the Bush speech                     and the
roadmap,                         has now been added the ""hudna"".

This Islamic term has quickly entered Israeli parlance, though not
without a semantic controversy. Is a hudna merely a ""ceasefire"", as many
Palestinians argue, or does it also embody the added value of
""acquiescence"" that many Israelis seek to attribute to the term. These
nuances cannot be underestimated in cultures that attach almost magical
power to words.

Yet the issue of the meaning of ""hudna"" is not the only problem. Perhaps
for the first time, an agreement with the Palestinians is not splitting
Israeli society between opponents and supporters in accordance with the
traditional contours of right and left. Nearly every solution proposed
in the past enjoyed instinctive support on the left and automatic
rejection on the right. Not this time. It is still easy to find
energetic pockets of opposition on the extreme right that consider the
hudna a certain recipe for disaster, and enthusiastic support among
those on the left that see it as a first step toward a possible
settlement. But in between there is a very large contingent that swings
between hope and despair, that is prepared to give any step a chance,
but that is riddled with doubts regarding the possibility of success.

Not many oppose the hudna; after two years of hard bloodshed it is
difficult to find anyone who would not celebrate even a few days of
peace and quiet, a break in the mutual killing, and the economic
potential embodied in a ceasefire for hundreds of thousands of
unemployed and teetering businesses. But the lack of trust, based on
past experience, is deeper than ever. Even those who believe in the
honest intentions of factions within the Palestinian leadership are
skeptical concerning their capacity to enforce the hudna in the field.
For many, that skepticism is accompanied by misgivings concerning the
good intentions of the Israeli leadership and its ability to withstand
pressures from extremist elements within the right wing government. Even
the dismantling of illegal outposts has become a farce.

Thus only the Israeli stock market has reacted to the emergence of this
hudna with outright optimism, translated into an impressive rise in the
trading index. Everyone else is reacting with cautious pessimism. As
refugees of the euphoria that enveloped the Oslo agreements and victims
of the past three years of attrition, Israelis refuse to abandon
themselves to yet another hope that is liable to prove unfounded. This
attitude has swept many sectors of the Israeli public, regardless of the
question ""who is to blame"" and ""who started it."" The ""peace of the
brave"" has become the ceasefire of the exhausted, like a break between
rounds in a wrestling match.

This is not necessarily bad news. The same sense of fatigue, or worse,
presumably exists among the Palestinian public. Only extremists condemn
this exhaustion as an expression of embarrassing weakness. Sometimes a
collective, exactly like an individual, requires a sign of fatigue in
order to know when to stop. In society, as in our personal lives,
fatigue is a vital regulatory mechanism that signals the limits of force
and endurance. Only senseless individuals, or suicidal societies, do not
hear this internal signal.

Thus the hudna is good and right; perhaps its very modest nature as an
intermediate step offers hope. An intermission from the daily horrors is
exactly what the two societies need if they are to recall how it feels
to live a more normal life, and aspire once again to anchor this
normalcy in a real future agreement. When that time comes, Israelis will
be more sober and realistic as they encounter it.

In retrospect, one of the ""marketing"" mistakes of the Oslo agreements
within Israeli society was its presentation as a process of
reconciliation instead of as a political agreement. ""Reconciliation""
generates expectations that cannot reach fruition at this stage; a
political agreement is a more modest aspiration, wherein the hudna can
be the first phase.

Research done in both societies supports this approach. Despite the
suffering of both in the course of the past three years, a large number
of Israelis and Palestinians express a relatively high degree of trust
in the capacity to reach a political agreement, while only a small
number in both societies believes in ""reconciliation now."" Hence the
Israeli leadership must make every effort to contribute to the success
of the hudna. It owes this to the people.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: Can you explain why the ceasefire or hudna declared this
week by the Palestinian factions is important?

A: I think that many changes have happened in the region in this
period and all of the Palestinian factions have focused on these
changes. We want to make a serious decision to prevent disaster in the
area. There is a need to give an opportunity to the new Palestinian
government and to take the Palestinian people into a new stage.

Q: When you say disaster, what are you referring to? Were
their specific threats made?

A: Israel has destroyed our institutions, our cities and towns,
and continues with its aggression against our people. I think that the
resistance from the Palestinian people has succeeded in the face of this
difficult aggression, but we now have many problems. We tried to think
about our people and the difficulties they are facing on the ground. We
think that the hudna will offer an opportunity for our people to stay
powerful and continue the Palestinian struggle in a different way, [in
order] to achieve Palestinian rights.

Q: Is your faction Fateh unified in the hudna?

A: All of the Palestinian factions accepted the concept of the
hudna, but there were some differences about how to talk about it, how
to have one unified text talking about the hudna.

Q: Are you worried that the hudna might not work?

A: I am worried about the Israeli side. I have many suspicions
that the Israeli side will [not] react positively. The comments of the
Israeli side are not encouraging us and I think that the responsibility
now lies with the international community to put pressure on the Israeli
side and convince them or force them to accept the hudna and respond in
a positive way, which means to accept the prerequisites of the hudna.

Q: So you have no assurances really that Israel will
reciprocate?

A: We didn't get any guarantees, but the US did make a statement
saying that the hudna is ""a step in the right direction."" That is
important at this stage, but we are still waiting for more serious steps
pressuring the Israeli side. They [the US] asked us to give an
opportunity to the political track. The Palestinian leadership, the
Palestinian cabinet and the Palestinian people have answered positively
all the requests made of them. Now the pressure on the Israeli side has
to begin.

Q: US President George W. Bush has been very clear that,
while he supports a hudna, in the end the Palestinian Authority must
disarm the different factions.

A: During the negotiations in Aqaba, President Bush mentioned
this and [Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas] Abu Mazen was clear
in this meeting, telling him that he did not want confrontations among
the Palestinian people and didn't /need/ confrontation among the
Palestinian people. The hudna is a positive way to solve our problems
with each other and give the political track a chance.

President Bush accepted the idea and asked the prime minister to move
towards the hudna and implement a peace. Now the Palestinian people have
succeeded and it is time for the international community to implement
its part.

Q: Might the Fatah hudna extend longer than six months, if
things are moving forward?

A: If the Israeli side and the international community respond
positively to the hudna and we see changes on the ground, and the
Israeli side withdraws from all Palestinian cities and towns and we
return to the political track, then we will continue in the hudna. The
hudna is a set period at this stage, but it will be more sustainable if
we succeed in moving towards our aims.

Q: Do you think that the Palestinian people believe that
the hudna will improve their lives?

A: It depends. I think that the Palestinian people need a change.
We want to exit this situation, but under fair circumstances. We want to
see our people free and moving towards independence; we want to see the
internal and external siege lifted from Palestinian territory; we want
to see the siege lifted from the Palestinian leadership; we want to see
our prisoners out of Israeli jails, we want to see the end to the
Israeli assassination policy and move towards a new future. If people
see something changing on the ground, their confidence in the hudna will
increase and the people will be more committed to it. But if the
Israelis continue their aggression and their policies against our
people, rejecting implementation of their part of this hudna, then it
cannot continue.
"
"Isr","Neut","United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 (1967) has long been
considered a building block for peace in the Middle East. Its importance
derives from the fact that it was adopted unanimously by the council,
and was accepted by the parties to the conflict. The resolution as such
is of a recommendatory character.

The council laid down a few principles to be applied in future
negotiations: an Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967
(according to the French text, ""retrait des forces armees israeliennes
des territoires occupes""), the establishment of secure and recognized
boundaries, mutual recognition, freedom of navigation in international
waterways in the area, a just settlement of the refugee problem, and the
adoption of measures to guarantee the new boundaries.

Unfortunately the parties differ on the interpretation of UNSCR 242 on
several points. Two of these differences are discussed below: the
question of the scope of the withdrawal, and the refugee issue.

The Arab states and the Palestinians claim that the resolution calls for
a complete withdrawal of Israel to the 1967 borders. They base their
claim on a line in the preamble that emphasized ""the inadmissibility of
the acquisition of territory by war"", and on the above quoted French
version of the withdrawal clause in paragraph 1.

Israel is of the opinion that a withdrawal is required to secure and
recognized boundaries to be established by agreement, and not to the
1967 lines. Israel's claim is based on the following:

First, the English version of the withdrawal clause: if there is a
discrepancy with the French version, the English one should be preferred
since the proposal was drafted in English and most of the deliberations
in the council took place in English.

Second, a proposal to add the word ""the"" (withdrawal from ""the""
territories. . . ) was not adopted by the council.

Third, the call for withdrawal has to be interpreted in conjunction with
the call for the establishment of ""secure and recognized boundaries"".
This latter provision would have been meaningless if there had been a
call for full withdrawal to the 1967 lines.

And fourth, the provision on the inadmissibility of the acquisition of
territory by war reiterates the principle of international law that
occupation by itself does not justify annexation.

Turning to the problem of the refugees, while UNSCR 242 merely speaks of
a ""just settlement"" without determining what this solution should be,
and without limiting its scope to Palestinian refugees, the Arabs claim
that by implication the provision refers to earlier General Assembly
resolutions that recommended that the Palestinian refugees be permitted
to return to Israel. There is, however, no basis for this interpretation
in the text of the resolution.

To conclude, despite considerable disagreement on its interpretation,
UNSCR 242 is mentioned in many agreements between Israel and her
neighbors as the basis for any peaceful settlement. Let us hope that it
may also help us in the future to reach peaceful settlements with the
Palestinians as well as Syria and Lebanon.
"
"Pal","Neut","United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 once seemed to promise
Palestine a future. By emphasizing ""the inadmissibility of the
acquisition of territory by war,"" it rejected Israeli claims to the West
Bank including east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. And by reaffirming the
need for a ""just and lasting peace""--including ""a just settlement to the
refugee problem""--Palestine and her children seemed finally slated to
receive a viaticum of justice. But now, nearly 37 years later, Palestine
conjures up an ever-impossible dream and UNSCR 242 might actually renege
on its pledge of partial self-determination and justice.

Originally, UNSCR 242 represented as much victory as it did defeat. Five
months before its passage, Israel had ravished the remains of Palestine
in the Six-Day War, and ever since, the Palestinians there who had not
been killed or displaced by Israel were forced to live under military
occupation. Already, Israel had outraged the international community by
de facto annexing East Jerusalem, and already, extremist Zionists sought
to realize their dreams of replacing the indigenous Christian and Muslim
communities of ""Judea and Samaria"" (the West Bank) and Gaza with Jewish
immigrants.

UNSCR 242, however, reminded Israel and the world that the Palestinians
are people--they have rights and their historical and cultural
connections to their land should not be negated by any other. It
inspired hope among Palestinians as well as in the Arab world. Finally,
it seemed, the international community--which bore no small measure of
culpability for the conflict--had decided to assume some responsibility
for its vagaries and would ensure Israel's compliance with the law.

By the 1980s, UNSCR 242 became the clarion call for some Palestinian and
Israeli activists. Not only did it sanctify the ideal of Israel and
Palestine, living side by side in peace and security, it also charted a
path: Israel would withdraw from territories it seized in the 1967 War,
millions of Palestinian refugees would finally gain control over their
lives and be compensated for their losses, and the details of
cooperation and coexistence could presumably be negotiated, with
international support.

But for all the high-minded ideals and promise that UNSCR 242 held, many
Palestinians struggled in its celebration. Israel's independence less
than 20 years earlier had seen the loss of 78% of historic Palestine and
the expulsion of two-thirds of its indigenous Christian and Muslim
population. Accepting UNSCR 242 seemed to mean accepting that Palestine,
as a place where all her historic communities could live together, could
only exist in the remaining 22%. Further, UNSCR 242 could have been read
to prejudice many other basic claims as well. For example, although it
rearticulated the foundational principle of the post-World War II order
that territory may never be acquired by force, it only spoke of
""territories occupied in the recent conflict,"" and not territories
acquired by force in Israel's War of Independence, such as the 23% of
historic Palestine that Israel had seized in excess of the General
Assembly's partition recommendation.

Nevertheless, the Palestinian leadership did make the historic
compromise of accepting UNSCR 242--which, once Israel putatively
accepted it, served as the basis for the now-eviscerated Oslo peace
process. UNSCR 242 seemed to guarantee Palestinian refugees the same
package of rights that was accorded all other refugees under
international law. Forcing the refugees to subsist in squalor for
decades was not their choice to make, the leadership reasoned, and a
peace--even if not the ideal peace of a secular state of Palestine in
all of historic Palestine with equal rights and opportunities for
all--would be good for all involved. The Palestinian leadership had
determined that a Palestine in part of Palestine was better than no
Palestine at all.

That concession, however, bore very little in the way of fruit. While it
did eventually pave the way for limited autonomy in some Palestinian
population centers, the occupation persists and the refugees' redemption
is but a rallying cry of a nation almost defeated. In fact, Israel has
stepped up its conquest of Palestinian territory, erecting a wall to
both shield its illegal colonies and stake out more territory.
Palestinians are literally being encaged and entire villages and
communities are fading into the unforgiving shadows of history. Far from
ushering in a new era of two states living side by side in peace and
security, UNSCR 242 has only seen one state ravenously devour any
prospects for the future of another.

In fact, UNSCR 242 might actually serve as one of the chief rhetorical
weapons in the destruction of the two-state solution, if it hasn't
already. At its heart, UNSCR 242 is about boundaries and lines. The
boundaries and lines that UNSCR 242 suggests sketch the territorial
basis of the two-state solution. It says that Israel may not forcibly
acquire territory beyond the Green Line; and that security and
recognition should be accorded all states in the region, not just Israel.

Israeli politicians, however, routinely bastardize the language of UNSCR
242 to justify realities and practices entirely outside of its purview.
Although the language and drafting history of UNSCR 242 clearly
demonstrates that its intent was not to sanction Israeli conquest of
Palestine's remains, ""pro-Israeli"" politicians and polemicists bully its
words to support Israeli settlement activity. Obviously, this activity
threatens to destroy any possibility of a Palestinian state, much less
the minimum guaranteed by UNSCR 242. Already, Israel's colonies have
fragmented the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The Israeli human
rights organization B'tselem reports that Israel's colonies have
incorporated nearly 42% of the West Bank into their jurisdictional
boundaries. And the remaining 58% of the 21% of historic Palestine more
closely resembles the scattered shards of a broken vase than any
state-in-the-making. By perverting the language and intent of UNSCR 242
to accept this activity, these ""Israeli advocates"" blur the lines that
formed the basis of the resolution, rattling the very foundation of the
two-state solution.

And there's one added irony: Just as UNSCR 242 represented the
international community assuming responsibility for a problem that it
created, it may also become emblematic of the international community's
ambivalence. The Palestinians claim the weight of international law--not
just UNSCR 242, but also General Assembly resolution 194, and the recent
ruling of the International Court of Justice, as well as international
customs and treaties. Israel, however, has thumbed its nose at
international law and the international community by consistently and
fragrantly violating this body of principles. And the international
community has acquiesced, all the while paying lip service to UNSCR
242's increasingly improbable promise.

So perhaps UNSCR 242's Palestine has come and gone. Perhaps the
moderates have acquiesced to the zealots. Perhaps Palestine's only hope
lies in her original image of one secular, democratic state, with equal
rights for all, regardless of ethnicity or religion. But this much is
certain: Since UNSCR 242, only empty promises and continued suffering
have visited the Palestinian people. Perhaps now, it's high time for the
international community to live up to its cant while it still can.
"
"Isr","Neut","After two years of the current armed conflict between Israel and the
Palestinians, both sides are summing up the lessons learned, and each is
taking stock morally. Israel's assessment holds that the confrontation
was planned in advance with the objective of forcing it to make
concessions. A few months prior to the conflict, an Israeli Intelligence
estimate predicted that the Palestinians would initiate violent
activities if they did not attain their demands through negotiation. In
so doing, the Palestinians withdrew from the commitment, given by
Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat in his letter to Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, not to use violence to obtain political objectives.

Just as the Palestinian side incorrectly assessed Israeli society and
its reactions, so too the Israeli side failed to understand the serious
internal pressures under which the Palestinian population labored after
the Oslo agreements: its economic situation deteriorated despite the
agreements, while it interpreted the expansion of Israeli settlements as
the intensification of Israeli occupation. One way or another, Arafat's
great mistake was in not stopping the military conflict at a relatively
early stage.

On the Israeli side, the overriding consideration was the decision in
principle that under no circumstances would it offer concessions as a
consequence of the use of terrorism and violence against it. If
substantive concessions were to be made--then only at the negotiating
table. Israel has held to this position successfully, with the backing
of its public, most of which has for some time favored the establishment
of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.

The primary Palestinian objective is understood to be the desire to
cause maximum civilian casualties, particularly within the Green Line.
Two years after the outbreak of violence the number of Israeli dead
exceeds 600, most of them civilians rather than soldiers. It is this
fact that has most influenced Israeli public opinion and brought about a
change in the political views of Israeli society, weakening the Israeli
""peace camp"" and reducing the chances that the Labor Party will return
to power in the foreseeable future.

An additional Palestinian objective was to bring about the
internationalization of the conflict, and to cause international forces
to be deployed in the territories while the conflict rages. While this
proposal was raised repeatedly in the United Nations, it was thwarted. A
further Palestinian goal in Israeli eyes was the effort to generate
active involvement, including a military threat, by Arab states.
Although Egypt removed its ambassador at an early stage of the
confrontation, the conflict never spilled across the border, even when
the Palestinian Authority was reoccupied. Nor was a ""second front""
opened by Hizballah along Israel's northern border. In a number of Arab
countries, the leadership perceived Arafat as the party jeopardizing
regional stability. One reflection of this approach is the Saudi
initiative, which can be read as a signal to Arafat that the Arab states
cannot wait forever for him to produce a peace initiative; hence they
are bypassing him with their own proposal.

While the concept of ""Israeli occupation"" has penetrated international
opinion, the Palestinians failed to persuade the world public that
murderous terrorist acts against civilians are justified. Their failure
was particularly evident after 9/11. Arafat's standing in Washington
totally collapsed. Israel was able to show that the steps he took to
prevent terrorism were at best cosmetic and tactical. The failure of the
Zinni and Tenet missions due to vicious terrorist attacks inside Israel
persuaded Washington of the justice of Israel's argument. The US also
accepted that Arafat was personally linked to the Iranian arms ship
Karine A. When Washington declared that it rejects contact with him and
expects him to be replaced by a leadership that will resume
negotiations, this was a personal strategic failure on Arafat's part.

Israel has twice besieged Arafat in his headquarters in Ramallah. This
was a mistake, for in so doing Israel managed to refocus attention on
Arafat and in fact delay reforms within the Palestinian Authority. Here
it is important to note that the demand for reforms and for transparency
in the Palestinian Authority is supported by the European Union. In this
sense there is a very widespread perception that the administration of
the PA is dysfunctional.

The American turnabout is particularly striking in that it touches on
the military sphere as well. Compare the angry American reaction on
April 16, 2001, when an Israeli force penetrated Beit Hanun in the Gaza
Strip and intended to remain there for the night, to Washington's
silence when the IDF initiated two far-reaching operations in the West
Bank--in April-May 2002, when it entered the refugee camps, and in June
when in effect most of Area A was occupied. One can only conclude that
the US has in effect given Israel a free hand to take major military
steps in its war against Palestinian terrorism. This is a net
achievement for Israel, if it exploits it for a political initiative.

If causing damage to Israel can be considered a success, then the
Palestinians registered achievements. First and foremost is the damage
embodied in the crisis generated between Israel and its Arab minority.
Here the Palestinians succeeded in expanding the military conflict to
include elements that were not actively involved previously. Scores of
Israeli Arabs have been apprehended for involvement in serious acts of
terrorism. The damage will inevitably influence Israel's position
regarding a variety of issues. For one, there is a far deeper perception
that Arafat intends to destabilize Israel from within, and that the
struggle is over the existence of the state of Israel. The immediate
reaction is Israel's tough rejection of proposals that any Palestinian
refugees return to Israeli territory.

These developments have also influenced the idea of a separation fence
along the border. The settlers reject the idea, insofar as they
interpret this as leaving them ""beyond the fence;"" but public pressures
to take unilateral steps continue to grow. The separation fence projects
a negative psychological connotation in that it constitutes a statement
by the Israeli public that it has lost hope in reaching agreements with
the Palestinians. The overall psychological import is, in non-diplomatic
terms: we don't want you in our midst. Better to bring guest workers
from all over the world, rather than risk acts of terrorism on our
territory. This can hardly be considered an achievement by Arafat. In
general, the Palestinians cannot claim that the armed conflict they
initiated improved their chances for realizing their aspiration to
establish a viable Palestinian state.

In Israel there is an understanding of the natural limitations of
military force with regard to conflicts in which ethnic and religious
elements predominate. A decisive military victory cannot be attained in
such a war. For example Israel, like others, has no military solution
for suicide terrorism. Moreover, Israel's operational achievements
clearly do not have a life of their own, especially if they are not
exploited for political initiatives. Since the Sharon government took
over, Israel has no genuine, comprehensive political initiative, just as
the Palestinians lack such a genuine political plan. Hence the current
conflict is not over. Additional chapters await us.
"
"Pal","Neut","Initially, the Intifada acquired a non-violent popularity that continued
for some time. But the Israeli government drowned the Intifada in blood
when its army, lead by the extremist General Shaul Mofaz, killed no less
than 200 Palestinian civilians and injured around 2,000. Among them were
13 Palestinian citizens of Israel who were shot by police bullets that
also wounded hundreds of others. All of this took place before a single
Israeli was killed in the confrontations. Israel defined the rules of
the game in a way that guaranteed it become an arena of escalating,
violent confrontation. This was the easier and more advantageous
approach for Israel, since it is the stronger side.

Every battle has a goal. The Palestinian people have made clear that
their permanent goal is to end the occupation. The Israeli side, for its
part, has emphasized that its goal is to guarantee Israeli security.
Examining these two goals, it is difficult to discuss successes after
two years of continued bloody confrontation. Palestinians see blood and
destruction everywhere, and I believe that Israelis have a persistent
feeling of lost security. But although the material and human losses
have varied, the losses on the Palestinian front have been far greater
than on the Israeli side. The number of civilians killed by the Israeli
army is many times greater than the number of civilians killed by the
Palestinian resistance.

The Palestinian people cannot claim that they have made steps towards
freedom and independence, and the Israeli government cannot claim that
it has created security for its citizens or succeeded in actualizing an
economic revival. On the contrary, the glaring results confirm a fact
that has been overlooked during the last two years: that the complex,
many faceted conflict cannot be settled by crude military force or
violence alone. This is a fact that the extreme right government in
Israel has not been convinced of, despite that it has used up all means
of oppression against the Palestinian people. And so the confrontation
will continue.

It could be said that both sides are in a crisis. Both hanging from a
high tree, each has lost the ability to offer the other a ladder to
climb down on. The Israeli government did not try to invest in the more
than forty days without suicide operations to create a less bloody
atmosphere serving as an exit point for both sides. Instead, the Israeli
government continued its crimes and siege. Israel has only succeeded in
creating a wounded, frustrated and hungry neighbor. And to some degree
or another, we have participated in creating a tense and nervous Israeli
neighbor that is uncertain of its future, thus making the situation
extremely complicated.

Neither negotiations nor confrontation have brought freedom to
Palestinians or security to Israelis. Thus both camps are going to
collectively resort to radical ideological forces, and the confrontation
will take an ideological form in the future that will not stand for or
work with middle of the road solutions. Should this happen, I believe
that we may disappoint a generation that believes in a historical
solution on the basis of two states for two people. And here the losses
of Israelis seem greater to me.

But while Palestinian losses have been so great as to be uncountable,
Palestinians will also ""lose"" the corruption fostered by Israel, which
thought that it could create a leadership that would peacefully coexist
with Israel but not end the occupation. Among the few things that might
be described as Palestinian successes is the failure of this plan for a
corrupt Palestinian leadership. Indeed, its failure may lead to the
appearance of a leadership that is more credible and committed to the
cause of the Palestinian people.

The Intifada has also enabled the Palestinian people to reclaim their
right to resist the occupation, a right that had been taken away by the
Oslo Accords, which at the same time did not guarantee a halt to
settlement construction. Because of this, it is difficult to talk about
the achievements of the last two years.

Among the things that Israel lost was its image as a state that claims
to be democratic. Under confrontation, its image has quickly regressed
to that of a racist, right wing militarized state. This can be seen in
the dominant presence of military leaders in Israeli politics. It also
lost an opportunity that had begun to take hold in recent years--the
opportunity to become a normalized state in the region. The bloody
scenes seen daily by tens of millions of Arabs have returned the old
image of Israel to their minds and returned the struggle to its original
form.
"
"Isr","Neut","Since Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) took formal control over the Palestinian
Authority, he appears to be moving in a direction that his predecessor
avoided, focusing on a ceasefire or hudna. After more than four years of
hard fighting against murderous terrorism, the question we Israelis have
to ask ourselves in this context is not an easy one. On the one hand,
who isn't happy to live in peace and quiet, without terror on the
streets and Qassam rockets landing on Sderot? But on the other, a hudna
clearly does not permit an offensive against the terrorist
infrastructure, and this could entail a significant cost in the future.

During the past three years of the war against terror, the Shabak
(General Security Service) and the Israel Defense Forces succeeded in
reaching and silencing nearly every terrorist activist in Judea and
Samaria. Today the level of terrorism in Judea and Samaria is very low,
mainly due to the IDF's success, with the fence contributing in several
important regions. In contrast, in the Gaza Strip, precisely because the
territory was never reoccupied, the IDF's success is very limited. In a
few unusual operations the Hamas leadership was badly hit, but the
capacity to produce Qassams--the primary threat from Gaza--was not
constrained.

The option of re-conquering all or part of Gaza was apparently under
discussion just prior to the hudna. Had the IDF embarked on such an
operation it would have produced a different capability for combating
terrorism that emanates from Gaza: after a few months of occupation the
level of terrorism there would also have dropped markedly.

The hudna stopped the military dynamic; now we are beginning to discuss
a political dynamic. But lest we forget, in parallel with the political
peace process and the talks between the sides, the ceasefire will enable
the terrorist elements to refurbish, rebuild their capabilities, train
their activists, acquire ordnance, and rest. The terrorists will be that
much more prepared on the day when someone in Ramallah or Damascus, Gaza
or Tehran decides that the time is ripe to renew terrorist attacks. The
worst damage will be in Judea and Samaria, where the terrorist
organizations have a genuine interest in a ceasefire as their only means
of salvation--in view of the intelligence and operational steamroller
the IDF has deployed since Operation Defensive Shield in April 2002.

Shielded by a temporary quiet, as the hudna is historically defined, the
Palestinians will seek to renew the political peace process. Should
Israel agree? Based on the experience gained here since the Oslo
Accords, the answer must be an unequivocal ""no"". Every time Israel
ignored Palestinian efforts to rebuild a terrorist capability while the
sides were engaging in political contacts, it paid in blood. Back at the
beginning, in 1995, when the late Yitzhak Rabin was prime minister,
Yasser Arafat and Mohammed Dahlan allowed Yihya Ayash to operate in Gaza
and prepare the explosive devices that killed Israelis. We learned then,
the hard way, that a leadership that does not constantly fight terrorism
eventually gives in to it. Nor is there any realistic way to wake up
late, once the terrorist organizations have regrouped, and stop them.

Thus in my view, anyone who allows terror to regroup under his
governance cannot be a viable partner for peace negotiations. If Israel
agrees to this, it will repeat the mistake made in 1994, when Arafat
entered the territories and prevented any attempt to deal with the
terrorist elements. We paid for that mistake in blood, a lot of blood,
as did the Palestinians. Hence I believe that a determined attempt by
Abu Mazen to fight the terrorists is in the long-term Palestinian
interest as well. Wherever there is less terror there is also less
suffering on the part of the population and fewer casualties.

Accordingly, we have no alternative. Israel must condition a return to
political negotiations on the readiness of the Palestinian security
establishment to act against the terrorist organizations, arrest their
leaders, disarm them, destroy their explosives laboratories, and take
immediate steps to cease all incitement to terrorism. The incitement
must stop not only on television and in the official press, but also in
the mosques, the schools and the street banners.

Whoever wants to qualify as a peace partner cannot permit incitement to
murder the people with whom he is negotiating. He certainly should not
be allowed to shelter those who are preparing their weapons for the next
terrorist war.
"
"Pal","Neut","Among Palestinians the hot topic of the day is what exactly is the
nature of the understandings that appear to have been reached between
President Mahmoud Abbas and the factions. There have been many educated
guesses--some say a truce or ceasefire was agreed upon while others say
what happened was simply a ""calming"" and not a truce in the true sense.

The wording is very important, and goes some way to explain the attitude
of the factions. Abu Mazen knew that the factions would not respond to a
demand for a full truce if they did not get guarantees in return that
Israel would halt all its military operations against the Palestinians,
especially the assassinations, incursions and house demolitions. Israel
has responded to the current calm unenthusiastically, and is simply
issuing official statements. Abu Mazen has received no formal guarantees
of anything yet.

It is in this context that the statements of Hamas and other factions
must be understood. The factions have already declared that what is
happening is only a calming of the situation, with Hamas saying that,
""it would not accept a truce except in the context of the higher
interests of the people and an integral policy congruent with the
challenges of the coming phase"". The movement said it considered this an
inappropriate time for any talk about a truce or ceasefire since the
Israeli army is continuing its crimes against the Palestinian people in
the Gaza Strip.

Statement after statement from the factions come back to the same point.
What matters is what happens on the ground, and for as long as people
are killed--recently a three-year-old girl, Rahma Abu Shamas, on January
26--the factions will take this as a signal that Israel is not prepared
to encourage the calm.

According to PA sources, Abu Mazen has received ""definite promises"" that
the Israeli government will halt assassinations and incursions, and has
informed the factions of this. The sources said Abu Mazen did not
release his statement about the truce until he had confirmed the Israeli
position and after the meeting between Israeli defense minister Shaul
Mofaz and former public security minister Mohammed Dahlan, which
resulted in an understanding to transfer security authority in five West
Bank cities to the PA and to further deploy Palestinian security forces
in the northern and southern Gaza Strip. An Israeli official had
previously announced that the army would halt ""targeted liquidations"" of
Palestinian activists if Palestinian police enforce calm and security.

But the factions are liable to want formal guarantees of a cessation of
Israeli violence, as well as clear signals of intent, including a
release of prisoners. One Hamas leader, Mahmoud Zahhar, was recently
quoted as saying that ""We will not grant calm except in exchange for a
national price, the first of which is the release of all prisoners. We
will not allow the calm to continue if any prisoner of any political
color remains in jail.""

The factions also remain skeptical regarding what any ceasefire is
likely to bring on the political track. One anonymous Hamas source
recently told me that it ""is not right for Hamas to offer Abu Mazen a
truce [simply] for him to return to the same erroneous political track
that was taken by Arafat"". On this track, he added, Hamas ""must have a
role"".

Thus the factions are likely to remain extremely cautious for the time
being. None of them trust Israeli statements, and most remember that the
hudna of 2003 was ended by Israeli actions. While a temporary calm has
been called, the ball is firmly in Israel's court if it is to turn into
something more lasting and solid.
"
"Isr","Neut","The declarations by the left wing organizations were threatening. ""If
Israel exploits the war in Iraq to carry out a transfer of Arabs,"" one
of them stated, ""this will be a war crime."" Israel Defense Forces
soldiers were warned ""not to take part in war crimes lest they be placed
on trial by the International Court."" Additional manifestos warned that
the new government would exploit the fog of battle to establish new
settlements--also defined as illegal acts that it would be a crime to abet.

In reality, all the shooting was into the air. Israel, which in any
event had no intention of expelling Arabs, in effect even ceased
carrying out targeted assassinations. During the two weeks since the war
in Iraq began, and despite pinpoint terrorism warnings from the police
and the Shabak (General Security Service), the Palestinians' casualties
were the lowest since their brutal terror war began. Even the bombing in
Netanya on March 30, the twelfth there in two and half years, seems not
to have altered this Israeli policy approach.

Paradoxically, the only ""mini-transfer"" carried out during the war has
been against Jews. On March 25, late at night, soldiers and police broke
into the home of the Ozeri family on a hill, known as hill 26, in Kiryat
Arba, and terrified the widow and children of the late Yoni Ozeri, who
was murdered around two months ago by Arab terrorists. They scattered
everything in the house, as if they had burst into the home of
terrorists, and dragged the mother and her children--who had still not
recovered from the earlier terrorist trauma--out of the house. Friends
of the dead husband who were sleeping in the house to protect the woman
and her children were also removed by force and beaten by the troops.

Hill 26 is one of the so-called ""illegal outposts."" Some observers
estimate that in the course of the past two and a half years since the
conflict began, more than 100 such outposts have been established. One
of them, the Gilead Ranch in Samaria, was the scene some four months ago
of one of the worst events of recent years: soldiers and police who had
been dispatched to evacuate the ranch on the orders of Labor Party
Minister of Defense Binyamin Ben Eliezer, encountered strong resistance.
The violent confrontation between the security forces and the young
settlers, frequently called ""hill youth,"" shocked the country.

Ben Eliezer, who was already planning the withdrawal of his party,
Labor, from the national unity government headed by Ariel Sharon,
thought he could reap political dividends from this act. But the forced
evacuation, which initially appeared to help him politically, actually
turned into the first act not only in his political decline--he was
removed from the party leadership post--but in that of his party as
well, which had ruled the country for so long: we recall that it
suffered a painful defeat in the recent elections.

Many have asked themselves how a brutal evacuation like that of hill 26
could be carried out when the government is headed by Ariel Sharon and
the Ministry of Defense by Shaul Mofaz. The mystery grows when we
consider that the governing coalition includes National Religious Party
ministers like Efi Eitam, who is described as an extreme rightist (the
NRP received about one fourth of the settler vote in the last
elections), as well as the National Union Party, which has adopted
transfer as one of its slogans.

The answer to this question, as understood by the settler leadership, is
in three parts:

    1. Prime Minister Sharon wants to signal the United States
    president, who is under pressure concerning the roadmap from Arab
    states and from British Prime Minister Tony Blair, that he was
    sincere when he promised, at their last meeting in Washington, that
    there would be no new settlements. He picked the weakest link among
    the settlers: followers of Rabbi Kahane, one of whom was the late
    Ozeri, who enjoy minimal support among the settlers at large and are
    generally opposed by the traditional leadership of the Yesha Council
    (Council of the Communities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza).

    2. This is also a broad hint to the settler activists: they will not
    be allowed to establish any more unauthorized outposts. If they do
    so, they will be treated like the residents of hill 26.

    3. ""Only a right wing government can deliver,"" i.e., the Gilead
    Ranch was the scene of a pitched battle because a minister of
    defense from the Labor Party, enemy of the settlements, gave the
    evacuation order. Faced with a similar directive from a right wing
    government that comprises the NRP and the National Union, the
    settlers would not dare indulge in violent opposition. Witness hill 26.

In private conversations, the heads of the NRP and the National Union
state that they did not join the government to establish additional
settlements. They understand that international circumstances prohibit
such an option. We'll suffice, we hear them say, with preventing removal
of the outposts, and certainly of veteran settlements. But they are not
particularly hopeful at a time when the roadmap                        
is evolving, with Sharon's concurrence and Likud backing, into the next
peace process--what they call ""the Likud's Oslo.""
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: Since the forming of the new Israeli government has
settlement expansion decreased, stopped or is it on the rise?

A: Israel has been focusing recently on housing units in
Jerusalem and around Jerusalem, in what we call ""metropolitan
Jerusalem."" Near the green line around Jerusalem, there is new
infrastructure being built for new housing units, but in the Jordan
Valley or in the middle of the West Bank, the majority of the
construction is near the main roads, or what Israel desires for its
final status borders.

When you look at Modiin bloc [near Jerusalem], there is a new
neighborhood and new housing unit under construction. Givat Zeev has a
new neighborhood under construction that will create 654 housing units.
According to the Israeli vision, Givat Zeev will eventually fall inside
metropolitan Jerusalem. This is why Israel established the ""separation
line"" and increased the settlement in this area. Near Modiin or what we
call Latroun, Israel wants to annex this area and so it is expanding its
settlement in this place.

The total number of settlers in the West Bank in 2002 was 205,000
settlers. In 2003, that population has grown to 218,000. In the Modiin
bloc alone, the number of settlers has increased from 15,000 to
17,000--2,000 more. In Givat Zeev, the settlers in 2002 numbered 11,000;
today they are 12,500.

Q: How does the Israeli government usually confiscate
Palestinian land for settlements?

A: Most of the land settlements are being built on was
confiscated many years ago. In Givat Zeev, the land was confiscated in
1979 and in Modiin, it was confiscated in 1990.

More recently, land has been confiscated to build bypass roads [that
connect settlements], especially in the Hebron area and northwest of
Jenin, in what we call the Rihani bloc. There, the Palestinians were
told last year that this is ""state land."" To confiscate land, Israel
uses either a military order or a demand that it is needed for public
purposes, or it says that this is ""state land."" Although we often take
these cases to court, the Palestinians almost always lose.

Q: Why can't the Palestinians prove that they own the land?

A: They often have no documents saying that they own the land,
because under Jordanian law or in the British Mandate period, they were
given no documents stating that the land is registered. The Israeli
court demands these documents, but the Palestinians can't produce them.

Q: How does the ""separation wall"" fit into Israel's
settlement plan?

A: In its first phase, the wall that is now under construction
started from T'anak and extended to Qalqilya. The new area that it
creates between the new ""separation line"" and the old green line
contains around 11 villages. Most of the land was not confiscated but
placed defacto under Israeli control. The land of some 21 villages falls
behind the line. This land is not declared ""state land,"" but falls under
Israeli control.

After seeing the Taba and Camp David maps, I believe that this land will
eventually be annexed to Israel. More or less, these are the same maps
[as those being used to build the wall today]. According to the Taba and
Camp David maps, Ariel and Kedumim will also fall on the Israeli side,
cutting a wedge 20 kilometers into the West Bank.

The walls that will be built in the Jordan valley are from a map drawn
in 1983 when Ariel Sharon was minister of defense. He created a map with
two lines showing that the Jordan Valley would be under Israeli control
and the west of the West Bank would be under Israeli control, and five
more lines from west to east would be under Israeli control, thus
dividing the West Bank into five pieces.

Q: Do you think that Palestinians have made any mistakes as
they have tried to deal with the settlement issue?

A: We made all the mistakes possible. In Taba, our mistake was
not looking at the map that was drawn at that time, according to
Military Order #50. We Palestinians went to the Supreme Court and froze
that order, but then at the Taba talks, Israel again used this map. So,
as you can see, the West Bank now looks like a mosaic that is based on
this map.

Q: What do you think that Palestinians can do now to combat
settlement expansion?

A: We have drafted many scenarios for the settlements and
perhaps they will fall under Palestinian sovereignty if we arrive at a
real peace. Whether that is realistic or not, according to United
Nations resolutions from 1967 until today, all of these settlements are
illegal and it is our right to discuss their future.

Q: Do you think that the Israeli public really understands
what is happening with settlements today?

A: If you go to Tel Aviv and you ask them where Ariel is, they
don't have any idea.
"
"Isr","Neut","Q: Does Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's revised disengagement
plan deal with any of your objections?

A: Nothing has really been revised. It's essentially the original
plan. My major objection is that it's clear that leaving Gaza
unilaterally at this point will be seen as a victory by the Palestinian
terrorists and will encourage them to do more of the same.

Q: Back in the days of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir you
yourself advocated leaving Gaza. Why do you object now?

A: What has changed is the terrorist attacks on Israel. Now we're
dealing with Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Back then there was no terrorism.

Q: How do you deal with the argument that disengagement is
necessary because the growing West Bank and Gazan population poses an
urgent demographic threat to Israel as a Jewish and a democratic state,
while the spread of the settlements makes it increasingly difficult to
disengage?

A: That argument would have some validity only if we were on the
point of incorporating these areas into Israel. I'm dead set against
illegal settlements. They should have been taken down before they ever
got going.

I don't look forward to dismantling settlements at some time in the
future, but it may become unavoidable. I'd like to believe that under a
peaceful reality we won't have to dismantle settlements. I think the
precedent of turning over territory on condition that it be without a
Jewish presence was established with the Egyptians in Sinai by [Prime
Minister Menachem] Begin and I regret it.

Q: Apropos Egypt, does the projected Egyptian involvement
in restoring security in Gaza have a strategic dimension for Israel?

A: It could have, though I'm not optimistic at all. Egypt is
already in blatant violation of its peace treaty with Israel by not
having an ambassador here and not dealing with the [Rafah] tunnels, so
I'm not optimistic they'll help. [On the other hand], if the Egyptians
are ready to take over the Gaza Strip that would be a significant
development. I'm prepared to give them Gaza. Begin should have done that
years ago. Begin was dead set against even allowing UN observers in
Gaza, not to speak of an Egyptian presence, because he saw Gaza as part
of the Land of Israel.

Q: According to peace process lore from the late 1970s, it
was Begin who offered Gaza to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and the
latter who refused, arguing that it was Palestinian and not Egyptian land.

A: The myth that Begin offered Gaza to Sadat is totally without
foundation. He should have told Sadat that if Egypt wants Sinai back, it
has to take Gaza with it.

Q: Sharon has seemingly created a fait accompli in selling
his disengagement plan to the United States and now to Egypt.

A: In all these negotiations of recent years, all the concessions
offered by Barak and now Sharon, there is of course a cumulative effect
of fait accompli. These are not good negotiation tactics. The second law
of thermodynamics says ""there are no reversible processes in the
universe."" It never goes back to where it was before.

Q: Can Sharon prevail and continue as prime minister under
the current circumstances? Can he ram this plan through?

A: Sharon has very thick skin and can remain in office
indefinitely. I don't think he can push the plan through the Likud, but
given his strength of character he can hang in there. There aren't many
people who would flaunt the results of the Likud referendum.

[At the same time], I don't consider the disengagement plan that Sharon
suddenly put on the table as the ""be all and end all"" of progress in the
Middle East. Unilateral steps have never been a good prescription for
progress in the region.

Q: Are you persuaded by Sharon's rationale for
disengagement-that it is necessary because a political vacuum has been
created that could invite pressures for much heavier territorial
concessions?

A: Not at all. The past years of combat with the Palestinians have
gained Israel serious achievements over Arafat and terrorism, and in
relations with the US. Sharon wasn't facing a vacuum. I don't know why
he adopted this program. He was not under any kind of pressure from the
US to do this.
"
"Pal","Neut","Q: What strikes you the most about this plan, given the
current state of affairs?

A: My very first impression is that it is a major indicator of
Israeli failure. Sharon has failed to pass his initial plan, on the one
hand because of the vote in the Likud, on the other hand because it was
obviously impossible to implement unilaterally.

Last, the plan seems not to have clarified for the Israeli political
elite whether this will put them in any better place in the near future.

Q: What are the implications for the Palestinian Authority?

A: I don't think that there are many implications, strategically
speaking.

Technically speaking, there are many things still unclear. For example,
the plan states that Israel would no longer be responsible for the Gaza
Strip as an occupying force. Nonetheless, [Israel] will be controlling
the borders, airspace, any possibility for third-party intervention, and
humanitarian needs.

The situation will again be that the Gaza Strip will not be free to act.
Palestinians will not be free to act.

On the other hand, there will be a deepening of the current situation
whereby Israel is legally bound to be responsible for the situation in
the occupied territories, but is actually doing nothing vis-a-vis this
responsibility.

Q: What are the implications for the long term?

A: What can be read in the plan is not so different from the Oslo
arrangements--only the fact that the area to be evacuated from Israeli
presence will be a little larger.

Israel is still securing the crossing points to Egypt, the access to the
sea, there is mention of activities along the coastline, and mention of
military infrastructure being transferred to a third party
authorized-obviously--by Israel.

I see really no difference between this and what was happening in [the
Oslo agreements], aside from minor quantitative differences. Too, Oslo
occurred in an atmosphere of supposed good intentions and good will from
both parties, and the atmosphere now is one of bad intentions and distrust.

Q: One of the comments that we keep hearing is the fear
that the Gaza Strip will become the playground of Hamas. Is that an
accurate assessment?

A: I don't believe so. First of all, I am not sure that Hamas is
in a position to take control in the Gaza Strip, and second, even if it
were, I am not sure that it would want to.

Third, I am not sure this is such a major concern for Israel. Do you
imagine that if Israel were concerned about this, it would be acting
unilaterally?

Q: Do you think Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is
serious about this plan?

A: Yes, I think that he is extremely serious about finding a way
out of the deep trouble that he has got Israel into. The situation in
Israel has deteriorated economically, politically, internationally.
Sharon has come to the conclusion that his old dreams are not realizable
and he is seeking ways out. That is the part that he is serious about,
not the plan.

The plan is one of his experiments as far as I can see, and the more
steps there are, the more experimental it is.

The only thing that the plan really does is create a new demographic
reality. The security dimension is really debatable--I don't know how
they define it. The economic situation depends on the West Bank, mainly.

But the demographic situation, based on widening the Philadelphi route
and solidifying control over some West Bank territories, seems the only
sort of ""progress"" that Sharon has accomplished in this plan. And that
existed in the old plan, as well.

"Isr","Neut","The Oslo Agreement from 1993 required solving the refugee problem,
alongside other major issues, before reaching the permanent agreement,
which was due to have been signed by May 1999. It was obvious that if we
did not find a solution for this painful problem, the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict would remain unresolved, even if a
Palestinian state were set up according to agreed borders. The refugee
problem comprises various components: the story of its creation; the
questions ""who created it?"" and ""why hasn't it been solved until now?"";
and the organizational and financial solution.

The Palestinians prefer to start their version of the chain of events
with the Israeli War of Independence of 1948, claiming that the refugees
were expelled by Israel during this war, and that it is their right,
according to United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194, to choose
between return and compensation. The Israelis, however, describe it
differently. According to the Israeli point of view, the Palestinians
made a huge mistake when they rejected the UN's Partition Resolution of
1947, according to which two nations would have been located in
Palestine. Since the Arabs did not find this satisfactory, preferring to
fight with Israel, the situation arose whereby, during the war, some
700,000 Palestinians lost their homes. About half of these Palestinians
lost their homes because they fled, and about half because they were
expelled. UN Resolution 194 was rejected by the Palestinians and by the
Arab countries, as was Prime Minister David Ben Gurion's willingness,
proposed in Lausanne, to absorb 100,000 refugees.

For many years, the Palestinians demanded to set up a secular-democratic
country instead of Israel, and to absorb in this country any refugee who
wished to come. They took the ""Wish to Return"" as mentioned in UN
Resolution 194, and turned it into the ""Right of Return."" The year 1974
saw the beginning of the process of separation from the idea of a
secular-democratic country, and since 1988, the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) has accepted the idea of two states--the State of
Israel and the State of Palestine--coexisting alongside one another. It
was clear to many Palestinians and to the Israelis that even if the
Palestinians insisted upon the principle of the ""Right of Return,"" this
right would be applicable to those who would return to the Palestinian
state, rather than to any person wishing to live in Israel, and that if
a ""Right of Return to Israel"" was granted to the refugees, it would be
tantamount to abolishing the Jewish majority in Israel, practically
overnight.

Until the commencement of the talks with the Palestinian leadership
concerning the permanent agreement, there was an understanding that the
solution of the refugee problem would be found by rehabilitating them in
their current place of residence, relocating them in the Palestinian
State, relocating them in countries which would agree to absorb them,
and paying them compensation. A small number of refugees would be
permitted to enter Israel, under a family reunification plan and special
humanitarian cases. This was also the nature of the understandings
reached between Abu Mazen and myself in 1995.

When the talks began with the Barak government concerning the permanent
agreement, the Palestinians said that the principle of the ""Right of
Return"" must be incorporated as part of the agreement, and that this
principle would be realized in such a way so as not to endanger the
demographic balance in Israel. Israel presented a contrary approach: it
was willing to receive a limited number of refugees, but it absolutely
rejected the principle, claiming that this would in all likelihood lead
to the foundation of two Palestinian states--the new Palestinian state
and the State of Israel, which in a very short time would become a state
with a Palestinian majority.

The Clinton Plan, dated December 2000, made a determination in this
matter and that was agreed upon, in principle, by the two parties. A
solution to the refugee problem would be devised in which the Israelis
would acknowledge the suffering of the refugees, but Israel would not
assume the sole responsibility for their suffering. A committee would be
set up headed by the United States to handle the problem from the
economic aspects; it would be determined that Israel could not accept
the Right of Return within the boundaries of the State of Israel, but
that there would be a Right of Return to the Palestinian State and to
areas which Israel would transfer to the Palestinian State under a land
exchange agreement. It would be determined that the refugees could be
accepted in third countries; that Israel would agree to receive a
certain number of refugees in accordance with its sovereign decision;
that priority would be given to solving the refugee problem in Lebanon;
and that the agreement would be deemed to be the implementation of
Resolution 194.

The Taba talks were based on the Clinton Plan, and indeed it was easy to
reach various understandings at the Taba talks, based on this plan. At
Taba, agreements were reached concerning the nature of personal
compensation, compensation for assets, options of rehabilitation and
absorption in third countries, and compensation for the host countries.
Above all, we were very close to an agreement concerning the story of
the creation of the refugee problem, which described the Israeli
approach and the Palestinian approach to the issue, and their common
denominator. Specific sums of money were not agreed on, nor was the
actual number of refugees which would be permitted to come to Israel.
However, the distance under dispute between the parties was narrowed
substantially, and the Palestinian side agreed that the number of
refugees must be such that it would not damage Israel's character as a
Jewish country.

Regrettably, the refugee issue has become ""proof,"" as it were, of the
""fact"" that it was impossible to reach an agreement between the
Palestinians and Israel, even at a time when Israel was headed by a
particularly moderate government. This claim, however, is quite simply
untrue. The talks at Taba were the best ever held between the parties,
and the closest ever to reaching an agreement. Were it not for the fact
that the talks were held at such a late stage, on the eve of elections
in Israel for a new prime minister, it would have been possible to
complete the Israeli-Palestinian framework agreement at the Taba talks.
If we return to the Clinton-Taba guidelines, we will be able to reach an
agreement on all the open issues, including the refugee problem. And the
quicker we return to these guidelines, the better it will be for all of
us.

"Pal","Neut","The Palestinian refugee problem has always been a thorny and sensitive
issue. While pundits and politicians alike have formulated and
reformulated different scenarios and solutions, one single and unified
stance has yet to be taken. However, I believe that there are certain
points that must be made within the context of the refugee problem,
especially in light of the recent controversy over some of my recent
statements on this issue.

First, the idea of the establishment of a Palestinian state along the
1967 borders is one that is or should be understood to mean that it is
primarily within the borders of this state that the problem of
resettling the refugees will be addressed. This understanding is in no
way inconsistent with United Nations Resolution 194, although of course
that resolution does not necessarily imply such an understanding. It
also accounts for the distinction often heard by Palestinian leaders
between the need to have Israel recognize ""the right of return,"" and the
negotiated agreement between the two sides over the actual
implementation of this right. Ever since the establishment of the State
of Israel (but right up to the negotiations at Camp David), Israel's
position has been that it is in theory prepared to accept a partial
repatriation, with the bulk of the rest of the problem addressed through
material and political compensation. A resolution of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the basis of a two-state solution,
involving as it does a national ceding of part of the Palestinian
homeland to Israel, clearly presumes that the Israeli part of the
homeland will be Israeli, and not Palestinian.

My second point is to say that acceptance of this compromise, and a full
realization of its political implication by the Palestinian people
and/or the leadership at this point is clearly painful. Therefore, the
demand for a Palestinian state, while upholding one basic principle
concerning self-determination and freedom, clearly involves a painful
compromise concerning the wholesale return of Palestinians and their
descendants to their original homes.

Speaking in terms of history, Palestinians could have adopted one of two
possible strategies: one based on individual rights, and the other on
collective or national rights. A strategy based on the first approach
might have been formulated in terms of the struggle for the rights of
return and equality (I have long ago espoused such a strategy only to
find almost total opposition to it in the mid-eighties). A strategy
predicated on the basis of the second approach can be--and eventually
was--formulated in terms of the struggle for the rights of
self-determination and statehood. My contention is that these are two
incompatible strategies, at least in terms of the practicable
international framework. In terms of personal preferences, I would
support the adoption of the first strategy, but I realize it has far
less support, both among Israelis and Palestinians. Furthermore, it is
my contention that, given a balance between collective and individual
rights, giving weight to one clearly and logically supposes a
minimization of the weight accorded to the other. Thus giving a
preference to a national right clearly diminishes from the weight
accorded to an individual right.

I have heard it argued that these two strategies are compatible, not
contradictory. If the aim is to dissolve Israel as a state, then this is
indeed true. But if so, we cannot expect Israel to be a peace-partner in
any negotiations aiming to achieve that end. Therefore, to espouse those
two strategies simultaneously is to opt out of the peace process in
which we have been engaged for the past decade. This may be the option
of some, but it is by no means clear that this is the option of the
majority of the Palestinian people.

Another point that needs to be made as an elaboration in this context is
that while the right of return to individuals is indeed sacrosanct, so
is the national right to freedom from occupation and independence. If
upholding the right of independence detracts from the right of return,
upholding the latter equally detracts from the former. We therefore have
a case of two sacrosanct rights from which we are compelled to choose by
our political circumstance.

Finally, I am on record from the initiation of the Madrid conference as
being in favor of a general referendum on any peace agreement reached
with Israel. If it is possible to reach an agreement concerning our
national right of independence, then this agreement, fully elaborated as
to explain the future implications on individuals, whether refugees or
not, should be presented for a public vote. Options should also be
presented clearly and realistically.

My observations on this issue are clearly analytical, rather than
legalistic or moral. They have to be so given the nature of the conflict
our people are engaged in, for it is neither a conflict in court, nor
before a moral judge.
