<b>The Moratinos "Non-Paper"</b><p></font>

<font size=2 face="verdana" align=left>
The European Union's account of the Taba talks, prepared by EU envoy Miguel Moratinos and published in    Ha'aretz on February 14, 2002 for the first time.</p>   <p align=justify><i>Taba, January, 2001</i></p> <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify"><b>Introduction</b></p>   
<p align=justify>This EU non-paper has been    prepared by the EU Special Representative to the Middle East Process,    Ambassador Moratinos, and his team after consultations with the Israeli and    Palestinian sides, present at Taba in January 2001. Although the paper has no    official status, it has been acknowledged by the parties as being a    relatively fair description of the outcome of the negotiations on the    permanent status issues at Taba. It draws attention to the extensive work    which has been undertaken on all permanent status issues like territory,    Jerusalem, refugees and security in order to find ways to come to joint    positions. At the same time it shows that there are serious gaps and    differences between the two sides, which will have to be overcome in future    negotiations. From that point of view, the paper reveals the challenging task    ahead in terms of policy determination and legal work, but it also shows that    both sides have traveled a long way to accommodate the views of the other    side and that solutions are possible.</p>   <p align=justify>&nbsp;</p>   <p align=justify><b>1. Territory</b></p>   <p align=justify>The two sides agreed that in    accordance with the UN Security Council Resolution 242, the June 4 1967 lines    would be the basis for the borders between Israel and the state of Palestine.</p>   <p align=justify><b>1.1 West Bank</b></p>   <p align=justify>For the first time both sides    presented their own maps over the West Bank. The maps served as a basis for    the discussion on territory and settlements. The Israeli side presented two    maps, and the Palestinian side engaged on this basis. The Palestinian side    presented some illustrative maps detailing its understanding of Israeli    interests in the West Bank.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">The negotiations tackled the    various aspects of territory, which could include some of the settlements and    how the needs of each party could be accommodated. The Clinton parameters    served as a loose basis for the discussion, but differences of    interpretations regarding the scope and meaning of the parameters emerged.    The Palestinian side stated that it had accepted the Clinton proposals but    with reservations.</p>   <p align=justify>The Israeli side stated that    the Clinton proposals provide for annexation of settlement blocs. The    Palestinian side did not agree that the parameters included blocs, and did    not accept proposals to annex blocs. The Palestinian side stated that blocs    would cause significant harm to the Palestinian interests and rights,    particularly to the Palestinians residing in areas Israel seeks to annex.</p>   <p align=justify>The Israeli side maintained    that it is entitled to contiguity between and among their settlements. The    Palestinian side stated that Palestinian needs take priority over    settlements. The Israeli maps included plans for future development of    Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The Palestinian side did not agree to    the principle of allowing further development of settlements in the West    Bank. Any growth must occur inside Israel.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">The Palestinian side    maintained that since Israel has needs in Palestinian territory, it is    responsible for proposing the necessary border modifications. The Palestinian    side reiterated that such proposals must not adversely affect the Palestinian    needs and interests.</p>   <p align=justify>The Israeli side stated that    it did not need to maintain settlements in the Jordan Valley for security    purposes, and its proposed maps reflected this position.</p>   <p align=justify>The Israeli maps were    principally based on a demographic concept of settlements blocs that would    incorporate approximately 80 percent on the settlers. The Israeli side    sketched a map presenting a 6 percent annexation, the outer limit of the    Clinton proposal. The Palestinian illustrative map presented 3.1 percent in    the context of a land swap.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">Both sides accepted the    principle of land swap but the proportionality of the swap remained under    discussion. Both sides agreed that Israeli and Palestinian sovereign areas    will have respective sovereign contiguity. The Israeli side wished to count    &quot;assets&quot; such as Israelis &quot;safe passage/corridor&quot; proposal as being part of    the land swap, even though the proposal would not give Palestine sovereignty    over these &quot;assets&quot;. The Israeli side adhered to a maximum 3 percent land    swap as per Clinton proposal.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">The Palestinian maps had a    similar conceptual point of reference stressing the importance of a    non-annexation of any Palestinian villages and the contiguity of the West    Bank and Jerusalem. They were predicated on the principle of a land swap that    would be equitable in size and value and in areas adjacent to the border with    Palestine, and in the same vicinity as the annexed by Israel. The Palestinian    side further maintained that land not under Palestinian sovereignty such as    the Israeli proposal regarding a &quot;safe passage/corridor&quot; as well as economic    interests are not included in the calculation of the swap.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">The Palestinian side    maintained that the &quot;No-Man's-Land&quot; (Latrun area) is part of the West Bank.    The Israelis did not agree.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">The Israeli side requested and    additional 2 percent of land under a lease arrangement to which the    Palestinians responded that the subject of lease can only be discussed after    the establishment of a Palestinian state and the transfer of land to    Palestinian sovereignty.</p>   <p align=justify><b>1.2 Gaza Strip</b></p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">Neither side presented any    maps over the Gaza Strip. In was implied that the Gaza Strip will be under    total Palestinian sovereignty, but details have still to be worked out. All    settlements will be evacuated. The Palestinian side claimed it could be    arranged in 6 months, a timetable not agreed by the Israeli side.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify"><b>1.3 Safe passage/corridor from    Gaza to the West Bank</b></p>   <p align=justify>Both sides agreed that there    is going to be a safe passage from the north of Gaza (Beit Hanun) to the    Hebron district, and that the West Bank and the Gaza Strip must be    territorially linked. The nature of the regime governing the territorial link    and sovereignty over it was not agreed.</p>   <p align=justify><b>2. Jerusalem</b></p>   <p align=left><b>2.1 Sovereignty</b></p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">Both sides accepted in    principle the Clinton suggestion of having a Palestinian sovereignty over    Arab neighborhoods and an Israeli sovereignty over Jewish neighborhoods. The    Palestinian side affirmed that it was ready to discuss Israeli request to    have sovereignty over those Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem that were    constructed after 1967, but not Jebal Abu Ghneim and Ras al-Amud. The    Palestinian side rejected Israeli sovereignty over settlements in the    Jerusalem Metropolitan Area, namely of Ma'ale Adumim and Givat Ze'ev.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">The Palestinian side    understood that Israel was ready to accept Palestinian sovereignty over the    Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, including part of Jerusalem's Old City.    The Israeli side understood that the Palestinians were ready to accept    Israeli sovereignty over the Jewish Quarter of the Old City and part of the    American Quarter.</p>   <p align=justify>The Palestinian side    understood that the Israeli side accepted to discuss Palestinian property    claims in West Jerusalem.</p>   <p align=justify><b>2.2 Open City</b></p>   <p align=justify>Both sides favored the idea of    an Open City. The Israeli side suggested the establishment of an open city    whose geographical scope encompasses the Old City of Jerusalem plus an area    defined as the Holy Basin or Historical Basin.</p>   <p align=justify>The Palestinian side was in    favor of an open city provided that continuity and contiguity were preserved.    The Palestinians rejected the Israeli proposal regarding the geographic scope    of an open city and asserted that the open city is only acceptable if its    geographical scope encompasses the full municipal borders of both East and    West Jerusalem.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">The Israeli side raised the    idea of establishing a mechanism of daily coordination and different models    were suggested for municipal coordination and cooperation (dealing with    infrastructure, roads, electricity, sewage, waste removal etc). Such    arrangements could be formulated in a future detailed agreement. It proposed    a &quot;soft border regime&quot; within Jerusalem between Al-Quds and Yerushalaim that    affords them &quot;soft border&quot; privileges. Furthermore the Israeli side proposed    a number of special arrangements for Palestinian and Israeli residents of the    Open City to guarantee that the Open City arrangement neither adversely    affect their daily lives nor compromise each party sovereignty over its    section of the Open City.</p>   <p align=justify><b>2.3 Capital for two states</b></p>   <p align=justify>The Israeli side accepted that    the City of Jerusalem would be the capital of the two states: Yerushalaim,    capital of Israel and Al-Quds, capital of the state of Palestine. The    Palestinian side expressed its only concern, namely that East Jerusalem is    the capital of the state of Palestine.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify"><b>2.4 Holy/Historical Basin and    the Old City</b></p>   <p align=justify>There was an attempt to    develop an alternative concept that would relate to the Old City and its    surroundings, and the Israeli side put forward several alternative models for    discussion, for example, setting up a mechanism for close coordination and    cooperation in the Old City. The idea of a special police force regime was    discussed but not agreed upon.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">The Israeli side expressed its    interest and raised its concern regarding the area conceptualized as the Holy    Basin (which includes the Jewish Cemetery on the Mount of Olives, the City of    David and Kivron Valley). The Palestinian side confirmed that it was willing    to take into account Israeli interests and concerns provided that these    places remain under Palestinian sovereignty. Another option for the Holy    Basin, suggested informally by the Israeli side, was to create a special    regime or to suggest some form of internationalization for the entire area or    a joint regime with special cooperation and coordination. The Palestinian    side did not agree to pursue any of these ideas, although the discussion    could continue.</p>   <p align=justify><b>2.5 Holy Sites: Western Wall    and the Wailing Wall</b></p>   <p align=justify>Both parties have accepted the    principle of respective control over each side's respective holy sites    (religious control and management). According to this principle, Israel's    sovereignty over the Western Wall would be recognized although there remained    a dispute regarding the delineation of the area covered by the Western Wall    and especially the link to what is referred to in Clinton's ideas as the    space sacred to Judaism of which it is part.</p>   <p align=justify>The Palestinian side    acknowledged that Israel has requested to establish an affiliation to the    holy parts of the Western Wall, but maintained that the question of the    Wailing Wall and/or Western Wall has not been resolved. It maintained the    importance of distinguishing between the Western Wall and the Wailing Wall    segment thereof, recognized in the Islamic faith as the Buraq Wall.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify"><b>2.6 Haram al-Sharif/Temple    Mount</b></p>   <p align=justify>Both sides agreed that the    question of Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount has not been resolved. However, both    sides were close to accepting Clinton's ideas regarding Palestinian    sovereignty over Haram al-Sharif notwithstanding Palestinian and Israeli    reservations.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">Both sides noted progress on    practical arrangements regarding evacuations, building and public order in    the area of the compound. An informal suggestion was raised that for an    agreed period such as three years, Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount would be    under international sovereignty of the P5 plus Morocco (or other Islamic    presence), whereby the Palestinians would be the &quot;Guardian/Custodians&quot; during    this period. At the end of this period, either the parties would agree on a    new solution or agree to extend the existing arrangement. In the absence of    an agreement, the parties would return to implement the Clinton formulation.    Neither party accepted or rejected the suggestion.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify"><b>3. Refugees</b></p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">Non-papers were exchanged,    which were regarded as a good basis for the talks. Both sides stated that the    issue of the Palestinian refugees is central to the Israeli-Palestinian    relations and that a comprehensive and just solution is essential to creating    a lasting and morally scrupulous peace. Both sides agreed to adopt the    principles and references with could facilitate the adoption of an agreement.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">Both sides suggested, as a    basis, that the parties should agree that a just settlement of the refugee    problem in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolution 242 must lead    to the implementation of UN General Assembly Resolution 194.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify"><b>3.1 Narrative</b></p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">The Israeli side put forward a    suggested joint narrative for the tragedy of the Palestinian refugees. The    Palestinian side discussed the proposed narrative and there was much    progress, although no agreement was reached in an attempt to develop and    historical narrative in the general text.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify"><b>3.2 Return, repatriation and    relocation and rehabilitation</b></p>   <p align=justify>Both sides engaged in a    discussion of the practicalities of resolving the refugee issue. The    Palestinian side reiterated that the Palestinian refugees should have the    right of return to their homes in accordance with the interpretation of UNGAR    194. The Israeli side expressed its understanding that the wish to return as    per wording of UNGAR 194 shall be implemented within the framework of one of    the following programs:</p>   <p align=justify><i>A. Return and repatriation</i></p>   <p align=left>1. to Israel</p>   <p align=justify>2. to Israel swapped territory</p>   <p align=justify>3. to the Palestine state.</p>     <p align=justify><i>B. Rehabilitation and    relocation</i></p>   <p align=justify>1. Rehabilitation in host    country.</p>   <p align=justify>2. Relocation to third    country.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">Preference in all these    programs shall be accorded to the Palestinian refugee population in Lebanon.    The Palestinian side stressed that the above shall be subject to the    individual free choice of the refugees, and shall not prejudice their right    to their homes in accordance with its interpretation of UNGAR 194.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">The Israeli side, informally,    suggested a three-track 15-year absorption program, which was discussed but    not agreed upon. The first track referred to the absorption to Israel. No    numbers were agreed upon, but with a non-paper referring to 25,000 in the   first three years of this program (40,000 in the first five years of this    program did not appear in the non-paper but was raised verbally). The second    track referred to the absorption of Palestinian refugees into the Israeli    territory, that shall be transferred to Palestinian sovereignty, and the    third track referring to the absorption of refugees in the context of family    reunification scheme.</p>   <p align=justify>The Palestinian side did not    present a number, but stated that the negotiations could not start without an    Israeli opening position. It maintained that Israel's acceptance of the    return of refugees should not prejudice existing programs within Israel such    as family reunification.</p>   <p align=justify><b>3.3 Compensation</b></p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">Both sides agreed to the    establishment of an International Commission and an International Fund as a    mechanism for dealing with compensation in all its aspects. Both sides agreed    that &quot;small-sum&quot; compensation shall be paid to the refugees in the    &quot;fast-track&quot; procedure, claims of compensation for property losses below    certain amount shall be subject to &quot;fast-track&quot; procedures.</p>   <p align=justify>There was also progress on    Israeli compensation for material losses, land and assets expropriated,    including agreement on a payment from an Israeli lump sum or proper amount to    be agreed upon that would feed into the International Fund. According to the    Israeli side the calculation of this payment would be based on a    macro-economic survey to evaluate the assets in order to reach a fair value.    The Palestinian side, however, said that this sum would be calculated on the    records of the UNCCP, the Custodian for Absentee Property and other relevant    data with a multiplier to reach a fair value.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify"><b>3.4 UNRWA</b></p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">Both sides agreed that UNRWA    should be phased out in accordance with an agreed timetable of five years, as    a targeted period. The Palestinian side added a possible adjustment of that    period to make sure that this will be subject to the implementation of the    other aspects of the agreement dealing with refugees, and with termination of    Palestinian refugee status in the various locations.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify"><b>3.5 Former Jewish refugees</b></p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">The Israeli side requested    that the issue of compensation to former Jewish refugees from Arab countries    be recognized, while accepting that it was not a Palestinian responsibility    or a bilateral issue. The Palestinian side maintained that this is not a    subject for a bilateral Palestinian-Israeli agreement.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify"><b>3.6 Restitution</b></p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">The Palestinian side raised    the issue of restitution of refugee property. The Israeli side rejected this.</p>   <p align=justify><b>3.7 End of claims</b></p>   <p align=justify>The issue of the end of claims    was discussed, and it was suggested that the implementation of the agreement    shall constitute a complete and final implementation of UNGAR 194 and    therefore ends all claims.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify"><b>4. Security</b></p> <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify"><b>4.1 Early warning stations</b></p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">The Israeli side requested to    have 3 early warning stations on Palestinian territory. The Palestinian side    was prepared to accept the continued operations of early warning stations but    subject to certain conditions. The exact mechanism has therefore to be    detailed in further negotiations.</p>   <p align=justify><b>4.2 Military capability of the    state of Palestine</b></p>   <p align=justify>The Israeli side maintained    that the state of Palestine would be non-militarized as per the Clinton    proposals. The Palestinian side was prepared to accept limitation on its    acquisition of arms, and be defined as a state with limited arms. The two    sides have not yet agreed on the scope of arms limitations, but have begun    exploring different options. Both sides agree that this issue has not been    concluded.</p>   <p align=justify><b>4.3 Air space control</b></p>   <p align=justify>The two sides recognized that    the state of Palestine would have sovereignty over its airspace. The Israeli    side agreed to accept and honor all of Palestine civil aviation rights    according to international regulations, but sought a unified air control    system under overriding Israel control. In addition, Israel requested access    to Palestinian airspace for military operations and training.</p>   <p align=justify>The Palestinian side was    interested in exploring models for broad cooperation and coordination in the    civil aviation sphere, but unwilling to cede overriding control to Israel. As    for Israeli military operations and training in Palestinian airspace, the    Palestinian side rejected this request as inconsistent with the neutrality of    the state of Palestine, saying that it cannot grant Israel these privileges    while denying them to its Arab neighbors.</p>   <p align=justify><b>4.4 Time table for withdrawal    from the West Bank and Jordan Valley</b></p><p align=justify> Based on the Clinton proposal, the    Israeli side agreed to a withdrawal from the West Bank over a 36-month period    with an additional 36 months for the Jordan Valley in conjunction with an    international force, maintaining that a distinction should be made between    withdrawal in the Jordan Valley and elsewhere.</p>   <p align=justify>The Palestinian side rejected    a 36-month withdrawal process from the West Bank expressing concern that a    lengthy process would exacerbate Palestinian-Israeli tensions. The    Palestinian side proposed an 18 months withdrawal under the supervision of    international forces. As to the Jordan Valley the Palestinian side was    prepared to consider the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces for an additional    10-month period. Although the Palestinian side was ready to consider the    presence of international forces in the West Bank for a longer period, it    refused to accept the ongoing presence of Israeli forces.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify"><b>4.5 Emergency deployment (or    emergency locations)</b></p>   <p align=justify>The Israeli side requested to    maintain and operate five emergency locations on Palestinian territory (in    the Jordan Valley) with the Palestinian response allowing for maximum of two    emergency locations conditional on a time limit for the dismantling. In    addition, the Palestinian side considered that these two emergency locations    be run by international presence and not by the Israelis. Informally, the    Israeli side expressed willingness to explore ways that a multinational    presence could provide a vehicle for addressing the parties' respective    concerns.</p>   <p align=justify>The Palestinian side declined    to agree to the deployment of Israeli armed forces on Palestinian territory    during emergency situations, but was prepared to consider ways in which    international forces might be used in that capacity, particularly within the    context of regional security cooperation efforts.</p>   <p align=justify><b>4.6 Security cooperation and    fighting terror</b></p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">Both sides were prepared to    commit themselves to promoting security cooperation and fighting terror.</p>   <p align=justify><b>4.7 Borders and international    crossings</b></p>   <p align=justify>The Palestinian side was    confident that Palestinian sovereignty over borders and international    crossing points would be recognized in the agreement. The two sides had,    however, not yet resolved this issue including the question of monitoring and    verification at Palestine's international borders (Israeli or international    presence).</p>   <p align=justify><b>4.8 Electromagnetic sphere</b></p>   <p align=justify>The Israeli side recognized    that the state of Palestine would have sovereignty over the electromagnetic    sphere, and acknowledged that it would not seek to constrain Palestinian    commercial use of the sphere, but sought control over it for security    purposes.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">The Palestinian side sought    full sovereign rights over the electromagnetic sphere, but was prepared to    accommodate reasonable Israeli needs within a cooperative framework in    accordance with international rules and regulations.</p>   <p align=justify><b>Dispute over Ma'aleh Adumim</b></p>   <p align=justify>The importance of Israel's    recognition of the June 4, 1967 border is that since 1967 (and even today),    Israel's official position has been that UN Security Council Resolution 242    mandates withdrawal from &quot;territories&quot; conquered in the Six Day War. The Arab    position, in contrast, is that the resolution requires withdrawal from &quot;the    territories.&quot; Israel's official refusal to recognize the June 4, 1967 borders    is currently an obstacle to Foreign Minister Shimon Peres in his efforts to    reach an agreement with the chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council,    Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala). There is no Palestinian confirmation of Peres' claim    that the Palestinians have accepted the formulation that a final-status    agreement will be based on Resolution 242.</p>   <p align=justify>Israel agreed to recognize the    June 4, 1967 border as the basis for the border between Israel and Palestine    after the Palestinians agreed in principle to discuss territorial swaps in    the West Bank, as proposed by Clinton, that would enable Israel to annex    parts of the West Bank adjacent to the Green Line (but not parts of Gaza).    The maps presented by the Palestinians at Taba gave Israel 3.1 percent of the    West Bank. That is less than the lower limit proposed in the Clinton plan    (under which the Palestinians would receive 94 to 96 percent of the West    Bank). Israel demanded 6 percent - the upper boundary of the Clinton plan -    plus an additional 2 percent in the context of a leasing agreement. The    Palestinians also rejected Israel's demand that the &quot;no man's land&quot; around    Latrun not be considered part of the West Bank.</p>   <p align=justify>According to the document,    Israel gave up all the Jordan Valley settlements, focusing instead on its    security interests in that area. The dispute centered around the large    stretch of territory between Ma'aleh Adumim and Givat Ze'ev, which contains    both a fairly large Palestinian population and East Jerusalem's most    important land reserves. The Palestinians retracted their earlier readiness    to include these two settlements in the settlement blocs to be annexed to    Israel after realizing that Israel also insisted on annexing the large tract    that joins them - which would mean that Palestinian citizens would suddenly    find themselves in sovereign Israeli territory. Barak instructed his chief    negotiator, Gilad Sher, to tell the Palestinians that the map presented by    then foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, which reduced the area of the    settlement bloc (including the Ma'aleh Adumim-Givat Ze'ev tract) to only 5    percent of the West Bank, had no validity.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">Another dispute that remained    unresolved stemmed from Israel's refusal to accept the Palestinian demand for    a 1:1 ratio between the area of the West Bank annexed to Israel and the parts    of Israel that would be given to the Palestinians in exchange. Israel    proposed a ratio of 1:2, in its favor. In addition, the Palestinians rejected    Israel's proposal that the Halutza Dunes in the Negev, the area of the &quot;safe    passage&quot; between the West Bank and Gaza, and the part of Ashdod Port that    would be set aside for Palestinian use all be considered part of the land    swap. They insisted that the land they received be contiguous with either the    West Bank or Gaza, and that it not include any land that was merely set aside    for their use, over which they would not have sovereignty. (Akiva Eldar)</p>   <p align=justify><b>How long is the Western Wall?</b></p>   <p align=justify>The Clinton proposal paved the    way for understandings in Jerusalem, but it also created the principal    dispute between the two parties.</p>   <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify">An agreement was reached that    East Jerusalem, which would be called Al-Quds, would be the capital of    Palestine. Understandings were also reached regarding a division of East    Jerusalem's neighborhoods such that Jewish neighborhoods would remain under    Israeli sovereignty (other than Har Homa, which the first Jewish families are    just moving into now, and Ras al-Amud), while Arab neighborhoods would be    transferred to Palestinian sovereignty. In addition, it was agreed that parts    of the Old City - the Muslim Quarter, the n Quarter and part of the Armenian    Quarter - would be to the Palestinians.</p>   <p align=justify>But the Clinton proposal did    not help the parties to draw mutually accepted borders between the Open City    - to which both sides agreed - and the surrounding Palestinian areas, on one    side, and Israeli areas, on the other. The Open City is territory that    citizens of both countries can enter without passing through any checkpoints.    The Palestinians wanted it to encompass all of Jerusalem, while the Israelis    wanted it limited to the Old City only.</p>   <p align=justify>And the Clinton proposal    complicated negotiations on the most sensitive issue: the Western Wall.    Clinton had referred to &quot;the holy parts&quot; of the Wall, thereby creating an    opening for the Palestinian claim that only the exposed part of the Wall (the    Wailing Wall) is considered holy to the Jews, and therefore only this part    should be left under Israeli sovereignty. Palestinians claimed the Western    Wall tunnels were part of Haram al-Sharif (the Temple Mount).</p>   <p align=justify>Since the Taba talks ended,    many meetings and seminars have taken place in an effort to close the gaps,    attended by politicians and experts from both sides and from other countries    as well.</p>   <p align=justify><b>Symbols of sovereignty</b></p>   <p align=justify>Israel insisted that it retain    sovereignty over the &quot;safe passage&quot; between Gaza and the West Bank, with the    Palestinians receiving only usage rights to the land. With respect to air    space, however, Israel adopted a more generous approach to the sovereignty    issue. Nevertheless, it demanded rights to the use of Palestinian air space,    including for air force training exercises.</p>   <p align=justify>The document reveals that the    Palestinians expressed a willingness to accept the principle of limitations    on their armaments and even took Israel's security needs into account (they    agreed to three early warning stations and two &quot;emergency locations,&quot;    compared to the five &quot;emergency locations&quot; Israel had sought in addition to    the early warning stations).</p>   <p align=justify>But in all matters relating to    the symbols of sovereignty, the Palestinians took a harder line. They    therefore insisted that an international force man the &quot;emergency locations,&quot;    rather than an Israeli one. And the issue of control over Palestine's    international border remained unresolved for the same reason: the question of    who would man the border control posts.</font>
