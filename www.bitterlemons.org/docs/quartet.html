<b>“Quartet” Joint Statement</font><br><p><font size=2 face="verdana" align=left><i>Following is the text of a joint statement issued by the "Quartet" (United
                          Nations, Russian Federation, the United States and the European Union)
                          following their meeting in New York.</i></font></b><p></font>

<p>
                          United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Russian Foreign Minister Igor
                          Ivanov, U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Danish Foreign Minister Per
                          Stig Moeller, High Representative for European Common Foreign and Security
                          Policy Javier Solana and European Commissioner for External Affairs Chris
                          Patten met in New York today. The Quartet members reviewed the situation
                          in the Middle East and agreed to continue close consultations, as expressed
                          in the Madrid Declaration, to which the Quartet remains fully committed, to
                          promote a just, comprehensive, and lasting settlement of the Middle East
                          conflict. The Quartet expresses its support for the convening of a further
                          international Ministerial meeting at an appropriate time. 
<p>
                          The Quartet deeply deplores today’s tragic killing of Israeli civilians and
                          reiterates its strong and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism, including
                          suicide bombing, which is morally repugnant and has caused great harm to
                          the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a better future.
                          Terrorists must not be allowed to kill the hope of an entire region, and a
                          united international community, for genuine peace and security for both
                          Palestinians and Israelis. The Quartet expresses once again its profound
                          regret at the loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives, and extends its
                          sympathy to all those who have suffered loss. The Quartet members
                          expressed their increasing concern about the mounting humanitarian crisis in
                          Palestinian areas and their determination to address urgent Palestinian
                          needs.
<p>
                          Consistent with President Bush’s June 24 statement, the UN, EU and Russia
                          express their strong support for the goal of achieving a final
                          Israeli-Palestinian settlement which, with intensive effort on security and
                          reform by all, could be reached within three years from now. The UN, EU
                          and Russia welcome President Bush’s commitment to active U.S. leadership
                          toward that goal. The Quartet remains committed to implementing the vision
                          of two states, Israel and an independent, viable and democratic Palestine,
                          living side by side in peace and security, as affirmed by UN Security Council
                          Resolution 1397. The Quartet members, in their individual capacity and
                          jointly, pledge all possible efforts to realize the goals of reform, security and
                          peace and reaffirm that progress in the political, security, economic,
                          humanitarian, and institution-building fields must proceed together, 
                          hand-in-hand. The Quartet reiterates its welcome of the initiative of Saudi
                          Arabia, endorsed by the Arab League Beirut Summit, as a significant
                          contribution towards a comprehensive peace. 
<p>
                          To assist progress toward these shared goals, the Quartet agreed on the
                          importance of a coordinated international campaign to support Palestinian
                          efforts at political and economic reform. The Quartet welcomes and
                          encourages the strong Palestinian interest in fundamental reform, including
                          the Palestinian 100-Day Reform Program. It also welcomes the willingness of
                          regional states and the international community to assist the Palestinians to
                          build institutions of good government, and to create a new governing
                          framework of working democracy, in preparation for statehood. For these
                          objectives to be realized, it is essential that well-prepared, free, open and
                          democratic elections take place. The new international Task Force on
                          Reform, which is comprised of representatives of the U.S., EU, UN Secretary
                          General, Russia, Japan, Norway, the World Bank and the International
                          Monetary Fund, and which works under the auspices of the Quartet, will
                          strive to develop and implement a comprehensive action plan for reform.
                          The inaugural meeting of this Task Force in London July 10 discussed a
                          detailed plan including specific Palestinian commitments. It will meet again in
                          August to review actions in areas including civil society, financial
                          accountability, local government, the market economy, elections, and
                          judicial and administrative reform.
<p>
                          Implementation of an action plan, with appropriate benchmarks for progress
                          on reform measures, should lead to the establishment of a democratic
                          Palestinian state characterized by the rule of law, separation of powers, and
                          a vibrant free market economy that can best serve the interests of its
                          people. The Quartet also commits itself to continuing to assist the parties in
                          efforts to renew dialogue, and welcomes in this regard the recent high-level
                          ministerial meetings between Israelis and Palestinians on the issues of
                          security, economics and reform.
<p>
                          The Quartet agreed on the critical need to build new and efficient
                          Palestinian security capabilities on sound bases of unified command, and
                          transparency and accountability with regard to resources and conduct.
                          Restructuring security institutions to serve these goals should lead to
                          improvement in Palestinian security performance, which is essential to
                          progress on other aspects of institutional transformation and realization of a
                          Palestinian state committed to combating terror.
<p>
                          In this context, the Quartet notes Israel’s vital stake in the success of
                          Palestinian reform. The Quartet calls upon Israel to take concrete steps to
                          support the emergence of a viable Palestinian state. Recognizing Israel’s
                          legitimate security concerns, these steps include immediate measures to
                          ease the internal closures in certain areas and, as security improves through
                          reciprocal steps, withdrawal of Israeli forces to their pre-September 28,
                          2000 positions. Moreover, frozen tax revenues should be released. In this
                          connection, a more transparent and accountable mechanism is being put
                          into place. In addition, consistent with the Mitchell Committee’s
                          recommendations, Israel should stop all new settlement activity. Israel must
                          also ensure full, safe and unfettered access for international and
                          humanitarian personnel. 
<p>
                          The Quartet reaffirms that there must be a negotiated permanent
                          settlement based on UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338. There
                          can be no military solution to the conflict; Israelis and Palestinians must
                          address the core issues that divide them, through sustained negotiations, if
                          there is to be real and lasting peace and security. The Israeli occupation
                          that began in 1967 must end, and Israel must have secure and recognized
                          borders. The Quartet further reaffirms its commitment to the goal of a
                          comprehensive regional peace between Israel and Lebanon, and Israel and
                          Syria, based upon Resolutions 242 and 338, the Madrid terms of reference,
                          and the principle of land for peace.
<p>
                          The Quartet looks forward to upcoming consultations with the Foreign
                          Ministers of Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and other regional partners, and
                          determines to continue regular consultation on the situation in the Middle
                          East at the principals’ level. The Quartet envoys will continue their work on
                          the ground to support the work of the principals, to assist the Task Force
                          on Reform, and to aid the parties in resuming a political dialogue in order to
                          reach a solution to the core political questions.
