The Palestinian Vision of Peace</font></center><br><p><font size=2 face="verdana" align=left><i> Published in the New York Times, February 3, 2002  </i></font></b><p></font>


<font size=2 face="verdana">
<b>Ramallah.</b> For the past 16 months, Israelis and Palestinians have been locked in 
a catastrophic cycle of violence, a cycle which only promises more bloodshed and 
fear. The cycle has led many to conclude that peace is impossible, a myth borne 
out of the ignorance of the Palestinian position. Now is the time for the 
Palestinians to state clearly, and for the world to hear clearly, the 
Palestinian vision.<br>
<br>
But first, let me be very clear. I condemn the attacks carried out by terrorist 
groups against Israeli civilians. These groups do not represent the Palestinian 
people or their legitimate aspirations for freedom. They are terrorist 
organizations and I am determined to put an end to their activities.<br>
<br>
The Palestinian vision of peace is an independent and viable Palestinian state 
on the territories occupied by Israel in 1967, living as an equal neighbor 
alongside Israel with peace and security for both the Israeli and Palestinian 
peoples. In 1988, the Palestine National Council adopted a historic resolution 
calling for the implementation of applicable United Nations resolutions, 
particularly, Resolutions 242 and 338. The Palestinians recognized Israel's 
right to exist on 78 percent of <br>
historic Palestine with the understanding that we would be allowed to live in 
freedom on the remaining 22 percent under Israeli occupation since 1967. Our 
commitment to that two state solution remains unchanged, but unfortunately, also 
remains unreciprocated.<br>
<br>
We seek true independence and full sovereignty: The right to control our own 
airspace, water resources and borders; the right to develop our own economy, to 
have normal commercial relations with our neighbors, and to travel freely. In 
short, we seek only what the free world now enjoys <br>
and only what Israel insists on for itself: the right to control our own destiny 
and to take our place among free nations.<br>
<br>
In addition, we seek a fair and just solution to the plight of Palestinian 
refugees who for 54 years have not been permitted to return to their homes. We 
understand Israel's demographic concerns and understand that the right of return 
of Palestinian refugees, a right guaranteed under international law and United 
Nations Resolution 194, must be implemented in a way that takes into account 
such concerns. However, just as we Palestinians must be realistic with respect 
to Israel's demographic <br>
desires, Israelis too must be realistic in understanding that there can be no 
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict if the legitimate rights of these 
innocent civilians continue to be ignored. Left unresolved, the refugee issue 
has the potential to undermine any permanent peace agreement <br>
between Palestinians and Israelis. How is a Palestinian refugee to understand 
that his or her right of return will not be honored but those of Kosovar 
Albanians, Afghans and East Timorese have been?<br>
<br>
There are those who claim that I am not a partner in peace. In response, I say 
Israel's peace partner is, and always has been, the Palestinian people. Peace is 
not a signed agreement between individuals <br>
- it is reconciliation between peoples. Two peoples cannot reconcile when one 
demands control over the other, when one refuses to treat the other as a partner 
in peace, when one uses the logic of power rather than the power of logic. 
Israel has yet to understand that it cannot have peace while <br>
denying justice. As long as the occupation of Palestinian lands continues, as 
long as Palestinians are denied freedom, then the path to the ``peace of the 
brave'' that I embarked upon with my late partner Yitzhak Rabin, will be 
littered with obstacles.<br>
<br>
The Palestinian people have been denied their freedom for far too long and are 
the only people in the world still living under foreign occupation. How is it 
possible that the entire world can tolerate this <br>
oppression, discrimination and humiliation? The 1993 Oslo Accord, signed on the 
White House lawn, promised the Palestinians freedom by May 1999. <br>
<br>
Instead, since 1993, the Palestinian people endured a doubling of Israeli 
settlers, expansion of illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian land and 
increased restrictions on freedom of movement. How do I convince my people that 
Israel is serious about peace while over the past decade, Israel intensified the 
colonization of Palestinian land from which it was ostensibly negotiating a 
withdrawal?<br>
<br>
But no degree of oppression and no level of desperation can ever justify the 
killing of innocent civilians. I condemn terrorism. I condemn the killing of 
innocent civilians, whether they are Israeli, American or Palestinian, whether 
they are killed by Palestinian extremists, Israeli settlers, or by the Israeli 
government. But condemnations do not stop terrorism. To stop terrorism, we must 
understand that terrorism is simply the symptom, not the disease.<br>
<br>
The personal attacks on me currently in vogue may be highly effective in giving 
Israelis an excuse to ignore their own role in creating the current situation. 
But these attacks do little to move the peace <br>
process forward and, in fact, are not designed to. Many believe that Ariel 
Sharon, Israel's prime minister, given his opposition to every peace treaty 
Israel has ever signed, is fanning the flames of unrest in an effort to delay 
indefinitely a return to negotiations. Regrettably, he has done little <br>
to prove them wrong. Israeli government practices of settlement construction, 
home demolitions, political assassinations, closures and shameful silence in the 
face of Israeli settler violence and other daily humiliations are clearly not 
aimed at calming the situation.<br>
<br>
The Palestinians have a vision of peace: it is a peace based on the complete end 
of the occupation and a return to Israel's 1967 borders, the sharing of all 
Jerusalem as one open city and as the capital of two <br>
states, Palestine and Israel. It is a warm peace between two equals enjoying 
mutually beneficial economic and social cooperation. Despite the brutal 
repression of Palestinians over the last four decades, I believe when Israel 
sees Palestinians as equals, and not as a subjugated people upon <br>
whom it can impose its will, such a vision can come true. Indeed it must.<br>
<br>
Palestinians are ready to end the conflict. We are ready to sit down now with 
any Israeli leader, regardless of his history, to negotiate freedom for the 
Palestinians, a complete end of the occupation, <br>
security for Israel and creative solutions to the plight of the refugees while 
respecting Israel's demographic concerns. But we will only sit down as equals, 
not as supplicants; as partners, not as subjects; as seekers of a just and 
peaceful solution, not as a defeated nation grateful for whatever <br>
scraps are thrown our way. For despite Israel's overwhelming military advantage, 
we possess something even greater: the power of justice.<br>
