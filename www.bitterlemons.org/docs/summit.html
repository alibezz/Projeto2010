The Council of the League of Arab States at the Summit Level, at its 14th
Ordinary Session:
<p>
<li>Reaffirming the resolution taken in June 1996 at the Cairo extraordinary
Arab Summit that a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East is the
strategic option of the Arab countries, to be achieved in accordance with
international legality, and which would require a comparable commitment on
the part of the Israeli Government;
<p>
<li>Having listened to the statement made by His Royal Highness Prince
Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz, the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in
which His Highness presented his initiative, calling for full Israeli
withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since June 1967, in
implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, reaffirmed by
the Madrid Conference of 1991 and the land for peace principle; and for
Israel's acceptance of an independent Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem
as its capital, in return for the establishment of normal relations in the
context of a comprehensive peace with Israel;
<p>
<li> Emanating from the conviction of the Arab countries that a military
solution to the conflict will not achieve peace or provide security for the
parties, the Council:
<p>
1. Requests Israel to reconsider its policies and declare that a just peace
is its strategic option as well.
<p>
2. Further calls upon Israel to affirm:
<p>
a. Full Israeli withdrawal from all the territories occupied since 1967,
including the Syrian Golan Heights to the lines of June 4, 1967, as well as
the remaining occupied Lebanese territories in the south of Lebanon.
<p>
b. Achievement of a just solution to the Palestinian Refugee problem to be
agreed upon in accordance with UN General Assembly Resolution 194.
<p>
c. The acceptance of the establishment of a Sovereign Independent
Palestinian State on the Palestinian territories occupied since the 4th of
June 1967 in the West Bank and Gaza strip, with East Jerusalem as its
capital.
<p>
3. Consequently, the Arab Countries affirm the following:
<p>
a. Consider the Arab-Israeli conflict ended, and enter into a peace
agreement with Israel, and provide security for all the states of the
region.
<p>
b. Establish normal relations with Israel in the context of this
comprehensive peace.
<p>
4. Assures the rejection of all forms of Palestinian patriation which
conflict with the special circumstances of the Arab host countries.
<p>
5. Calls upon the Government of Israel and all Israelis to accept this
initiative in order to safeguard the prospects for peace and stop the
further shedding of blood, enabling the Arab countries and Israel to live in
peace and good neighborliness and provide future generations with security,
stability, and prosperity.
<p>
6. Invites the international community and all countries and organizations
to support this initiative.
<p>
7. Requests the Chairman of the Summit to form a special committee composed
of some of its concerned member states and the Secretary General of the
League of Arab States to pursue the necessary contacts to gain support for
this initiative at all levels, particularly from the United Nations, the
Security Council, the United States of America, the Russian Federation, the
Muslim States and the European Union.
