PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI SECURITY WORK PLAN<br>(The Tenet Work Plan)</font></center><br><p><font size=2 face="verdana" align=left><i>   </i></font></b><p></font>


<font size=2 face="verdana">
The security organizations of the Government of Israel (GOI) and of the Palestinian
Authority (PA) reaffirm their commitment to the security agreements forged at Sharm el-Sheikh in October 2000, embedded in the Mitchell Report of April 2001. 

<p>

The operational premise of the work plan is that the two sides are committed to a mutual, comprehensive cease-fire, applying to all violent activities, in accordance with the public declaration of both leaders. In addition, the joint security committee referenced in this work plan will resolve issues that may arise during the implementation of this work plan. 

<p>

The security organizations of the GOI and PA agree to initiate the following specific, concrete, and realistic security steps immediately to reestablish security cooperation and the situation on the ground that existed prior to 28 September. 

<p>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1. The GOI and the PA will immediately resume security cooperation.</b> 

<p>

A senior-level meeting of Israeli, Palestinian, and U.S. security officials will be held immediately and will reconvene at least once a week, with

mandatory participation by designated senior officials. 

<p>

Israeli-Palestinian District Coordination Offices (DCOs) will be reinvigorated. They will carry out their daily activities, to the maximum extent

possible, according to the standards established prior to September 28, 2000. As soon as the security situation permits, barriers to effective

cooperation--which include the erection of walls between the Israeli and Palestinian sides--will be eliminated and joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols

will be reinitiated. 

<p>

U.S.-supplied video conferencing systems will be provided to senior-level Israeli and Palestinian officials to facilitate frequent dialogue and

security cooperation. 

<p>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2. Both sides will take immediate measures to enforce strict adherence to the declared cease-fire and to stabilize the security environment. </b>

<p>

Specific procedures will be developed by the senior-level security committee to ensure the secure movement of GOI and PA security personnel

traveling in areas outside their respective control, in accordance with existing agreements. 

<p>

Israel will not conduct attacks of any kind against the Palestinian Authority Ra'is facilities: the headquarters of Palestinian security, intelligence,

and police organization; or prisons in the West Bank and Gaza. 

<p>

The PA will move immediately to apprehend, question, and incarcerate terrorists in the West Bank and Gaza and will provide the security

committee the names of those arrested as soon as they are apprehended, as well as a readout of actions taken. 

<p>

Israel will release all Palestinians arrested in security sweeps who have no association with terrorist activities. 

<p>

In keeping with its unilateral cease-fire declaration, the PA will stop any Palestinian security officials from inciting, aiding, abetting, or

conducting attacks against Israeli targets, including settlers. 

<p>

In keeping with Israel's unilateral cease-fire declaration, Israeli forces will not conduct "proactive" security operations in areas under the control of the PA or attack innocent civilian targets. 

<p>

The GOI will re-institute military police investigations into Palestinian deaths resulting from Israel Defense Forces actions in the West Bank and

Gaza in incidents not involving terrorism. 

<p>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3. Palestinian and Israeli security officials will use the security committee to provide each other, as well as designated U.S. officials,

information on terrorist threats, including information on known or suspected terrorist operation in--or moving to--areas under the other's

control. </b>

<p>

Legitimate terrorist and terror threat information will be acted upon immediately, with follow-up actions and results reported to the security

committee. 

<p>

The PA will undertake preemptive operations against terrorists, terrorist safe houses, arms depots, and mortar factories. The PA will provide

regular progress reports of these actions to the security committee. 

<p>

Israeli authorities will take action against Israeli citizens inciting, carrying out, or planning to carry out violence against Palestinians, with

progress reports on these activities provided to the security committee. 

<p>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>4. The PA and GOI will move aggressively to prevent individuals and groups from using areas under their respective control to carry out acts

of violence. In addition, both sides will take steps to ensure that areas under their control will not be used to launch attacks against the other

side nor be used as refuge after attacks are staged. </b>

<p>

The security committee will identify key flash points, and each side will inform the other of the names of senior security personnel responsible

for each flash point. 

<p>

Joint Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) will be developed for each flash point. These SOP's will address how the two sides handle and

respond to security incidents; the mechanisms for emergency contact; and the procedures to deescalate security crises. 

<p>

Palestinian and Israeli security officials will identify and agree to the practical measures needed to enforce "no demonstration zones" and

"buffer zones" around flash points to reduce opportunities for confrontation. Both sides will adopt all necessary measures to prevent riots and

to control demonstration, particularly in flash-point areas. 

<p>

Palestinian and Israeli security officials will make a concerted effort to locate and confiscate illegal weapons, including mortars, rockets, and

explosives, in areas under their respective control In addition, intensive efforts will be made to prevent smuggling and illegal production of

weapons. Each side will inform the security committee of the status and success of these efforts. 

<p>

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) will adopt additional non-lethal measures to deal with Palestinian crowds and demonstrators, and more

generally, seek to minimize the danger to lives and property of Palestinian civilians in responding to violence. 

<p>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>5. The GOI and the PA, through the auspices of the senior-level security committee, will forge--within one week of the commencement of

security committee meetings and resumption of security cooperation--an agreed-upon schedule to implement the complete redeployment of

IDF forces to positions held before September 28, 2000. </b>

<p>

Demonstrable on-the-ground redeployment will be initiated within the first 48 hours of this one-week period and will continue while the

schedule is being forged. 

<p>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>6. Within one week of the commencement of security committee meetings and resumption of security cooperation, a specific timeline will be

developed for the lifting of internal closures as well as for the reopening of internal roads, the Allenby Bridge, Gaza Airport, the Port of Gaza,

and border crossings. Security checkpoints will be minimized according to legitimate security requirements and following consultation

between the two sides.</b>

<p>

Demonstrable on-the-ground actions on the lifting of the closures will be initiated within the first 48 hours of this one-week period and will

continue while the timeline is being developed. 

<p>

The parties pledge that even if untoward events occur, security cooperation will continue through the joint security committee.
