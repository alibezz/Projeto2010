<font size=3 face="verdana" align=left><b>Speech by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="verdana" align=left><i>December 18, 2003</i>



<p>Good Evening, <BR><BR>I 
                  congratulate the organizers of this conference for the 
                  important and interesting gathering which you have held here. 
                  During the past three days, you have been discussing Israels 
                  situation. I, as Prime Minister, am responsible for the 
                  planning and implementation of the measures which will shape 
                  Israels character during the next few years. <BR><BR>We are 
                  all entrusted with the duty of shaping the face of the Jewish 
                  and democratic State of Israel a state where there is an equal 
                  distribution of the burden, as well as the acceptance of 
                  rights and shouldering of duties by all sectors, through 
                  different forms of national service. A state where there is a 
                  good and efficient education system which educates a young 
                  generation imbued with values and national pride, which is 
                  capable of confronting the challenges of the modern world. A 
                  country whose economy is adapted to the advanced global market 
                  of the 21st century, where the product per capita crosses the 
                  $20,000 line and is equal to that of most developed European 
                  countries. An immigrant-absorbing state which constitutes a 
                  national and spiritual center for all Jews of the world and is 
                  a source of attraction for thousands of immigrants each year. 
                  Aliyah is the central goal of the State of Israel. 
                  <BR><BR>This is the country we wish to shape. This is the 
                  country where our children will want to live. <BR><BR>I know 
                  that there is sometimes a tendency to narrow all of Israels 
                  problems down to the political sphere, believing that once a 
                  solution is found to Israels problems with its neighbors, 
                  particularly the Palestinians, the other issues on the agenda 
                  will miraculously resolve themselves. I do not believe so. We 
                  are facing additional challenges, which must be addressed the 
                  economy, educating the young generation, immigrant absorption, 
                  enhancement of social cohesion and the improvement of 
                  relations between Arabs and Jews in Israel. <BR><BR>Like all 
                  Israeli citizens, I yearn for peace. I attach supreme 
                  importance to taking all steps, which will enable progress 
                  toward resolution of the conflict with the Palestinians. 
                  However, in light of the other challenges we are faced with, 
                  if the Palestinians do not make a similar effort toward a 
                  solution of the conflict I do not intend to wait for them 
                  indefinitely. <BR><BR>Seven months ago, my Government approved 
                  the Roadmap to peace, based on President George Bushs June 
                  2002 speech. This is a balanced program for phased progress 
                  toward peace, to which both Israel and the Palestinians 
                  committed themselves. A full and genuine implementation of the 
                  program is the best way to achieve true peace. The Roadmap is 
                  the only political plan accepted by Israel, the Palestinians, 
                  the Americans and a majority of the international community. 
                  We are willing to proceed toward its implementation: two 
                  states Israel and a Palestinian State living side by side in 
                  tranquility, security and peace. <BR><BR>The Roadmap is a 
                  clear and reasonable plan, and it is therefore possible and 
                  imperative to implement it. The concept behind this plan is 
                  that only security will lead to peace. And in that sequence. 
                  Without the achievement of full security within the framework 
                  of which terror organizations will be dismantled it will not 
                  be possible to achieve genuine peace, a peace for generations. 
                  This is the essence of the Roadmap. The opposite perception, 
                  according to which the very signing of a peace agreement will 
                  produce security out of thin air, has already been tried in 
                  the past and failed miserably. And such will be the fate of 
                  any other plan which promotes this concept. These plans 
                  deceive the public and create false hope. There will be no 
                  peace before the eradication of terror. <BR><BR>The government 
                  under my leadership will not compromise on the realization of 
                  all phases of the Roadmap. It is incumbent upon the 
                  Palestinians to uproot the terrorist groups and to create a 
                  law-abiding society, which fights against violence and 
                  incitement. Peace and terror cannot coexist. The world is 
                  currently united in its unequivocal demand from the 
                  Palestinians to act toward the cessation of terrorism and the 
                  implementation of reforms. Only a transformation of the 
                  Palestinian Authority into a different authority will enable 
                  progress in the political process. The Palestinians must 
                  fulfill their obligations. A full and complete implementation 
                  will at the end of the process lead to peace and tranquility. 
                  <BR><BR>We began the implementation of the Roadmap at Aqaba, 
                  but the terrorist organizations joined with Yasser Arafat and 
                  sabotaged the process with a series of the most brutal terror 
                  attacks we have ever known. <BR><BR>Concurrent with the demand 
                  from the Palestinians to eliminate the terror organizations, 
                  Israel is taking and will continue to take steps to 
                  significantly improve the living conditions of the Palestinian 
                  population: Israel will remove closures and curfews and reduce 
                  the number of roadblocks; we will improve freedom of movement 
                  for the Palestinian population, including the passage of 
                  people and goods; we will increase the hours of operation at 
                  international border crossings; we will enable a large number 
                  of Palestinian merchants to conduct regular and normal 
                  economic and trade relations with their Israeli counterparts, 
                  etc. All these measures are aimed at enabling better and freer 
                  movement for the Palestinian population not involved in 
                  terror. <BR><BR>In addition, subject to security coordination, 
                  we will transfer Palestinian towns to Palestinian security 
                  responsibility. <BR><BR>Israel will make every effort to 
                  assist the Palestinians and to advance the process. 
                  <BR><BR>Israel will fulfil the commitments taken upon itself. 
                  I have committed to the President of the United States that 
                  Israel will dismantle unauthorized outposts. It is my 
                  intention to implement this commitment. The State of Israel is 
                  governed by law, and the issue of the outposts is no 
                  exception. I understand the sensitivity; we will try to do 
                  this in the least painful way possible, but the unauthorized 
                  outposts will be dismantled. Period. <BR><BR>Israel will meet 
                  all its obligations with regard to construction in the 
                  settlements. There will be no construction beyond the existing 
                  construction line, no expropriation of land for construction, 
                  no special economic incentives and no construction of new 
                  settlements. <BR><BR>I take this opportunity to appeal to the 
                  Palestinians and repeat, as I said at Aqaba: it is not in our 
                  interest to govern you. We would like you to govern yourselves 
                  in your own country. A democratic Palestinian state with 
                  territorial contiguity in Judea and Samaria and economic 
                  viability, which would conduct normal relations of 
                  tranquility, security and peace with Israel. Abandon the path 
                  of terror and let us together stop the bloodshed. Let us move 
                  forward together towards peace. <BR><BR>We wish to speedily 
                  advance implementation of the Roadmap towards quiet and a 
                  genuine peace. We hope that the Palestinian Authority will 
                  carry out its part. However, if in a few months the 
                  Palestinians still continue to disregard their part in 
                  implementing the Roadmap then Israel will initiate the 
                  unilateral security step of disengagement from the 
                  Palestinians. <BR><BR>The purpose of the Disengagement Plan is 
                  to reduce terror as much as possible, and grant Israeli 
                  citizens the maximum level of security. The process of 
                  disengagement will lead to an improvement in the quality of 
                  life, and will help strengthen the Israeli economy. The 
                  unilateral steps which Israel will take in the framework of 
                  the Disengagement Plan will be fully coordinated with the 
                  United States. We must not harm our strategic coordination 
                  with the United States. These steps will increase security for 
                  the residents of Israel and relieve the pressure on the IDF 
                  and security forces in fulfilling the difficult tasks they are 
                  faced with. The Disengagement Plan is meant to grant maximum 
                  security and minimize friction between Israelis and 
                  Palestinians. <BR><BR>We are interested in conducting direct 
                  negotiations, but do not intend to hold Israeli society 
                  hostage in the hands of the Palestinians. I have already said 
                  we will not wait for them indefinitely. <BR><BR>The 
                  Disengagement Plan will include the redeployment of IDF forces 
                  along new security lines and a change in the deployment of 
                  settlements, which will reduce as much as possible the number 
                  of Israelis located in the heart of the Palestinian 
                  population. We will draw provisional security lines and the 
                  IDF will be deployed along them. Security will be provided by 
                  IDF deployment, the security fence and other physical 
                  obstacles. The Disengagement Plan will reduce friction between 
                  us and the Palestinians. <BR><BR>This reduction of friction 
                  will require the extremely difficult step of changing the 
                  deployment of some of the settlements. I would like to repeat 
                  what I have said in the past: In the framework of a future 
                  agreement, Israel will not remain in all the places where it 
                  is today. The relocation of settlements will be made, first 
                  and foremost, in order to draw the most efficient security 
                  line possible, thereby creating this disengagement between 
                  Israel and the Palestinians. This security line will not 
                  constitute the permanent border of the State of Israel, 
                  however, as long as implementation of the Roadmap is not 
                  resumed, the IDF will be deployed along that line. Settlements 
                  which will be relocated are those, which will not be included 
                  in the territory of the State of Israel in the framework of 
                  any possible future permanent agreement. At the same time, in 
                  the framework of the Disengagement Plan, Israel will 
                  strengthen its control over those same areas in the Land of 
                  Israel which will constitute an inseparable part of the State 
                  of Israel in any future agreement. I know you would like to 
                  hear names, but we should leave something for later. 
                  <BR><BR>Israel will greatly accelerate the construction of the 
                  security fence. Today we can already see it taking shape. The 
                  rapid completion of the security fence will enable the IDF to 
                  remove roadblocks and ease the daily lives of the Palestinian 
                  population not involved in terror. <BR><BR>In order to enable 
                  the Palestinians to develop their economic and trade sectors, 
                  and to ensure that they will not be exclusively dependent on 
                  Israel, we will consider, in the framework of the 
                  Disengagement Plan, enabling in coordination with Jordan and 
                  Egypt the freer passage of people and goods through 
                  international border crossings, while taking the necessary 
                  security precautions. <BR><BR>I would like to emphasize: the 
                  Disengagement Plan is a security measure and not a political 
                  one. The steps which will be taken will not change the 
                  political reality between Israel and the Palestinians, and 
                  will not prevent the possibility of returning to the 
                  implementation of the Roadmap and reaching an agreed 
                  settlement. <BR><BR>The Disengagement Plan does not prevent 
                  the implementation of the Roadmap. Rather, it is a step Israel 
                  will take in the absence of any other option, in order to 
                  improve its security. <BR>The Disengagement Plan will be 
                  realized only in the event that the Palestinians continue to 
                  drag their feet and postpone implementation of the Roadmap. 
                  <BR><BR>Obviously, through the Disengagement Plan the 
                  Palestinians will receive much less than they would have 
                  received through direct negotiations as set out in the 
                  Roadmap. <BR><BR>According to circumstances, it is possible 
                  that parts of the Disengagement Plan that are supposed to 
                  provide maximum security to the citizens of Israel will be 
                  undertaken while also attempting to implement the Roadmap. 
                  <BR><BR>Ladies and Gentlemen, <BR><BR>My life experience has 
                  taught me that for peace, as well as for war, we must have 
                  broad consensus. We must preserve our unity, even in the midst 
                  of a difficult, internal debate. <BR><BR>In the past three 
                  years, the Palestinian terrorist organizations have put us to 
                  a difficult test. Their plan to break the spirit of Israeli 
                  society has not succeeded. The citizens of Israel have managed 
                  to step into the breach, support each other, lend a helping 
                  hand, volunteer and contribute. <BR><BR>I believe that this 
                  path of unity must be continued today. Whether we will be able 
                  to advance the Roadmap, or will have to implement the 
                  Disengagement Plan, experience has taught us that, together, 
                  through broad national consensus, we can do great things. 
                  <BR><BR>Let us not be led astray. Any path will be 
                  complicated, strewn with obstacles, and obligate us to act 
                  with discretion and responsibility. I am confident that, just 
                  as we have managed to overcome the challenges of the past, we 
                  will stand together and succeed today. <BR><BR>We will always 
                  be guided by the words of Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, who 
                  said, on the day after the Declaration of Independence: 
                  <BR><BR>These days, our purpose is only to build the State of 
                  Israel with love and faith, in Jewish brotherhood, and to 
                  defend it with all our spirit, and as long as necessary. We 
                  are still in the midst of a difficult battle, one that has two 
                  fronts: political and military. Let us not embellish our deeds 
                  and, of course, our words, with grandiose names. We must 
                  remain humble. We achieved what we have achieved by standing 
                  on the shoulders of previous generations, and we accomplished 
                  what we have accomplished by preserving our precious legacy, 
                  the legacy of a small nation which has endured suffering and 
                  tribulations, but which is, nevertheless, great and eternal in 
                  spirit, vision, faith and virtue. <BR><BR>I am also a great 
                  believer in the resilience of this small, brave nation, which 
                  has endured suffering and tribulations. I am confident that, 
                  united in the power of our faith, we will be able to succeed 
                  in any path we choose. <BR><BR>Thank you very much, and happy
