<font size=3 face="verdana" align=left><b>Israel's acceptance of the roadmap with 14 reservations</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="verdana" align=left><i>May 27, 2003</i>


<p>
Primary themes of Israel's
remarks
 
<p>
1. Both at the commencement of, and during the
process, and as a condition to its continuance,
calm will be maintained. The Palestinians will
dismantle the existing security organizations and
implement security reforms during the course of
which new organizations will be formed and act to
combat terror, violence and incitement
(incitement must cease immediately and the
Palestinian Authority must educate for peace). 
<p>
These organizations will engage in genuine
prevention of terror and violence through
arrests, interrogations, prevention and the
enforcement of the legal groundwork for
investigations, prosecution and punishment. In
the first phase of the plan and as a condition
for progress to the second phase, the
Palestinians will complete the dismantling of
terrorist organizations (Hamas, Islamic Jihad,
the Popular Front, the Democratic Front, Al-Aqsa
Brigades and other apparatuses) and their
infrastructure; collection of all illegal weapons
and their transfer to a third party for the sake
of being removed from the area and destroyed;
cessation of weapons smuggling and weapons
production inside the Palestinian Authority;
activation of the full prevention apparatus and
cessation of incitement. 
<p>
There will be no progress to the second phase
without the fulfillment of all above-mentioned
conditions relating to the war against terror.
The security plans to be implemented are the
Tenet and Zinni plans. [As in the other mutual
frameworks, the roadmap will not state that
Israel must cease violence and incitement against
the Palestinians]. 
<p>
2. Full performance will be a condition for
progress between phases and for progress within
phases. The first condition for progress will be
the complete cessation of terror, violence and
incitement. Progress between phases will come
only following the full implementation of the
preceding phase. Attention will be paid not to
time lines, but to performance benchmarks (time
lines will serve only as reference points). 
<p>
3. The emergence of a new and different leadership
in the Palestinian Authority within the framework
of governmental reform. The formation of a new
leadership constitutes a condition for progress
to the second phase of the plan. In this
framework, elections will be conducted for the
Palestinian Legislative Council following
coordination with Israel. 
<p>
4. The Monitoring mechanism will be under American
management. The chief verification activity will
concentrate upon the creation of another
Palestinian entity and progress in the civil
reform process within the Palestinian Authority.
Verification will be performed exclusively on a
professional basis and per issue (economic,
legal, financial) without the existence of a
combined or unified mechanism. Substantive
decisions will remain in the hands of both
parties. 
<p>
5. The character of the provisional Palestinian
state will be determined through negotiations
between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. The
provisional state will have provisional borders
and certain aspects of sovereignty, be fully
demilitarized with no military forces, but only
with police and internal security forces of
limited scope and armaments, be without the
authority to undertake defense alliances or
military cooperation, and Israeli control over
the entry and exit of all persons and cargo, as
well as of its air space and electromagnetic
spectrum. 
<p>
6. In connection to both the introductory
statements and the final settlement, declared
references must be made to Israel's right to
exist as a Jewish state and to the waiver of any
right of return for Palestinian refugees to the
State of Israel. 
<p>
7. End of the process will lead to the end of all
claims and not only the end of the conflict. 
<p>
8. The future settlement will be reached through
agreement and direct negotiations between the two
parties, in accordance with the vision outlined
by President Bush in his 24 June address. 
<p>
9. There will be no involvement with issues
pertaining to the final settlement. Among issues
not to be discussed: settlement in Judea, Samaria
and Gaza (excluding a settlement freeze and
illegal outposts); the status of the Palestinian
Authority and its institutions in Jerusalem; and
all other matters whose substance relates to the
final settlement. 
<p>
10. The removal of references other than 242 and
338 (1397, the Saudi Initiative and the Arab
Initiative adopted in Beirut). A settlement based
upon the roadmap will be an autonomous
settlement that derives its validity therefrom.
The only possible reference should be to
Resolutions 242 and 338, and then only as an
outline for the conduct of future negotiations on
a permanent settlement. 
<p>
11. Promotion of the reform process in the
Palestinian Authority: a transitional Palestinian
constitution will be composed, a Palestinian
legal infrastructure will be constructed and
cooperation with Israel in this field will be
renewed. In the economic sphere: international
efforts to rehabilitate the Palestinian economy
will continue. In the financial sphere: the
American-Israeli-Palestinian agreement will be
implemented in full as a condition for the
continued transfer of tax revenues. 
<p>
12. The deployment of IDF forces along the
September 2000 lines will be subject to the
stipulation of Article 4 (absolute quiet) and
will be carried out in keeping with changes to be
required by the nature of the new circumstances
and needs created thereby. Emphasis will be
placed on the division of responsibilities and
civilian authority as in September 2000, and not
on the position of forces on the ground at that
time. 
<p>
13. Subject to security conditions, Israel will
work to restore Palestinian life to normal:
promote the economic situation, cultivation of
commercial connections, encouragement and
assistance for the activities of recognized
humanitarian agencies. No reference will be made
to the Bertini Report as a binding source
document within the framework of the humanitarian
issue. 
<p>
14. Arab states will assist the process through
the condemnation of terrorist activity. No link
will be established between the Palestinian track
and other tracks (Syrian-Lebanese).
